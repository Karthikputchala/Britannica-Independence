Abd el-Krim
Abd el-Krim, in full Muḥammad ibn ʿAbd al-Karīm al-Khaṭṭābī, (born 1882, Ajdir,
Morocco—died February 6, 1963, Cairo, Egypt), leader of the Berber forces during the Rif
War (1921–26) against Spanish and French rule in North Africa and founder of the short-
lived Republic of the Rif (1923–26). A skilled tactician and a capable organizer, he led a
liberation movement that made him the hero of the Maghrib (northwest Africa).
Background
Abd el-Krim was born in the small settlement of Ajdir, across Alhucemas Bay from the
Spanish army’s island presidio of Peñón de Alhucemas. Ajdir belonged to the Aït Youssef
Ou Ali faction of the Beni Urriaguel family, the largest and most-populous Berber group in
the Rif. Abd el-Krim’s father was a literate and learned man who had significant influence
both within and outside his faction, and in the 1880s he was named a qāḍī (Islamic judge)
by Moroccan Sultan Muley Hasan. As early as 1902, Abd el-Krim’s father was designated a
moro amigo (“friendly Moor”) by Spanish military authorities, and he eventually received a
monthly stipend for providing the Spanish with local intelligence and supporting their
cause in the central Rif. That relationship would continue for a number of years, bringing
benefits for his family but also the deep distrust of some of his fellow Berbers.
Abd el-Krim’s initial education was provided exclusively by his father; in 1902 he was sent
to the traditional madrasah (university) of al-Qarawīyīn in Fès, where he studied Islamic
law and classical Arabic grammar and literature for two years. In 1906, as a result of his
father’s ties with the Spanish, he secured a teaching post at a Melilla primary school for
young Moroccan males, a position he would hold until 1913. Additionally, in 1907 he was
hired to edit and write articles in Arabic for El Telegrama del Rif, a daily newspaper in
Melilla. There he defended the advantages of European—especially Spanish—civilization
and technology and their potential to elevate the economic and cultural level of the
Moroccan population. His association with El Telegrama lasted until 1915. In 1910 Abd el-
Krim took a position as secretary-interpreter in the Native Affairs Office in Melilla, which
brought him into close contact with the Spanish military bureaucracy and the town’s civil
society. In that post he gained a reputation for intelligence, efficiency, and discretion.
Break with Spain
With the establishment of the Spanish protectorate in November 1912, Abd el-Krim’s
fortunes improved appreciably. On the basis of his work in the Native Affairs Office he was

named a qāḍī in July 1913, and the following October he was designated qāḍī al-quḍāt
(chief Islamic judge) of Melilla. That position brought not only a great deal of
responsibility and prestige but also the necessity of strictly adhering to Spanish policy.
With the coming of World War I and Spain’s neutrality in the conflict, that adherence
proved problematic. While still a paid Spanish agent, Abd el-Krim’s father surreptitiously
supported German and Arab agents in the Rif. The Spanish authorities were well aware of
those activities, because they were a violation of Spanish neutrality, and were concerned
about the reaction of the French, who closely monitored those dealings.
In light of that, Abd el-Krim was interrogated in August 1915 concerning his father’s
actions and his own views on the German cause. On the basis of that interview, a report
was prepared by Spanish military authorities accusing Abd el-Krim of pro-Central Powers
sentiments, of animosity toward the French, and of supporting an autonomous central Rif
free of direct Spanish administration. That report led to two outcomes: Abd el-Krim’s
incarceration from September 1915 to August 1916 in a Melilla prison, for pro-German and
anti-Spanish sentiments, and the suspension of his father’s pension payments.
Abd el-Krim’s incarceration left a bitter legacy. Although he did return to his judgeship in
May 1917, it was apparent that the Spanish were pressuring his father and him to desist
from supporting the German cause and to back their “pacification” of the central Rif. That
put Abd el-Krim’s family in an untenable position vis-à-vis their own people. In December
1918 Abd el-Krim abandoned his judgeship, called his brother, Muhammad, back from his
studies in Madrid, and joined his father in Ajdir. By 1920 the family had definitively
severed ties with the Spanish authorities and was actively organizing resistance to Spanish
encroachments into the central Rif.
Adb el-Krim during the Rif War
Abd el-Krim proved highly successful at organizing indigenous resistance to Spanish
advances into the central Rif in June–August 1921, and those clashes marked the outbreak
of the Rif War. The poorly organized, trained, supplied, and commanded Spanish conscript
army under Gen. Manuel Fernández Silvestre was routed by Abd el-Krim’s fighters into an
epic retreat from their encampment at Annoual (Anwal) on July 22, 1921. Between 8,000
and 10,000 Spanish troops were killed, a great deal of Spanish weaponry was abandoned,
more than 300 prisoners were captured, and all the territory in the eastern part of the
protectorate that Spain had occupied since 1909 was lost.

Abd el-Krim’s crushing defeat of the Spanish at Annoual catapulted him and his movement
onto the international stage. He was seen as a heroic figure in the Islamic world and as an
example of the courageous fighter standing against European colonialism by the
international left. Support at home, however, proved more complicated. Abd el-Krim had to
use all of his considerable persuasive skills coupled with force to induce the various Rifian
groups to support his campaign. Those efforts eventually resulted in the establishment of
the Al-Jumhūriyyah al-Rīf (Republic of the Rif) in February 1923. In deference to the spirit
of the times, he called himself “president” of the Republic of the Rif’s “cabinet,” which
was composed primarily of his relatives and close allies. His followers, on the other hand,
referred to him by the more-traditional term of mujāhid (“war leader”).
By 1922 the Spanish had taken back nearly all the territory that they had lost in 1921, but,
given the cost and the unpopularity in Spain of the war, most offensive operations were put
on hold. Consequently, the war remained stalemated through late 1924, when Gen. Miguel
Primo de Rivera, who had taken control of the Spanish government by means of a military
coup d’état in September 1923, elected to pursue peace negotiations with Abd el-Krim
while simultaneously withdrawing Spanish forces from the western part of the protectorate.
Neither one of those initiatives was successful, as Abd el-Krim rejected any agreement that
did not recognize the full sovereignty of the Rif and very quickly rushed his forces into the
vacuum created by the retreat. At the apex of his power in early 1925, Abd el-Krim
controlled almost three-quarters of the Spanish protectorate. In the process he replaced a
hierarchical society with a centralized bureaucracy and fighting force, a Muslim legal code,
international trade arrangements, and a nascent network of roads and telecommunications.
Abd el-Krim’s next step was to move his forces across the frontier into the French
protectorate to safeguard his supply lines and important sources of foodstuffs. In that
instance, his Riffian fighters were as successful against the French as they had been against
the Spanish, overrunning dozens of frontline positions, exacting some 6,200 French
casualties, and endangering the important urban centres of Fès and Taza. That success,
however, ultimately doomed the Rifian cause, as it brought together the two colonial
powers in an alliance to put down the uprising. After careful preparation and coordination,
a joint offensive was launched in September 1925, with the Spanish landing some 18,000
troops at Alhucemas Bay and the French inserting some 20,000 troops into the Spanish
protectorate from the south. Abd el-Krim’s forces numbered at most 13,000 men.
Rifian resistance was determined and fierce but ultimately unsuccessful in the face of
overwhelming manpower and the latest in military technology. By the spring of 1926 Abd

el-Krim’s movement was a spent force, and on May 27, 1926, he and his family
surrendered, significantly, to the French rather than to the Spanish.
Exile and after
The French removed Abd el-Krim, his brother, his uncle, and their families to Fès and then
to Casablanca, where they boarded a ship to Marseilles. On September 2, 1926, the ship
sailed for Réunion Island, an isolated French outpost in the Indian Ocean, east of
Madagascar. There Abd el-Krim and his extended family would remain in gilded exile for
the following 20 years. Finally, in 1947 the French acceded to Abd el-Krim’s petition that
he and his family be relocated to France for health reasons and for the education of the
extended family’s children. Although the French plan was to move the group to the south of
France, that arrangement was derailed by a band of Moroccan nationalists who took Abd
el-Krim’s family—apparently against their wishes—from their ship in Port Said, Egypt,
and spirited them to Cairo, where King Farouk offered them asylum.
In Egypt Abd el-Krim associated himself with the Liberation Committee of the Arab West
(Magreb) until he broke with that group in the early 1950s. He continued to give interviews
and to write articles for Arab consumption against European colonialism and for the
liberation of North Africa. Even after Morocco’s independence in 1956, despite the pleas of
Kings Muhammad V and Hassan II and various Moroccan politicians, Abd el-Krim refused
to return to Morocco, giving as his rationale that he would not go back until there was no
longer a French and Spanish military presence in the country.

Abdul Ghaffar Khan
Abdul Ghaffar Khan, (born 1890, Utmanzai, India—died Jan. 20, 1988, Peshawar, Pak.),
the foremost 20th-century leader of the Pashtuns (Pakhtuns, or Pathans; a Muslim ethnic
group of Pakistan and Afghanistan), who became a follower of Mahatma Gandhi and was
called the “Frontier Gandhi.”
Ghaffar Khan met Gandhi and entered politics in 1919 during agitation over the Rowlatt
Acts, which allowed the internment of political dissidents without trial. In the following
year he joined the Khilafat movement, which sought to strengthen the spiritual ties of
Indian Muslims to the Turkish sultan, and in 1921 he was elected president of a district
Khilafat committee in his native North-West Frontier Province.
Soon after attending an Indian National Congress (Congress Party) gathering in 1929,
Ghaffar Khan founded the Red Shirt movement (Khudai Khitmatgar) among the Pashtuns.
It espoused nonviolent nationalist agitation in support of Indian independence and sought

become a member of Gandhi’s inner circle of advisers, and the Khudai Khitmatgar actively
aided the Congress Party cause up to the partition of India in 1947.
Ghaffar Khan, who had opposed the partition, chose to live in Pakistan, where he continued
to fight for the rights of the Pashtun minority and for an autonomous Pushtunistan (also
called Pakhtunistan or Pathanistan; an independent state in the border areas of West
Pakistan). He paid dearly for his principles, spending many years in jail and afterward
residing in Afghanistan. Ghaffar Khan returned to Pakistan in 1972. His memoirs, My Life
and Struggle, were made public in 1969.

Abdullah I of Jordan
Abdullah I and Nayef
Abdullah I
Abdullah I, in full ʿAbd Allāh ibn al-Ḥusayn, (born
1882, Mecca—died July 20, 1951, Jerusalem),
statesman who became the first ruler (1946–51) of the
Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan.
Abdullah, the second son of Hussein ibn Ali, the ruler
of the Hejaz, was educated in Istanbul in what was
then the Ottoman Empire. After the Young Turk
Revolution of 1908, he represented Mecca in the
Ottoman parliament. Early in 1914 he joined the Arab
nationalist movement, which sought independence for
Arab territories in the Ottoman Empire. In 1915–16
he played a leading role in clandestine negotiations
between the British in Egypt and his father that led to
the proclamation (June 10, 1916) of the Arab Revolt against the Ottomans.
On March 8, 1920, the Iraqi Congress, an organization of questionable legitimacy,
proclaimed Abdullah constitutional king of Iraq. But he declined the Iraqi throne, which
was given to his brother Faisal I, whom French troops had driven out of Damascus a year
earlier (July 1920). Upon Faisal’s ascent to the throne, Abdullah occupied Transjordan and
threatened to attack Syria. He gradually negotiated the legal separation of Transjordan from
Britain’s Palestine mandate.
Abdullah aspired to create a united Arab kingdom encompassing Syria, Iraq, and
Transjordan. During World War II (1939–45), he actively sided with the United Kingdom,
and his army, the Arab Legion—the most effective military force in the Arab world—took
part in the British occupation of Syria and Iraq in 1941. In 1946 Transjordan became
independent, and Abdullah was crowned in Amman on May 25, 1946. He was the only
Arab ruler prepared to accept the United Nations’ partitioning of Palestine into Jewish and
Arab states (1947). In the war with Israel in May 1948, his armies occupied the region of
Palestine due west of the Jordan River, which came to be called the West Bank, and
captured east Jerusalem, including the Old City. Two years later he annexed the West Bank
territory into the kingdom—thereupon changing the name of the country to Jordan. That
annexation angered his former Arab allies, Syria, Saudi Arabia, and Egypt, all of which
wanted to see the creation of a Palestinian Arab state on the West Bank. Abdullah’s

of his son Talal, who suffered from severe mental illness, was brief. A second son, Nayef,
was passed over, and the throne soon went to Talal’s son Hussein.

Abigail Adams
Abigail Adams, née Abigail Smith, (born November
22 [November 11, Old Style], 1744, Weymouth,
Massachusetts [U.S.]—died October 28, 1818,
Quincy, Massachusetts, U.S.), American first lady
(1797–1801), the wife of John Adams, second
president of the United States, and mother of John
Quincy Adams, sixth president of the United States.
She was a prolific letter writer whose correspondence gives an intimate and vivid portrayal
of life in the young republic.
Born to William Smith, a Congregational minister, and Elizabeth Quincy Smith, Abigail
was the second of four children. Educated entirely at home, she read widely in her father’s
large library, and the constant flow of interesting, intelligent, and well-educated guests at
the Smith home turned her into a learned, witty young woman. For her introduction to great
literature, she credited her brother-in-law, Richard Cranch.
Abigail’s plans to marry John Adams, a Harvard-educated lawyer nine years her senior, did
not gain the immediate approval of Smith, who considered a lawyer’s prospects inadequate.
When they married on October 25, 1764, the bride’s father, who performed the ceremony,
amused the guests by citing a passage from the Book of Luke: “John came neither eating
bread nor drinking wine and some say he has a devil in him.” During the first 10 years of
their marriage Abigail gave birth to five children, including a daughter who died in infancy
and John Quincy Adams.
She managed the second decade of her marriage on her own, as John participated in the
colonial struggle for independence as a member of the Continental Congress and later as a
representative of his country in France. Their correspondence during these years, especially
when added to the spirited letters penned earlier during their courtship, provides a rich
account of their activities and thinking as well as their love and devotion to each other. It is
from these letters that historians, including the Adamses’ grandson Charles Francis Adams,
have concluded that Abigail played a significant role in her husband’s career, particularly in
managing the family farm and his business affairs. Because of her, the Adamses avoided
the financial ruin that befell some other early presidents, such as Thomas Jefferson, after
they left office.

As the revolutionary spirit swept through the colonies, Abigail firmly supported the
movement for independence. In March 1776, when her husband prepared to gather with his
colleagues to write a statement of principles that would soon be adopted by the Continental
Congress as the Declaration of Independence, she asked him to “remember the ladies and
be more generous and favourable to them than your ancestors.” Although this letter has
often been cited, correctly, as evidence of her fervent desire for women’s rights, she did not
champion, then or later, the right of women to vote, a position virtually unheard of at the
time. She did, however, strongly support a woman’s right to education, and in 1778 she
wrote her husband that “you need not be told how much female education is neglected, nor
how fashionable it has been to ridicule female learning.” She also favoured the abolition of
slavery.
In 1784 Abigail joined her husband in Europe, when he began serving as American
minister to Britain. Her letters from Paris and London contain descriptive musings on
British royalty, French customs, and the superiority of the quiet life of an American farmer.
She wrote in early 1788 that she much preferred her “own little farm” to “the court of Saint
James’s where I seldom meet with characters so inoffensive as my Hens and chickings.”
Later that year the Adamses returned to the United States; when John assumed the vice
presidency in 1789, Abigail divided her time between the capital city (first New York City
and then, in 1790, Philadelphia) and the family home in Massachusetts. She missed her
husband’s presidential inauguration in March 1797 in order to care for his sick mother, and
during his presidency she often stayed in Massachusetts to look after family matters.
As first lady, she kept a rigorous daily schedule, rising at 5:00 AM to manage a busy
household and receive callers for two hours each day. Unlike Martha Washington, who had
been a gracious hostess but avoided all political discussions, Abigail involved herself in the
most interesting debates of the day. As the two major political factions, the Federalists and
the Anti-Federalists (later the Jeffersonian Republicans), developed into political parties in
the 1790s, she pointed out her husband’s friends and foes in both groups. About Alexander
Hamilton, who along with Adams was a leading Federalist, she wrote that she saw in his
eyes “the very devil…lasciviousness itself.” She judged Albert Gallatin, a Republican
opponent of her husband, “sly, artfull…insidious.” Her critics objected that the wife of the
president should not insinuate herself in political discussions; Gallatin wrote, “She is Mrs.
President not of the United States but of a faction.…It is not right.”
In November 1800, just as the election that denied John Adams a second term as president
was being held, Abigail oversaw the Adamses’ move from Philadelphia to the newly

constructed presidential mansion in Washington, D.C. Her letters to family members
showed her displeasure at finding the building roughly finished and unfurnished, but she
warned her daughter not to reveal her thoughts, since people would think her ungrateful.
On New Year’s Day 1801 she opened the mansion, soon to be known as the White House,
to visitors, continuing a tradition begun by the Washingtons and maintained by every
subsequent first lady until 1933.
After leaving office, Abigail and John retired to their home in Massachusetts. She
continued a lively correspondence with many people and even resumed writing to Thomas
Jefferson, from whom she had been estranged as a result of political differences. She died
in October 1818 and was buried in the First Church of Quincy; her husband, who died in
1826, was buried beside her.
Until the 20th century few first ladies shared Abigail Adams’s interest in politics or in the
treatment of government leaders by the press. She vigorously objected to what she
considered inaccurate reporting on her husband and son. But she was not altogether
surprised by the “lies [and] Falshoods,” writing in 1797 to her sister that she “expected to
be vilified and abused, with my whole family.” Although her approach to the office of first
lady was in many ways advanced, her fame rests primarily on her thousands of letters,
which form an eloquent and evocative description of her life and times.

But she was not altogether surprised by the “lies [and] Falshoods,” writing in 1797 to her sister that she “expected to be vilified and abused, with my whole family.” Although her approach to the office of first lady was in many ways advanced, her fame rests primarily on her thousands of letters, which form an eloquent and evocative description of her life and times.

Abraham Clark, (born Feb. 15, 1726, Elizabethtown (now Elizabeth), N.J. [U.S.]—died
Sept. 15, 1794, Elizabeth, N.J., U.S.), American patriot and signer of the Declaration of
Independence.
Though he had little formal education, Clark became a surveyor and managed transfers of
property. He had a gift for politics and served in many public offices in New Jersey,
including as sheriff of Essex county. He served in New Jersey’s colonial legislature in
1775–76, championing the cause of the colonies, and in 1776 was elected to the
Continental Congress, where he voted for separation from Great Britain and signed the
Declaration of Independence. He was reelected to the Continental Congress several times
and was also a delegate to the Annapolis Convention (1786). He was chosen to be a
delegate to the federal Constitutional Convention (1787) but was unable to attend, because
of illness. Clark opposed adoption of the new U.S. Constitution until he was assured that a
bill of rights would be added to it. He served in the U.S. House of Representatives from
1791 until his death.

Abu Bakar
Abu Bakar, (born 1830s?, Teluk Belanga, Singapore, Straits Settlements, British India
[now Telok Blangah district, Singapore]?—died June 4, 1895, London, England), sultan of
the Malay state of Johore (now part of Malaysia) from 1885 to 1895. He maintained
independence from Britain and stimulated economic development in Johore at a time when
most Southeast Asian states were being incorporated into European colonial empires.
Under an 1824 British treaty, supplemented by an agreement in 1855, the Malay state of
Johore was ruled not by the sultan but by a lower-ranking official called a temenggong.
These arrangements were in part an outgrowth of British machinations in acquiring
Singapore in 1819. Abu Bakar, who became temenggong in 1862, was the third ruler under
that agreement. He elevated his title to maharaja in 1868, and in 1885 he was
acknowledged by Great Britain as sultan of Johore, disestablishing the former sultan’s
lineage. An able and clever ruler, he did much to promote trade, investment, and agriculture
in his state. In particular he encouraged the development of gambier and pepper
plantations.
Western in his interests, Abu Bakar lived in the British colony of Singapore, and, in his
conduct of Johore’s internal affairs (Britain had control of Johore’s foreign affairs under
terms of an 1861 agreement), he made use of Western advisers and methods. This practice
stood him in good stead in persuading the British that the government of Johore was stable
and just. He also elicited British positions on important issues and established his own
policy accordingly, compromising when necessary. Thus, he not only maintained his
independence but also strengthened his position vis-à-vis other Malay rulers.

Abul Kalam Azad
Abul Kalam Azad, original name Abul Kalam Ghulam Muhiyuddin, also called
Maulana Abul Kalam Azad or Maulana Azad, (born November 11, 1888, Mecca [now in
Saudi Arabia]—died February 22, 1958, New Delhi, India), Islamic theologian who was
one of the leaders of the Indian independence movement against British rule in the first half
of the 20th century. He was highly respected throughout his life as a man of high moral
integrity.
Azad was the son of an Indian Muslim scholar living in Mecca and his Arabic wife. The
family moved back to India (Calcutta [now Kolkata]) when he was young, and he received
a traditional Islamic education at home from his father and other Islamic scholars rather
than at a madrasah (Islamic school). However, he was also influenced by the emphasis that
Indian educator Sir Sayyid Ahmad Khan placed on getting a well-rounded education, and
he learned English without his father’s knowledge.
Azad became active in journalism when he was in his late teens, and in 1912 he began
publishing a weekly Urdu-language newspaper in Calcutta, Al-Hilal (“The Crescent”). The
paper quickly became highly influential in the Muslim community for its anti-British
stance, notably for its criticism of Indian Muslims who were loyal to the British. Al-Hilal
was soon banned by British authorities, as was a second weekly newspaper that he had
started. By 1916 he had been banished to Ranchi (in present-day Jharkhand state), where he
remained until the beginning of 1920. Back in Calcutta, he joined the Indian National
Congress (Congress Party) and galvanized India’s Muslim community through an appeal to
pan-Islamic ideals. He was particularly active in the short-lived Khilafat movement (1920–
24), which defended the Ottoman sultan as the caliph (the head of the worldwide Muslim
community) and even briefly enlisted the support of Mohandas K. Gandhi.
Azad and Gandhi became close, and Azad was involved in Gandhi’s various civil-
disobedience (satyagraha) campaigns, including the Salt March (1930). He was imprisoned
several times between 1920 and 1945, including for his participation in the anti-British
Quit India campaign during World War II. Azad was president of the Congress Party in
1923 and again in 1940–46—though the party was largely inactive during much of his
second term, since nearly all of its leadership was in prison.
After the war Azad was one of the Indian leaders who negotiated for Indian independence
with the British. He tirelessly advocated for a single India that would embrace both Hindus

and Muslims while strongly opposing the partition of British India into independent India
and Pakistan. He later blamed both Congress Party leaders and Mohammed Ali Jinnah, the
founder of Pakistan, for the ultimate division of the subcontinent. After the two separate
countries were established, he served as minister of education in the Indian government of
Jawaharlal Nehru from 1947 until his death. His autobiography, India Wins Freedom, was
published posthumously in 1959. In 1992, decades after his death, Azad was awarded the
Bharat Ratna, India’s highest civilian award.

Adam Jerzy, Prince Czartoryski
Adam Jerzy, Prince Czartoryski, (born January 14,
1770, Warsaw, Pol.—died July 15, 1861,
Montfermeil, France), Polish statesman who worked
unceasingly for the restoration of Poland when
Russia, Prussia, and Austria had partitioned his
country’s former lands among themselves.
Czartoryski was the most renowned member of a
princely family, descended from the Lithuanian royal house, which wielded great power in
Poland in the 18th century. He received a thorough education in his native country and
traveled widely in western Europe. On returning to Poland in 1791, he played a
distinguished part in the anti-Russian 1792 campaign that precipitated the second partition
of Poland (1793). Although neither he nor his father took an active part in the 1794
insurrection that resulted in the third partition of Poland (1795), their palace at Puławy was
destroyed and the family estates confiscated.
Seeking the recovery of his property, Czartoryski went in 1795 to St. Petersburg, where he
joined the Russian government service and became friendly with the grand duke Alexander.
When Alexander became tsar, he called upon Czartoryski, who had become one of his
close advisers, to work on plans for the reform of the government, naming him deputy
minister of foreign affairs in 1802 and minister in 1804. Czartoryski’s hostility to Russia’s
alliance with Prussia and the Russian military defeat in the 1805 campaign against
Napoleon (undertaken against his advice), caused his dismissal in 1806; but he remained in
Russian service as curator (from 1803) of the educational region of Wilno (Vilnius), which
embraced the eastern provinces of the former Polish state.
After Napoleon’s downfall, Czartoryski resumed his efforts to restore Poland. With
Alexander’s consent, he was Poland’s spokesman at the Congress of Vienna in 1815,
obtaining as much as was possible—the creation of a new Kingdom of Poland with
Alexander as king. He helped to prepare a liberal constitution for the kingdom and became
a senator and member of the executive council, but in 1816, disillusioned with Alexander,
he largely withdrew from public life.
Czartoryski did not want a Polish rebellion against Russia and knew success would depend
more on Western diplomatic intervention than on fighting by the Poles, but he found

himself at the head of the Poles’ November Insurrection that broke out on Nov. 29, 1830.
On the collapse of the rebellion, sentenced to death by the Russians and deprived of his
estates, he went into exile on Aug. 15, 1831. His Paris residence, the Hôtel Lambert,
became the centre of the political activity of the Polish exiles. He was unofficially
acknowledged as “Polish king in exile” and maintained unofficial representatives in
Constantinople, Rome, and other European capitals. Czartoryski wrote his memoirs, in
addition to other literary and historical books and essays.

Adam Malik
Adam Malik, (born July 22, 1917, Pematangsiantar, North Sumatra, Dutch East Indies
[now Indonesia]—died Sept. 5, 1984, Jakarta, Indon.), Indonesian statesman and nationalist
political leader.
Malik was jailed by the Dutch in the 1930s for being a member of the nationalist group that
sought independence for the Dutch East Indies. In 1937 he founded the Indonesian news
agency Antara, which originally served as an organ of the nationalist press. During World
War II he was active in the Indonesian youth movement. In 1945 he was involved with the
abduction of the Indonesian leaders Sukarno and Mohammad Hatta in order to “force”
them to declare independence rather than receiving it as a gift from the Japanese, and in
1946 he was involved with the kidnapping of Sutan Sjahrir in order to protest a negotiated
settlement with the Dutch.
After the Indonesian revolution ended in 1949, Malik served in various posts of the
Sukarno government, including ambassador to the Soviet Union and to Poland. In 1962 he
was the chief Indonesian delegate to the Washington, D.C., negotiations on West Irian
(Irian Jaya), which laid the groundwork for Indonesia eventually securing this territory.
As foreign minister (1966–77) of the Suharto government, Malik was the architect of the
new Indonesian foreign policy that restored relations with Malaysia, the Philippines, and
China and regained the seat lost when Sukarno took Indonesia out of the UN in 1965.
Malik also was able to obtain a 30-year extension on the $3 billion debt to creditor nations
accumulated during the Sukarno years. As president of the United Nations 26th General
Assembly (1971–72), Malik presided over the admission of the People’s Republic of China
to the UN. Later he served as vice president of Indonesia (1978–83).

Afonso I
Afonso I, also called Afonso Henriques, byname
Afonso the Conqueror, Portuguese Afonso o
Conquistador, (born 1109/11, Guimarães, Port.—
died Dec. 6, 1185, Coimbra), the first king of Portugal
(1139–85), who conquered Santarém and Lisbon from
the Muslims (1147) and secured Portuguese
independence from Leon (1139).
Alfonso VI, emperor of Leon, had granted the county of Portugal to Afonso’s father, Henry
of Burgundy, who successfully defended it against the Muslims (1095–1112). Henry
married Alfonso VI’s illegitimate daughter, Teresa, who governed Portugal from the time of
her husband’s death (1112) until her son Afonso came of age. She refused to cede her
power to Afonso, but his party prevailed in the Battle of São Mamede, near Guimarães
(1128). Though at first obliged as a vassal to submit to his cousin Alfonso VII of Leon,
Afonso assumed the title of king in 1139.
By victory in the Battle of Ourique (1139) he was able to impose tribute on his Muslim
neighbours; and in 1147 he further captured Santarém and, availing himself of the services
of passing crusaders, successfully laid siege to Lisbon. He carried his frontiers beyond the
Tagus River, annexing Beja in 1162 and Évora in 1165; in attacking Badajoz, he was taken
prisoner but then released. He married Mafalda of Savoy and associated his son, Sancho I,
with his power. By the time of his death he had created a stable and independent monarchy.

Agostinho Neto
Agostinho Neto, in full António Agostinho Neto,
(born September 17, 1922, Icolo e Bengo, Angola—
died September 10, 1979, Moscow, Russia, U.S.S.R.),
Angolan poet, physician, and politician who served as
the first president (1975–79) of the People’s Republic
of Angola.
Neto first became known in 1948, when he published a volume of poems in Luanda and
joined a national cultural movement that was aimed at “rediscovering” indigenous Angolan
culture (similar to the Negritude movement of the French-speaking African countries). His
first of many arrests for political activities came shortly thereafter in Lisbon, where he had
gone to study medicine.
Neto returned home as a doctor in 1959 but was arrested in the presence of his patients in
June 1960 because of his militant opposition to the colonial authorities. When his patients
protested his arrest, the police opened fire, killing some and injuring 200. Neto spent the
next two years in detention in Cape Verde and in Portugal, where he produced a new
volume of verse. In 1962 he managed to escape to Morocco, where he joined the Angolan
liberation movement in exile. At the end of 1962 he was elected president of the
Movimento Popular de Libertação de Angola (MPLA).
When in 1975 Angola became independent, it was divided among its three warring
independence movements. The MPLA forces, however, with Cuban help, held the central
part of the country, including the capital, and Neto, a Marxist, was proclaimed president.
He served until his death in 1979.
Neto was widely recognized as a gifted poet. His work was published in a number of
Portuguese and Angolan reviews and was included in Mário de Andrade’s Antologia da
poesia negra de expressão portuguesa (1958).

Agostino Bertani
Agostino Bertani, (born Oct. 19, 1812, Milan—died April 10, 1886, Rome), physician
who collaborated with Mazzini and Garibaldi in the movement for Italian liberation.
Bertani took part in the March insurrection in Milan in 1848, organized an ambulance
service for the republicans during their defense of Rome in 1849, and distinguished himself
by his service in Genoa with Mazzini during the cholera epidemic of 1854. He was a
surgeon in Garibaldi’s corps in the Austro-Sardinian War of 1859. In 1860 he was one of
the strategists of the attack on Sicily and Naples known as the March of the Thousand. He
became Garibaldi’s secretary general after the occupation of Naples (September 1860), in
which office he reorganized the police and planned the suppression of the religious orders
and the sanitary reconstruction of the city. In 1862 he treated Garibaldi’s wounds received
at Aspromonte. In the war against Austria (1866), he organized the medical service for
Garibaldi’s 40,000, and in 1867, during Garibaldi’s march on Rome, he fought in the Battle
of Mentana although he was opposed to the campaign.
Entering the new Italian Parliament in 1861, Bertani became the leader of the chamber’s
extreme left. In 1866 he founded La Riforma, a journal advocating social reforms. When
the left came to power in 1876 with Premier Agostino Depretis, who introduced a system
known as transformism in which he built up his following by taking ministers from both
right and left, Bertani, hostile to the system, remained in opposition.

Agustín de Iturbide
Agustín de Iturbide
Agustín de Iturbide, also called (1822–23) Agustín
I, (born September 27, 1783, Valladolid, Viceroyalty
of New Spain [now Morelia, Mexico]—died July 19,
1824, Padilla, Mexico), Mexican caudillo (military
chieftain) who became the leader of the conservative
factions in the Mexican independence movement and,
as Agustín I, briefly emperor of Mexico.
Like many young men of the upper classes in Spanish America, Iturbide entered the
royalist army, becoming an officer in the provincial regiment of his native city in 1797. In
1810 Miguel Hidalgo y Costilla offered him a post with his revolutionary army, but
Iturbide refused and pledged himself to the Spanish cause instead. His defense of
Valladolid against the revolutionary forces of José María Morelos dealt a crushing blow to
the insurgents, and for this victory Iturbide was given command of the military district of
Guanajuato and Michoacán. In 1816, however, grave charges of extortion and violence
caused his removal.
By 1820 the radical independence movement was almost entirely extinguished. Both
Hidalgo and Morelos had been captured and executed; only guerrilla bands (under the
command of General Vicente Guerrero) prevented the complete victory of the royalists.
The Mexican independence movement then performed a curious about-face. In reaction to
a liberal coup d’état in Spain, the conservatives in Mexico (formerly staunch royalists)
advocated immediate independence. Iturbide assumed command of the army and, at Iguala,
allied his reactionary force with Guerrero’s radical insurgents. Iturbide’s Plan de Iguala,
published on February 24, 1821, proclaimed three guarantees: (1) immediate independence
from Spain, (2) equality for Spaniards and Creoles, and (3) the supremacy of Roman
Catholicism and a ban on all other religions. The Army of the Three Guarantees quickly
subjugated the country; on August 24, 1821, Juan O’Donojú, the new representative of the
Spanish king, signed the Treaty of Córdoba, recognizing the independence of Mexico.
The revolutionary coalition quickly fell apart as Iturbide removed Guerrero and his
insurgent following from influence. On May 19, 1822, Iturbide placed the crown upon his
own head and became Agustín I, emperor of Mexico. An arbitrary and extravagant ruler, he
proved unable to bring order and stability to his country, and all parties soon turned against
him. Opposition solidified behind Antonio López de Santa Anna, whose own plan called

for Iturbide’s overthrow and exile. On March 19, 1823, Iturbide abdicated and went first to
Italy and then to England. In 1824, however, he returned to Mexico, unaware that the
congress had decreed his death. Captured on July 15, he was executed four days later.
Although regarded by most scholars as a self-serving military adventurer, he has remained
for the Roman Catholic church and for the conservative classes the great hero of Mexican
independence.

Ahmadou Ahidjo
Ahmadou Ahidjo, (born August 1924, Garoua,
Cameroon—died Nov. 30, 1989, Dakar, Senegal),
first president of the United Republic of Cameroon,
who served from 1960 to 1982. He presided over one
of the few successful attempts at supraterritorial
African unity: the joining of the southern half of the
former British Cameroons with the larger, French-
speaking Cameroon.
Ahidjo was a Muslim from the northern part of Cameroon and served as a radio operator in
the French colonial administration from 1941/42 to 1953. He was elected to the Cameroon
territorial assembly in 1947 and reelected in 1952 and 1956. His early political career also
included several years in France (1953–56) as the Cameroon member of the Assembly of
the French Union. In the first Cameroon government (1957), he was vice premier and
minister of the interior; when the first premier fell in early 1958, he formed his own party,
the Cameroonian Union, and became the new premier.
Since 1956 the more radical, nationalist Union of the Populations of Cameroon, which
advocated immediate independence from France, had taken up arms against the French
administration. Ahidjo used French troops to put down the rebels, but he also offered
amnesty to those who would surrender. Many refused, however, and sporadic outbreaks of
violence haunted Ahidjo for years. His initial program included immediate internal
autonomy, a definite timetable for full independence, reunification with the British
Cameroons, and cooperation with the French. He was able to attain independence in 1960
and the unification with the southern British Cameroons in 1961, following a plebiscite.
In the elections held soon after independence, Ahidjo won by only a small majority but,
despite continuing small-scale violence, managed to build up a stable, relatively prosperous
country. After being elected five consecutive times for the presidency (in what became a
one-party state), he resigned on Nov. 6, 1982, claiming that he was suffering from
exhaustion. He was replaced by a Christian southerner, Paul Biya, who proceeded to oust
Ahidjo from chairmanship of the ruling party in 1983.
After 1983 Ahidjo lived in exile, and in 1984 he was, in absentia, condemned to death in
Cameroon for complicity in a plot against Biya. He never returned to Cameroon, dividing

Ahmed Ben Bella
Ahmed Ben Bella
Ahmed Ben Bella, (born December 25, 1916?,
Maghnia [Marnia], Algeria—died April 11, 2012,
Algiers), principal leader of the Algerian War of
Independence against France, the first prime minister
(1962–63) and first elected president (1963–65) of the
Algerian republic, who steered his country toward a
socialist economy.
Ben Bella was the son of a farmer and small businessman in Maghnia in the département of
Oran. There he successfully completed his early studies at the French school and continued
his education in the neighbouring city of Tlemcen, where he first became aware of racial
discrimination and also mingled with the fringes of the nationalist movement.
He was conscripted into the French army in 1937, served in World War II, and was
awarded the Croix de Guerre (1940) and the Médaille Militaire (1944). On his return to
Maghnia, Ben Bella resumed his nationalist activities, refusing to be intimidated by the
French authorities’ confiscation of his farm. He left Maghnia, joined Messali Hadj’s
underground movement, and soon became one of the “Young Turks” who, after the rigged
election of Gov. Marcel-Edmond Naegelen (1948), considered illusory any hope of
achieving independence democratically. With associates in Messali Hadj’s party, Ben Bella
founded the Organisation Spéciale, a paramilitary organization whose aim was to take up
arms as quickly as possible.
After robbing the post office at Oran (1950) to obtain funds for the nationalist movement,
Ben Bella was sentenced to prison, but he managed to escape after serving only two years
of his term. He went underground again and moved to Egypt, where he was promised help
by the revolutionary supporters of Gamal Abdel Nasser.
In November 1954 Ben Bella and the Algerian émigré leaders resident in Egypt, who had
met secretly in Switzerland with those leaders who were still living in Algeria, came to two
major decisions: to create the National Liberation Front (Front de Libération Nationale
[FLN]) and to order an armed insurrection against the French colonists.
Ben Bella played an important political role in the leadership of the FLN, simultaneously
organizing the shipment of foreign arms to Algeria. In 1956 he escaped two attempts on his

life, one at Cairo and the other at Tripoli, Libya. In the same year, he was arrested in
Algiers by the French military authorities while in the process of negotiating peace terms
with the French premier, Guy Mollet.
His imprisonment (1956–62) kept him dissociated from those errors of military conduct
committed by the FLN, and, when he was freed after the Évian agreements with France
were signed in 1962, his reputation was intact.
The situation in independent Algeria was chaotic. The leaders of the FLN had formed a
conservative provisional government (Provisional Government of the Algerian Republic),
while the party’s congress at Tripoli had elected a socialist-oriented government at the end
of the war. It was this latter “Bureau Politique” that Ben Bella ran.
The intervention on his behalf by Col. Houari Boumedienne, chief of the Army of National
Liberation (Armée de Libération Nationale [ALN]), assured both the success of the Bureau
Politique and of Ben Bella, who was elected unopposed and with an immense majority to
the presidency of the Algerian republic in 1963.
Ben Bella reestablished order in a country disorganized both by the massive departure of
French colonists and by the clashes of armed groups. He created a state out of nothing and
set aside one-quarter of the budget for national education. Above all else, he inaugurated,
under the title autogestion, a series of major agrarian reforms, including the nationalization
—but not the direct state control—of the former colonists’ huge farms.
Ben Bella allied himself with the anti-Zionist Arab states and developed cultural and
economic relations with France. He also extricated the country from an important border
dispute with Morocco.
Ben Bella’s method of government pleased the Algerian people, but the effects of his
policies were not always as beneficial as his generous intentions. Through lack of either
time, political lucidity, or planning, Ben Bella governed from day to day in a series of
improvised acts, some of which—like his appeal to Algerian women to donate their jewelry
to the state—were more spectacular than useful. Ben Bella was unable to restore the FLN,
nor was he able to win for it that popular support that would have helped to keep
Boumedienne in check.
On June 19, 1965, Ben Bella was deposed in a coup led by Boumedienne, who installed
himself as president; Ben Bella was detained and had little contact with the outside world

for 14 years. Following the death of Boumedienne in 1978, restrictions on Ben Bella were
eased in July 1979, though he remained under house arrest. On October 30, 1980, he was
freed. He spent 10 years in exile, returning to Algeria in 1990.
Ben Bella reentered the political arena soon after his return. He led the Movement for
Democracy in Algeria (Mouvement pour la Démocratie en Algérie), a moderate Islamist
opposition party he had founded in 1984 while in exile, in the first round of the country’s
abortive 1991 parliamentary elections (see Algeria: Civil war: the Islamists versus the
army). The party was among several banned in 1997.

Ahmed Messali Hadj, (born 1898, Tlemcen, Alg.—died June 3, 1974, Paris, France),
revolutionary Algerian nationalist leader.
Messali emerged in 1927 as the head of an Algerian workers’ association in Paris and spent
most of the rest of his life forming pro-independence organizations, agitating both in
France and Algeria, suffering imprisonment, and taking part in underground activities.
Messali’s first group, the Étoile Nord-Africaine (North African Star), was dissolved by the
French in 1929 after he called for revolt against their colonial rule. In the mid-1930s he
founded the Parti Populaire Algérien (PPA; Algerian Popular Party), which was suppressed
only to reemerge in 1946 as the Mouvement pour le Triomphe des Libertés Démocratiques
(MTLD; Movement for the Triumph of Democratic Liberties). His influence, however,
declined dramatically in the postwar period. In 1954 he formed the Mouvement National
Algérian (Algerian National Movement), but this organization was unable to compete with
the Front de Liberation Nationale (National Liberation Front), a rival party, which came to
lead the Algerian struggle for independence. He became politically isolated and spent his
final years in Paris.

Albert, Count Apponyi
Albert, Count Apponyi, (born May 29, 1846, Vienna
—died February 7, 1933, Geneva), Hungarian
statesman whose political philosophy blended the
conservative traditions of his background with
Hungarian nationalism.
Born into an ancient and famous family, he was the
son of Count György Apponyi, who was leader of the Progressive Conservatives and
chancellor from 1846 to 1848. Entering the Hungarian Parliament in 1872, Apponyi
remained a member of it, with one short exception, until 1918. From the late 1880s, he was
the leader of the “united opposition,” which consisted of all parties hostile to the Austro-
Hungarian “compromise” (Ausgleich) of 1867.
As minister of education (1906–10) in the coalition government, Apponyi introduced
changes in the school curricula that were greatly resented by the non-Magyars for their
Magyarizing tendencies. After the breakdown of the coalition he returned to the opposition
as a member of the Party of Independence, of which he became president after Ferenc
Kossuth’s death (1914). He was again minister of education in 1917–18.
Apponyi returned to Parliament after World War I and headed the Hungarian peace
delegation at Paris. He also represented Hungary several times at the League of Nations.
When he died in 1933 he was serving as Hungarian delegate to the disarmament
conference. His published works include several versions of his memoirs (Eng. trans.,
1935) and many studies on Hungarian constitutional problems. Apponyi was one of the
most brilliant orators in Hungarian public life.

Alessandro Poerio, (born August 27, 1802, Naples
[Italy]—died November 3, 1848, Venice), Italian
liberal during the Risorgimento, brother of Carlo
Poerio.
The son of Baron Giuseppe Poerio, a Neapolitan
lawyer well known for his own liberal sympathies,
Alessandro was taken into exile by his father on the Bourbon restoration in Naples in 1815.
He returned to Naples in 1818 and was able, in 1821, to enlist as a volunteer in the army;
he fought against the Austrians at Rieti. After the Austrian victory he again went with his
family into exile and traveled in Germany, where he became the friend of Goethe. He
began to write poetry, which was highly esteemed though its bulk was small because of his
perfectionism. His writings had great inspirational importance during the Risorgimento.
When the family was again allowed to come back to Naples (1833), Alessandro came with
them. In 1848 he again volunteered to fight the Austrians and died in Venice of wounds
received at Mestre.

Pétion, Alexandre Sabès
Alexandre Sabès Pétion
Alexandre Sabès Pétion, (born April 2, 1770, Port-
au-Prince, Haiti—died March 29, 1818, Port-au-
Prince), Haitian independence leader and president,
remembered by the Haitian people for his liberal rule
and by South Americans for his support of Simón
Bolívar during the struggle for independence from
Spain.
The son of a wealthy French colonist and a mulatto, Pétion served in the French colonial
army before the French Revolution and then joined the revolutionary troops of Toussaint
Louverture and, later, those of the mulatto general André Rigaud. Fleeing to France after
Toussaint defeated Rigaud, who had set up a mulatto state in the southern provinces, Pétion
returned in 1802 with the French army sent to reconquer the colony but then became one of
the first Haitian officers to revolt against France. In 1806 he was a leader in the revolt
against the rule of Jean-Jacques Dessalines, who had played a major role in 1803 in ousting
the French. When, after Dessalines’s death, Henry Christophe set up a separate state in
northern Haiti, Pétion was elected president of southern Haiti in 1807. He was re-elected in
1811 and made president for life in 1816.
Influenced by ideals of French liberalism, Pétion divided the large plantations into small
lots, giving one to each of his soldiers. Freed from the burden of producing a surplus for
the plantation owners, the people produced only enough for their own needs, and the
resulting slowdown in the economy led to galloping inflation. Pétion’s regime was also
marked by continual struggles with Christophe and with dissident generals in his own
country.

1923, Prague, Czechoslovakia), Czech statesman, one of
the founders and first finance minister of the Republic of

A leader of the Czech revolutionary organization Omladina, Rašín was arrested and
imprisoned for conspiring against the Austrian authorities after nationalistic rioting in
Prague in 1893. Granted amnesty in 1895, he joined the Young Czech Party and then
founded a new Radical-Progressive Party (1899); later, however, Rǎsín rejoined the Young
Czechs and became a close associate of the party’s leader, Karel Kramář. Rašín was elected
to the Austrian Reichsrat (lower house of parliament) in 1911; but, following the outbreak
of World War I, he was arrested (July 1915) and was sentenced to death for treason (June
1916). Given amnesty a year later, he was one of the home defense leaders who effected
the bloodless revolution at Prague (Oct. 28, 1918) that established a national republican
government. As first finance minister of the fledgling Czechoslovak republic, Rǎsín
managed partially to check postwar inflation. In January 1923 he was shot by a Communist
revolutionary and subsequently died of his wounds.

Aléxandros Mavrokordátos, (born Feb. 11, 1791,
Constantinople [now Istanbul, Tur.]—died Aug. 18,
1865, Aegina, Greece), statesman, one of the founders
and first political leaders of independent Greece.
The scion of a Greek Phanariot house (living in the
Greek quarter of Constantinople) long distinguished in the Turkish imperial service,
Mavrokordátos was secretary (1812–17) to Ioannis Karadja, hospodar (prince) of Walachia
(now in Romania), and later went into exile with his master. In 1821, however,
Mavrokordátos joined the revolutionaries in Greece who had just rebelled against the
Turks; despite their suspicions of his Phanariot origins, he soon established himself as head
of a regional government at Missolonghi, in western Greece. During December 1821–
January 1822 he presided over the first National Assembly, at Epidaurus, and led in the
drafting of a constitution.
Mavrokordátos was elected first president of the Hellenic republic, but the new government
exercised little actual power, and he soon returned to Missolonghi, where he conducted a
successful defense against the Turks (November 1822–January 1823). He represented the
national government as governor-general (1823–25) at Missolonghi, receiving there Lord
Byron, the famous English poet-partisan of the Greek cause. He later became the principal
leader of the pro-English party, though he did not approve of the Greek demand for British
protection (June–July 1825).
Ignored during the presidency of the Russophile Count Ioánnis Kapodístrias (1827–31),
Mavrokordátos was appointed minister of finance (1832) and then prime minister (1833)
under Greece’s first king, Otto. He later served as Greek envoy in Munich, Berlin, London,
and finally Constantinople. Recalled from London by the king in February 1841 to head the
foreign ministry, Mavrokordátos was soon charged with the formation of a government
with himself as minister of the interior (July 1841); but his reformist administration quickly
foundered in the face of royal absolutism, and on Aug. 20, 1841, he was forced to resign.
After the revolution of 1843 he was again prime minister (1844, 1854–55).

Amin al-Husseini
Amin al-Husseini
Amin al-Husseini, also called al-Hajj Amin or Hajj
Amin, in full Muḥammad Amīn Ṭāhir Muṣṭafā al-
Ḥusayni, (born 1897, Jerusalem, Palestine, Ottoman
Empire—died July 4, 1974, Beirut, Lebanon), grand
mufti of Jerusalem and Arab nationalist figure who
played a major role in Arab resistance to Zionist
political ambitions in Palestine.
Husseini studied in Jerusalem, Cairo, and Istanbul, and in 1910 he was commissioned in
the Ottoman artillery. In December 1921 the British, who had accepted a mandate for
Palestine after World War I (1914–18), named Husseini grand mufti of Jerusalem and
president of the newly created Supreme Muslim Council—the most authoritative religious
body in the Palestinian Muslim community.
Husseini came to dominate the Palestinian Arab
movement after a bitter clash with other nationalist
elements, notably the Nashāshībī family, over
personal rather than ideological differences. During
most of the period of the British mandate,
disagreement between these groups seriously
weakened the effectiveness of Arab efforts. In 1936
they achieved a measure of unity when all the Palestinian groups joined to create a
permanent executive organ known as the Arab Higher Committee, under Husseini’s
chairmanship. The committee demanded a cessation of Jewish immigration and a
prohibition of land transfers from Arabs to Jews. A general strike developed into a rebellion
against British authority. The British removed Husseini from the council presidency and
declared the committee illegal in Palestine. In October 1937 he fled to Lebanon, where he
reconstituted the committee under his domination. Husseini retained the allegiance of most
Palestinian Arabs, using his power to punish the Nashāshībīs.
The rebellion forced Britain to make substantial concessions to Arab demands in 1939. The
British abandoned the idea of establishing Palestine as a Jewish state, and, while Jewish
immigration was to continue for another five years, it was thereafter to depend on Arab
consent. Husseini, however, felt that the concessions did not go far enough, and he
repudiated the new policy.

Husseini spent most of World War II (1939–45) in Germany, where he issued broadcasts
urging revolt in the Arab world and endeavoured to halt Jewish emigration to Palestine
from countries occupied by the Nazis. At the war’s end he fled to Egypt, where he directed
an increasingly weak and fragmented Arab Higher Committee from exile.

Amílcar Lopes Cabral
Amílcar Lopes Cabral, (born September 12, 1924, Bafatá, Portuguese Guinea [now
Guinea-Bissau]—died January 20, 1973, Conakry, Guinea), agronomist, nationalist leader,
and founder and secretary-general of the African Party for the Independence of Guinea and
Cape Verde (Partido Africano da Independência da Guiné e Cabo Verde; PAIGC), who
helped lead Guinea-Bissau to independence. He was a leading African thinker of the 20th
century.
After receiving his early education in Cape Verde, Cabral pursued university studies in
Lisbon, where he helped to found the Centro de Estudos Africanos, an association of
Lusophone African students that included future Angolan president Agostinho Neto. While
in Lisbon, Cabral and some of his fellow African students developed political theories
regarding colonialism and liberation. After graduating in 1950, Cabral was employed by
the Portuguese colonial authorities as an agronomist. In the early 1950s he traveled widely
in Portuguese Guinea in order to conduct a survey of the land and its resources, which
provided him with the opportunity to interact with people from various cultures who lived
in the colony. During that time Cabral also continued to contemplate national liberation for
colonies in Africa. In September 1956 he and five associates—including a brother, Luís,
and Aristides Pereira—formed the PAIGC, and in December of that year he cofounded a
liberation movement in Angola with Neto.
Cabral rapidly emerged as the leader of the PAIGC. The group organized early political
resistance to colonial power in the form of workers’ strikes—calling for better wages and
improved conditions. However, the Pidjiguiti Massacre in August 1959, when the
Portuguese fired on demonstrators during a dockworkers’ strike, demonstrated to the
PAIGC that a different approach was needed. Resistance activity was subsequently shifted
to the countryside and was altered to make use of guerrilla-style tactics.
Beginning in 1963, Cabral took his party into an open war for the independence of
Portuguese Guinea, and in the late 1960s Cabral was the de facto ruler of the parts of
Portuguese Guinea not occupied by army units from Portugal. In 1972 he established the
Guinean People’s National Assembly as a step toward independence. In January 1973
Cabral was shot outside his home in Conakry in neighbouring independent Guinea, where
his party had established its headquarters. He was killed by Inocêncio Kani, a disgruntled
PAIGC guerrilla war veteran who was believed to have been working with Portuguese
agents. In September of that year the PAIGC unilaterally declared Guinea-Bissau’s

independence, a status formally achieved on September 10, 1974, with Cabral’s brother
Luís as the new country’s first president.
Cabral’s efforts in the guerrilla war against the Portuguese military were matched by his
contributions to the literature of national liberation. Cabral’s main contribution was his
study of colonized identity and leadership in the context of national liberation, class
consciousness, and Marxian theory. For Cabral, culture was key to national liberation. He
articulated a process of “re-Africanization,” by which Africa’s elite, long beholden to the
colonizers for their education and employment, would re-embrace indigenous African
culture and reintegrate themselves into mass popular culture. Only by doing so could
Africa’s indigenous leaders re-create an independent identity—socially, culturally, and
psychologically—and rally a nationalist spirit in the rural peasantry, whose lives had
largely been untouched by imperialism. Colonized people could then regain control over
their lives, “reenter history,” and retap their “national productive forces.” This movement
he called “Returning to the Source.” With his emphasis on national consciousness and
indigenous development, Cabral’s views remain relevant to contemporary discussions of
African underdevelopment and the limits of postcolonial governments across the continent.
Many of Cabral’s speeches and writings were collected in Revolution in Guinea: Selected
Texts (1969), Return to the Source: Selected Speeches of Amílcar Cabral (1973), and Unity
and Struggle: Speeches and Writings (1979; 2nd ed., 2008).

Amānullāh Khan
Amānullāh Khan
Amānullāh Khan, (born June 1, 1892, Paghmān,
Afghanistan—died April 25, 1960, Zürich,
Switzerland), ruler of Afghanistan (1919–29) who led
his country to full independence from British
influence.
A favoured son of the Afghan ruler Ḥabībullāh Khan,
Amānullāh took possession of the throne immediately after his father’s assassination in
1919, at a time when Great Britain exercised an important influence on Afghan affairs. In
his coronation address Amānullāh declared total independence from Great Britain. This led
to war with the British (see Anglo-Afghan Wars), but fighting was confined to a series of
skirmishes between an ineffective Afghan army and a British Indian army exhausted from
the heavy demands of World War I (1914–18). A peace treaty recognizing the independence
of Afghanistan was signed at Rawalpindi (now in Pakistan) in August 1919.
Although a charming man and a sincere patriot and reformer, Amānullāh was also
impulsive and tactless and tended to surround himself with poor advisers. Shortly after
ascending the throne, he pushed for a series of Western-style reforms, including an
education program and road-building projects, but was opposed by reactionaries. In 1928
he returned from a trip to Europe with plans for legislative reform and emancipation of
women, proposals that caused his popular support to drop and enraged the mullahs
(Muslim religious leaders). In 1928 a tribal revolt resulted in a chaotic situation during
which a notorious bandit leader, Bacheh Saqqāw (Bacheh-ye Saqqā; “Child of a Water
Carrier”), seized Kabul, the capital city, and declared himself ruler. Amānullāh attempted to
regain the throne but, for reasons that are unclear, failed to do so. He abdicated in January
1929 and left Afghanistan for permanent exile that May.

off Modon, Cape Matapan, Suda, and Cape Papas. After the war he led a faction of the
influential pro-English party; later his opposition to the pro-Russian president of Greece,
Ioánnis Kapodístrias, and support for the antigovernment rebels of the isle of Hydra moved
him to seize the government naval arsenal at Poros (July 27, 1831) and burn the

Andres Bonifacio
Andres Bonifacio, (born Nov. 30, 1863, Manila—died May 10, 1897, Mt. Buntis, Phil.),
Philippine patriot, founder and leader of the nationalist Katipunan society, who instigated
the revolt of August 1896 against the Spanish.
Bonifacio was born of poor parents in Manila and had little formal education, working as a
messenger and warehouse keeper before becoming involved in revolutionary activity. He
was, however, well-read. Unlike the nationalist poet and novelist José Rizal, who wanted to
reform Spanish rule in the Philippines, Bonifacio advocated complete independence from
Spain. In 1892 he founded the Katipunan in Manila, modelling its organization and
ceremony on that of the Masonic order. The Katipunan at first grew slowly, but by 1896 it
had an estimated 100,000 members and branches not only in Manila but also in central
Luzon and on the islands of Panay, Mindoro, and Mindanao. Its members were mostly
workers and peasants; the urban middle class supported reform rather than revolution.
In August 1896 Bonifacio led the long-planned insurrection on Luzon; but his forces were
defeated by Spanish troops, and he was forced to retreat to Montalban in the north, while
Emilio Aguinaldo, one of his lieutenants, carried on resistance. As the Spanish
systematically routed the insurrectos, it became increasingly clear that Bonifacio was an
ineffective military leader. In March 1897 a convention at Tejeros named Aguinaldo, rather
than Bonifacio, president of a new Philippine republic. Refusing to recognize the
convention, Bonifacio tried to establish his own rebel government. In April 1897 Aguinaldo
had Bonifacio arrested and tried for treason; he was executed by a firing squad.

London, Eng.—died Sept. 20, 1933, Adyar, Madras
[now in Tamil Nādu, India]), British social reformer,
sometime Fabian socialist, theosophist, and Indian
independence leader.
Besant had been the wife of an Anglican clergyman.
They separated in 1873, and Besant became associated for many years with the atheist and
social reformer Charles Bradlaugh. She was an early advocate of birth control, and in the
late 1880s she became a prominent Fabian socialist under the influence of George Bernard
Shaw. Finally, in 1889, she was converted to the doctrines of the Russian-born religious
mystic Helena Blavatsky, a cofounder of the Theosophical Society. The teachings of the
society emphasized human service, a spiritual evolutionism drawn from both Eastern and
Western esoteric philosophy, and the role of suprahuman masters of wisdom. Besant
plunged vigorously into theosophical work, lecturing and writing widely. Her numerous
books and articles are still considered among the best expositions of theosophical belief.
She was international president of the Theosophical Society from 1907 until her death,
residing principally at its headquarters in Madras. She was active in educational and
humanitarian work in India and became involved in the Indian independence movement,
establishing the Indian Home Rule League in 1916. She promoted her protégé, Jiddu
Krishnamurti, whom she believed to be a potential world teacher, in the years before his
renunciation of formal theosophy in 1929.

Antonio José de Sucre
Antonio José de Sucre, in full Antonio José de
Sucre Alcalá, (born February 3, 1795, Cumaná, New
Granada [now in Venezuela]—died June 4, 1830,
Berruecos, Gran Colombia [now in Colombia]),
liberator of Ecuador and Peru, and one of the most
respected leaders of the Latin American wars for
independence from Spain. He served as Simón
Bolívar’s chief lieutenant and eventually became the first constitutionally elected leader of
Bolivia.
At the age of 15 Sucre entered the struggles for independence in Venezuela and Colombia.
He displayed great skill at military tactics, and by 1820 he had become chief of staff to the
Venezuelan leader of Latin American revolt against Spanish rule, Simón Bolívar. That same
year he was promoted by Bolívar to the rank of general and assigned to free southern Gran
Colombia (now Ecuador) from Spanish control. Leaving Colombia with a small army,
Sucre marched along the coast to Guayaquil and proclaimed it a protectorate of Colombia.
Then he marched to Quito, 10,000 feet (3,000 metres) above sea level, where he defeated
Spanish royalist forces on May 24, 1822, at the Battle of Pichincha. Proceeding southeast,
he joined his army with that of Bolívar to form a force of about 9,000 men that won the
Battle of Junín in Peru on August 6, 1824. Bolívar left the rest of the campaign in the hands
of Sucre, who went on to rout a 9,000-man royalist army at the Battle of Ayacucho in Peru
on December 9. This victory effectively assured the independence of Peru. A few
insubordinates still held Charcas in Upper Peru (now Bolivia); early in 1825 Bolívar
ordered Sucre to dislodge them, which he did.
Sucre then set up a Bolivian government under a complicated constitution written by
Bolívar, with Sucre as president. He tried to rebuild the economy of war-torn Bolivia and
embarked on progressive social and economic reforms, such as the expropriation of most of
the Roman Catholic Church’s assets in order to fund a new system of public secondary
schools. Sucre soon became the target of opposition from Bolivia’s entrenched traditional
elites, and a local uprising at Chuquisaca in 1828 and an invasion by Peruvian troops
caused him to resign the presidency in April of that year and retire to Ecuador. He was
called, however, to defend Gran Colombia against the Peruvians, whom he defeated in
1829. He was called again the following year to preside over the “Admirable Congress” in

Venezuela. While returning home, Sucre was assassinated. The assassins were rumoured to
be agents of José María Obando, a Colombian soldier and opponent of Bolívar, but no
proof was ever found.

Apolinario Mabini
Apolinario Mabini, (born July 23, 1864, Talaga, Phil.—died May 13, 1903, Manila),
Filipino theoretician and spokesman of the Philippine Revolution, who wrote the
constitution for the short-lived republic of 1898–99.
Born into a peasant family, Mabini studied at San Juan de Letran College in Manila and
won a law degree from the University of Santo Tomás in 1894. In an insurrection organized
in August 1896 by nationalists, he joined the forces of the patriot general Emilio Aguinaldo
and soon became his right-hand man. When the Spanish–American War broke out in 1898,
Mabini urged cooperation with the United States as a means to gain freedom from Spain.
At a convention held at the market town of Malolos in September and October 1898, an
independent republic was proclaimed with Aguinaldo as its president; Mabini drew up its
constitution, which resembled that of the United States. When the United States
announced, however, that it would annex the Philippines, Mabini joined Aguinaldo in a
renewed struggle for independence. He was captured by U.S. troops in December 1899
and, because he refused to swear allegiance to the United States, was exiled to Guam, not
being allowed to return home until a few months before his death. Mabini wrote La
revolución filipina, which was published in 1931.

Arthur Griffith
Arthur Griffith, (born March 31, 1871, Dublin, Ire.
—died Aug. 12, 1922, Dublin), journalist and Irish
nationalist, principal founder of the powerful Sinn
Féin (“We Ourselves” or “Ourselves Alone”)
movement, and acting president of Dáil Éireann (Irish
Assembly) (1919–20) and its president from Jan. 10,
1922, until his death.
After working as a typesetter in Dublin and then as a miner and journalist in South Africa
(1896–98), Griffith edited political newspapers such as The United Irishman, Sinn Féin,
Eire, and Nationality and spent his life in near poverty. Griffith sought to divert the Irish
from their attempt to win self-government through legislative action in the British House of
Commons. Instead, he urged passive resistance as the way to achieve Irish Home Rule. The
Irish were to refuse to pay British taxes, while Irish members of the Commons were to stay
away from Westminster and to sit in Ireland as a national assembly. At a meeting in Dublin
(October 1902), Cumann na nGaedheal (“Party of the Irish”) announced this policy, which
was called Sinn Féin. By 1905 the name had been transferred from the policy to its
adherents.
Angered by the suggestion that Ireland be partitioned (which he was later constrained to
accept), Griffith attacked the unsuccessful third Irish Home Rule Bill (1912–14). When the
formation of the Ulster Volunteers, who supported the Anglo-Irish union, threatened to lead
to violence, he aided the counterorganization of the Irish Volunteers. From the beginning of
World War I, he opposed Irish participation in the British war effort.
Taking no part in the Easter Rising in Dublin (1916), Griffith lost influence with the
extreme nationalists. But he was supportive of the Rising and recovered his reputation
when the British authorities incarcerated him in Reading Gaol (May–December 1916).
Returning to newspaper work, Griffith was jailed twice more for his anti-British
journalism.
After their electoral victory in December 1918, the Sinn Féin members of the House of
Commons met as Dáil Éireann, with Eamon de Valera as president and Griffith as vice
president. During de Valera’s long absence (in North America 1919–20), Griffith acted as
head of the Dáil ministry and carried out his own program of civil disobedience.

In the fall of 1921 Griffith unwillingly went to London as the leader of the Irish delegation
to the self-government treaty conference. He was the first Irish delegate to accept the
British terms, later embodied in the Anglo-Irish Treaty (Dec. 6, 1921), under which the
Irish Free State came into existence as a self-governing dominion in the British
Commonwealth a year later. Though not satisfied, Griffith insisted that the treaty offered
Ireland the best possible opportunity to advance toward full freedom.
When the Dáil narrowly approved the treaty (Jan. 8, 1922), de Valera resigned, and Griffith
was elected its president. He was not, however, the head of the provisional government of
1922 established to implement the treaty; Michael Collins had been awarded its
chairmanship. Although the two men greatly respected each other, their official actions and
utterances were frequently irreconcilable. Opposition to the treaty led to the outbreak of
civil war in Ireland (June 28, 1922). Exhausted from overwork, Griffith died soon
afterward.

During de Valera’s long absence (in North America 1919–20), Griffith acted as head of the Dáil ministry and carried out his own program of civil disobedience. Arthur Griffith   In the fall of 1921 Griffith unwillingly went to London as the leader of the Irish delegation to the self-government treaty conference. He was the first Irish delegate to accept the British terms, later embodied in the Anglo-Irish Treaty (Dec. 6, 1921), under which the Irish Free State came into existence as a self-governing dominion in the British Commonwealth a year later. Though not satisfied, Griffith insisted that the treaty offered Ireland the best possible opportunity to advance toward full freedom. When the Dáil narrowly approved the treaty (Jan. 8, 1922), de Valera resigned, and Griffith was elected its president. He was not, however, the head of the provisional government of 1922 established to implement the treaty; Michael Collins had been awarded its chairmanship. Although the two men greatly respected each other, their official actions and utterances were frequently irreconcilable. Opposition to the treaty led to the outbreak of civil war in Ireland (June 28, 1922). Exhausted from overwork, Griffith died soon afterward.

Artúr Görgey
Artúr Görgey, (born Jan. 30, 1818, Toporcz, Hung.,
Austrian Empire [now in Slovakia]—died May 20,
1916, Budapest, Hung., Austria-Hungary), Hungarian
army officer famous for his role in the Revolution of
1848–49.
Görgey served as a youth in the Austrian army but left
it to study chemistry. Later, when Hungarian patriots raised a national army in 1848, he
joined it and soon won a reputation for valour and leadership. After commanding a corps in
the attempt to relieve Vienna on Oct. 30, 1848, he was placed in command of the
Hungarian forces on the upper Danube River. Austrian armies invaded Hungary in
December, but Görgey, recognizing the rawness of his troops, withdrew and refused to
defend Budapest. The tension that decision created between him and the nationalist leader
Lajos Kossuth was increased when on Jan. 5, 1849, Görgey issued an order to his troops
that read like a defiance of the authority of the committee of national defense. Later,
however, his brilliant spring offensive nearly drove the Austrians from Hungary.
After Hungary’s declaration of independence (April 14), Görgey agreed to merge his
command with the post of minister of defense, although his disapproval of the
dethronement of the Habsburgs was no secret. He refused suggestions to move his armies
to the western frontier, proclaim himself military dictator, and make peace with the
Austrians before the expected Russian invasion occurred.
Instead Görgey fought on with great skill and courage against increasing odds. On August
11, however, with Hungary’s situation hopeless, Kossuth abdicated as governor in favour of
Görgey, who capitulated to the Russians at Világos two days later.
Only the personal intervention of the Russian emperor Nicholas I spared Görgey from
execution. Interned in Klagenfurt, Austria, he was allowed to return to Hungary in 1867.
Accusations of treason against him brought by Kossuth and his followers were proved false
by documents published in 1918. Although Görgey viewed many actions of Hungarian
extremists as foolish and wrong, he sacrificed his own feelings to what he regarded as the
higher interest. Görgey defended his own actions in Mein Leben und Wirken in Ungarn,

Aung San
Aung San
Aung San, (born Feb. 13, 1915, Natmauk, Burma
[now Myanmar]—died July 19, 1947, Rangoon [now
Yangon]), Burmese nationalist leader and
assassinated hero who was instrumental in securing
Burma’s independence from Great Britain. Before
World War II Aung San was actively anti-British; he
then allied with the Japanese during World War II, but
switched to the Allies before leading the Burmese drive for autonomy.
Born of a family distinguished in the resistance movement after the British annexation of
1886, Aung San became secretary of the students’ union at Rangoon University and, with U
Nu, led the students’ strike there in February 1936. After Burma’s separation from India in
1937 and his graduation in 1938, he worked for the nationalist Dobama Asiayone (“We-
Burmans Association” or “Our Burma Association”), becoming its secretary-general in
1939.
While seeking foreign support for Burma’s independence in 1940, Aung San was contacted
in China by the Japanese. They then assisted him in raising a Burmese military force to aid
them in their 1942 invasion of Burma. Known as the “Burma Independence Army,” it grew
with the advance of the Japanese and tended to take over the local administration of
occupied areas. Serving as minister of defense in Ba Maw’s puppet government (1943–45),
Aung San became skeptical of Japanese promises of Burmese independence, even if an
unlikely Japanese victory were to occur, and was displeased with their treatment of
Burmese forces. Thus, in March 1945, Major General Aung San switched his Burma
National Army to the Allied cause.
After the Japanese surrender in August 1945, the British sought to incorporate his forces
into the regular army, but he held key members back, forming the People’s Volunteer
Organization. This was ostensibly a veterans’ association interested in social service, but it
was in fact a private political army designed to take the place of his Burma National Army
and to be used as a major weapon in the struggle for independence.
Having helped form the Anti-Fascist People’s Freedom League (AFPFL), an underground
movement of nationalists, in 1944, Aung San used that united front to become deputy
chairman of Burma’s Executive Council in late 1946. In effect he was prime minister but

remained subject to the British governor’s veto. After conferring with the British prime
minister Clement Attlee in London, he announced an agreement (Jan. 27, 1947) that
provided for Burma’s independence within one year. In the election for a constitutional
assembly in April 1947, his AFPFL won 196 of 202 seats. Though communists had
denounced him as a “tool of British imperialism,” he supported a resolution for Burmese
independence outside the British Commonwealth.
On July 19, the prime minister and six colleagues, including his brother, were assassinated
in the council chamber in Rangoon while the executive council was in session. His political
rival, U Saw, interned in Uganda during the war, was later executed for his part in the
killings.

Jāladat, like his elder brother Surayyā, devoted his life to the cause of establishing a unified

1927 he was appointed the first president of the Khoybun (Kurdish National League) and
three years later participated in the unsuccessful Kurdish rebellion in Turkey. He became
the first editor (May 1932) of the bilingual Kurdish–French review Ḥawār (“Summons”),
which, together with his later illustrated publication Runahi (“Light”), promoted
understanding among the diverse and often conflicting elements of the Kurdish nationalist
movement and contributed to the growth of a Kurdish popular literature.

Bal Gangadhar Tilak
Bal Gangadhar Tilak
Bal Gangadhar Tilak, byname Lokamanya, (born
July 23, 1856, Ratnagiri [now in Maharashtra state],
India—died August 1, 1920, Bombay [now
Mumbai]), scholar, mathematician, philosopher, and
ardent nationalist who helped lay the foundation for
India’s independence by building his own defiance of
British rule into a national movement. He founded
(1914) and served as president of the Indian Home Rule League. In 1916 he concluded the
Lucknow Pact with Mohammed Ali Jinnah, which provided for Hindu-Muslim unity in the
nationalist struggle.
Early life and career
Tilak was born into a cultured middle-class Brahman family. Although his birth place was
Bombay (Mumbai), he was raised in a village along the Arabian Sea coast in what is now
Maharashtra state until the age of 10, when his father, an educator and noted grammarian,
took a job in Poona (now Pune). The young Tilak was educated at Deccan College in
Poona, where in 1876,he earned bachelor’s degrees in mathematics and Sanskrit. Tilak then
studied law, receiving his degree in 1879 from the University of Bombay (now Mumbai).
At that point, however, he decided to teach mathematics in a private school in Poona. The
school became the basis for his political career. He developed the institution into a
university college after founding the Deccan Education Society (1884), which aimed at
educating the masses, especially in the English language; he and his associates considered
English to be a powerful force for the dissemination of liberal and democratic ideals.
The life members of the society were expected to follow an ideal of selfless service, but
when Tilak learned that some members were keeping outside earnings for themselves, he
resigned. He then turned to the task of awakening the political consciousness of the people
through two weekly newspapers that he owned and edited: Kesari (“The Lion”), published
in Marathi, and The Mahratta, published in English. Through those newspapers Tilak
became widely known for his bitter criticisms of British rule and of those moderate
nationalists who advocated social reforms along Western lines and political reforms along
constitutional lines. He thought that social reform would only divert energy away from the
political struggle for independence.

Bal Gangadhar Tilak
Tilak sought to widen the popularity of the nationalist movement (which at that time was
largely confined to the upper classes) by introducing Hindu religious symbolism and by
invoking popular traditions of the Maratha struggle against Muslim rule. He thus organized
two important festivals, Ganesh in 1893 and Shivaji in 1895. Ganesha is the elephant-
headed god worshipped by all Hindus, and Shivaji, the first Hindu hero to fight against
Muslim power in India, was the founder of the Maratha state in the 17th century, which in
the course of time overthrew Muslim power in India. But, though that symbolism made the
nationalist movement more popular, it also made it more communal and thus alarmed the
Muslims.
Rise to national prominence
Tilak’s activities aroused the Indian populace, but
they soon also brought him into conflict with the
British government, which prosecuted him for
sedition and sent him to jail in 1897. The trial and
sentence earned him the title Lokamanya (“Beloved
Leader of the People”). He was released after 18
months.
When Lord Curzon, viceroy of India, partitioned Bengal in 1905, Tilak strongly supported
the Bengali demand for the annulment of the partition and advocated a boycott of British
goods, which soon became a movement that swept the nation. The following year he set
forth a program of passive resistance, known as the Tenets of the New Party, that he hoped
would destroy the hypnotic influence of British rule and prepare the people for sacrifice in
order to gain independence. Those forms of political action initiated by Tilak—the
boycotting of goods and passive resistance—were later adopted by Mohandas (Mahatma)
Gandhi in his program of nonviolent noncooperation with the British (satyagraha).
Tilak’s approach was strong fare for the moderate Indian National Congress (Congress
Party), which believed in making “loyal” representations to the government for small
reforms. Tilak aimed at swarajya (independence), not piecemeal reforms, and attempted to
persuade the Congress Party to adopt his militant program. On that issue, he clashed with
the moderates during the party’s session (meeting) at Surat (now in Gujarat state) in 1907,
and the party split. Taking advantage of the division in the nationalist forces, the
government again prosecuted Tilak on a charge of sedition and inciting terrorism and
deported him to Mandalay, Burma (Myanmar), to serve a six-year prison sentence.

In the Mandalay jail, Tilak settled down to write his magnum opus, the Śrīmad
Bhagavadgitā Rahasya (“Secret of the Bhagavadgita”)—also known as Bhagavad Gita or
Gita Rahasya—an original exposition of the most-sacred book of the Hindus. Tilak
discarded the orthodox interpretation that the Bhagavadgita (a component of the
Mahabharata epic poem) taught the ideal of renunciation; in his view it taught selfless
service to humanity. Earlier, in 1893, he had published The Orion; or, Researches into the
Antiquity of the Vedas, and, a decade later, The Arctic Home in the Vedas. Both works were
intended to promote Hindu culture as the successor to the Vedic religion and his belief that
its roots were in the so-called Aryans from the north.
On his release in 1914, on the eve of World War I, Tilak once more plunged into politics.
He launched the Home Rule League with the rousing slogan “Swarajya is my birthright and
I will have it.” (Activist Annie Besant also established an organization with the same name
at about that time.) In 1916 he rejoined the Congress Party and signed the historic Lucknow
Pact, a Hindu-Muslim accord, with Mohammed Ali Jinnah, the future founder of Pakistan.
Tilak visited England in 1918 as president of the Indian Home Rule League. He realized
that the Labour Party was a growing force in British politics, and he established firm
relationships with its leaders. His foresight was justified: it was a Labour government that
granted independence to India in 1947. Tilak was one of the first to maintain that Indians
should cease to cooperate with foreign rule, but he always denied that he had ever
encouraged the use of violence.
By the time Tilak returned home in late 1919 to attend the meeting of the Congress Party at
Amritsar, he had mellowed sufficiently to oppose Gandhi’s policy of boycotting the
elections to the legislative councils established as part of the reforms that followed from the
Montagu-Chelmsford Report to Parliament in 1918. Instead, Tilak advised the delegates to
follow his policy of “responsive cooperation” in carrying out the reforms, which introduced
a certain degree of Indian participation in regional government. He died, however, before
he could give the new reforms a decisive direction. In tributes, Gandhi called him “the
Maker of Modern India,” and Jawaharlal Nehru, independent India’s first prime minister,
described him as “the Father of the Indian Revolution.”

He founded (1914) and served as president of the Indian Home Rule League. In 1916 he concluded the Lucknow Pact with Mohammed Ali Jinnah, which provided for Hindu-Muslim unity in the nationalist struggle. Early life and career Tilak was born into a cultured middle-class Brahman family. Although his birth place was Bombay (Mumbai), he was raised in a village along the Arabian Sea coast in what is now Maharashtra state until the age of 10, when his father, an educator and noted grammarian, took a job in Poona (now Pune). The young Tilak was educated at Deccan College in Poona, where in 1876,he earned bachelor’s degrees in mathematics and Sanskrit. Tilak then studied law, receiving his degree in 1879 from the University of Bombay (now Mumbai). At that point, however, he decided to teach mathematics in a private school in Poona. The school became the basis for his political career. He developed the institution into a university college after founding the Deccan Education Society (1884), which aimed at educating the masses, especially in the English language; he and his associates considered English to be a powerful force for the dissemination of liberal and democratic ideals. The life members of the society were expected to follow an ideal of selfless service, but when Tilak learned that some members were keeping outside earnings for themselves, he resigned. He then turned to the task of awakening the political consciousness of the people through two weekly newspapers that he owned and edited: Kesari (“The Lion”), published in Marathi, and The Mahratta, published in English. Through those newspapers Tilak became widely known for his bitter criticisms of British rule and of those moderate nationalists who advocated social reforms along Western lines and political reforms along constitutional lines. He thought that social reform would only divert energy away from the political struggle for independence. Bal Gangadhar Tilak   Bal Gangadhar Tilak Tilak sought to widen the popularity of the nationalist movement (which at that time was largely confined to the upper classes) by introducing Hindu religious symbolism and by invoking popular traditions of the Maratha struggle against Muslim rule. He thus organized two important festivals, Ganesh in 1893 and Shivaji in 1895. Ganesha is the elephant- headed god worshipped by all Hindus, and Shivaji, the first Hindu hero to fight against Muslim power in India, was the founder of the Maratha state in the 17th century, which in the course of time overthrew Muslim power in India. But, though that symbolism made the nationalist movement more popular, it also made it more communal and thus alarmed the Muslims. Rise to national prominence Tilak’s activities aroused the Indian populace, but they soon also brought him into conflict with the British government, which prosecuted him for sedition and sent him to jail in 1897. The trial and sentence earned him the title Lokamanya (“Beloved Leader of the People”). He was released after 18 months. When Lord Curzon, viceroy of India, partitioned Bengal in 1905, Tilak strongly supported the Bengali demand for the annulment of the partition and advocated a boycott of British goods, which soon became a movement that swept the nation. The following year he set forth a program of passive resistance, known as the Tenets of the New Party, that he hoped would destroy the hypnotic influence of British rule and prepare the people for sacrifice in order to gain independence. Those forms of political action initiated by Tilak—the boycotting of goods and passive resistance—were later adopted by Mohandas (Mahatma) Gandhi in his program of nonviolent noncooperation with the British (satyagraha). Tilak’s approach was strong fare for the moderate Indian National Congress (Congress Party), which believed in making “loyal” representations to the government for small reforms. Tilak aimed at swarajya (independence), not piecemeal reforms, and attempted to persuade the Congress Party to adopt his militant program. On that issue, he clashed with the moderates during the party’s session (meeting) at Surat (now in Gujarat state) in 1907, and the party split. Taking advantage of the division in the nationalist forces, the government again prosecuted Tilak on a charge of sedition and inciting terrorism and deported him to Mandalay, Burma (Myanmar), to serve a six-year prison sentence. Bal Gangadhar Tilak   In the Mandalay jail, Tilak settled down to write his magnum opus, the Śrīmad Bhagavadgitā Rahasya (“Secret of the Bhagavadgita”)—also known as Bhagavad Gita or Gita Rahasya—an original exposition of the most-sacred book of the Hindus. Tilak discarded the orthodox interpretation that the Bhagavadgita (a component of the Mahabharata epic poem) taught the ideal of renunciation; in his view it taught selfless service to humanity. Earlier, in 1893, he had published The Orion; or, Researches into the Antiquity of the Vedas, and, a decade later, The Arctic Home in the Vedas. Both works were intended to promote Hindu culture as the successor to the Vedic religion and his belief that its roots were in the so-called Aryans from the north. On his release in 1914, on the eve of World War I, Tilak once more plunged into politics. He launched the Home Rule League with the rousing slogan “Swarajya is my birthright and I will have it.” (Activist Annie Besant also established an organization with the same name at about that time.) In 1916 he rejoined the Congress Party and signed the historic Lucknow Pact, a Hindu-Muslim accord, with Mohammed Ali Jinnah, the future founder of Pakistan. Tilak visited England in 1918 as president of the Indian Home Rule League. He realized that the Labour Party was a growing force in British politics, and he established firm relationships with its leaders. His foresight was justified: it was a Labour government that granted independence to India in 1947. Tilak was one of the first to maintain that Indians should cease to cooperate with foreign rule, but he always denied that he had ever encouraged the use of violence. By the time Tilak returned home in late 1919 to attend the meeting of the Congress Party at Amritsar, he had mellowed sufficiently to oppose Gandhi’s policy of boycotting the elections to the legislative councils established as part of the reforms that followed from the Montagu-Chelmsford Report to Parliament in 1918. Instead, Tilak advised the delegates to follow his policy of “responsive cooperation” in carrying out the reforms, which introduced a certain degree of Indian participation in regional government. He died, however, before he could give the new reforms a decisive direction. In tributes, Gandhi called him “the Maker of Modern India,” and Jawaharlal Nehru, independent India’s first prime minister, described him as “the Father of the Indian Revolution.” The Editors of Encyclopaedia Britannica This article was most recently revised and updated by Adam Zeidan.

Barthélemy Boganda
Barthélemy Boganda, (born April 4, 1910, Bobangui, Moyen-Congo, French Equatorial
Africa [now in Central African Republic]—died March 29, 1959, near Bangui), the major
nationalist leader of the Central African Republic (formerly Ubangi-Shari) in the critical
decolonization period of the 1950s. His strong popular support was unmatched by that of
any other political figure in the four colonies of French Equatorial Africa. Stridently
anticolonial but pragmatic, he could (and did) make deals with the colonial administration
and European businessmen to gain his ends.
Boganda was born of a peasant family and became the first African Roman Catholic priest
in Ubangi-Shari. He was sponsored by the Catholic missions as a candidate in the
November 1946 elections to the French National Assembly and won against an
administration-backed candidate. However, he soon denounced the missions as well as the
colonial administration, and he left the French Catholic party (the Republican Popular
Movement) and the priesthood. In 1949 he founded his own party, the Social Evolution
Movement of Black Africa, which he dominated completely. In the 1951 campaign a
French administrator briefly arrested him for “endangering the peace.”
Subsequently, Boganda’s prestige was essentially unchallenged. Even the French
government realized it was useless to oppose him and made efforts to conciliate him. In
1956 he also came to an agreement with French businessmen, who offered him financial
support in return for European representation on municipal and territorial election lists.
In 1957 Boganda became the president of the Grand Council of French Equatorial Africa
(which also included Chad, Gabon, and the French Congo). He hoped for a federation of
these states under African rather than French control and for the eventual creation of a
“United States of Latin Africa” that would also include Angola, the Belgian Congo,
Ruanda-Urundi, and Cameroon. By late 1958 this dream was shattered, and he turned his
attention again to the future Central African Republic.
In December 1958 Boganda became the prime minister of the Central African Republic,
which would not receive its official independence from France until 1960. Under Boganda
the government drafted a constitution for the republic. Boganda died in a plane crash in
1959 under suspicious circumstances. Many speculated that expatriate businessmen from

Benjamin Franklin
Benjamin Franklin
Benjamin Franklin, also called Ben Franklin,
pseudonym Richard Saunders, (born January 17
[January 6, Old Style], 1706, Boston, Massachusetts
[U.S.]—died April 17, 1790, Philadelphia,
Pennsylvania, U.S.), American printer and publisher,
author, inventor and scientist, and diplomat. One of
the foremost of the Founding Fathers, Franklin helped
draft the Declaration of Independence and was one of its signers, represented the United
States in France during the American Revolution, and was a delegate to the Constitutional
Convention. He made important contributions to science, especially in the understanding of
electricity, and is remembered for the wit, wisdom, and elegance of his writing.
Early life
Franklin was born the 10th son of the 17 children of a man who made soap and candles,
one of the lowliest of the artisan crafts. In an age that privileged the firstborn son, Franklin
was, as he tartly noted in his Autobiography, “the youngest Son of the youngest Son for
five Generations back.” He learned to read very early and had one year in grammar school
and another under a private teacher, but his formal education ended at age 10. At 12 he was
apprenticed to his brother James, a printer. His mastery of the printer’s trade, of which he
was proud to the end of his life, was achieved between 1718 and 1723. In the same period
he read tirelessly and taught himself to write effectively.
His first enthusiasm was for poetry, but, discouraged with the quality of his own, he gave it
up. Prose was another matter. Young Franklin discovered a volume of The Spectator—
featuring Joseph Addison and Sir Richard Steele’s famous periodical essays, which had
appeared in England in 1711–12—and saw in it a means for improving his writing. He read
these Spectator papers over and over, copied and recopied them, and then tried to recall
them from memory. He even turned them into poetry and then back into prose. Franklin
realized, as all the Founders did, that writing competently was such a rare talent in the 18th
century that anyone who could do it well immediately attracted attention. “Prose writing”
became, as he recalled in his Autobiography, “of great Use to me in the Course of my Life,
and was a principal Means of my Advancement.”

In 1721 James Franklin founded a weekly newspaper, the New-England Courant, to which
readers were invited to contribute. Benjamin, now 16, read and perhaps set in type these
contributions and decided that he could do as well himself. In 1722 he wrote a series of 14
essays signed “Silence Dogood” in which he lampooned everything from funeral eulogies
to the students of Harvard College. For one so young to assume the persona of a middle-
aged woman was a remarkable feat, and Franklin took “exquisite Pleasure” in the fact that
his brother and others became convinced that only a learned and ingenious wit could have
written these essays.
Late in 1722 James Franklin got into trouble with the provincial authorities and was
forbidden to print or publish the Courant. To keep the paper going, he discharged his
younger brother from his original apprenticeship and made him the paper’s nominal
publisher. New indentures were drawn up but not made public. Some months later, after a
bitter quarrel, Benjamin secretly left home, sure that James would not “go to law” and
reveal the subterfuge he had devised.
Youthful adventures
Failing to find work in New York City, Franklin at age 17 went on to Quaker-dominated
Philadelphia, a much more open and religiously tolerant place than Puritan Boston. One of
the most memorable scenes of the Autobiography is the description of his arrival on a
Sunday morning, tired and hungry. Finding a bakery, he asked for three pennies’ worth of
bread and got “three great Puffy Rolls.” Carrying one under each arm and munching on the
third, he walked up Market Street past the door of the Read family, where stood Deborah,
his future wife. She saw him and “thought I made, as I certainly did, a most awkward
ridiculous Appearance.”
A few weeks later he was rooming at the Reads’ and employed as a printer. By the spring of
1724 he was enjoying the companionship of other young men with a taste for reading, and
he was also being urged to set up in business for himself by the governor of Pennsylvania,
Sir William Keith. At Keith’s suggestion, Franklin returned to Boston to try to raise the
necessary capital. His father thought him too young for such a venture, so Keith offered to
foot the bill himself and arranged Franklin’s passage to England so that he could choose his
type and make connections with London stationers and booksellers. Franklin exchanged
“some promises” about marriage with Deborah Read and, with a young friend, James
Ralph, as his companion, sailed for London in November 1724, just over a year after
arriving in Philadelphia. Not until his ship was well out at sea did he realize that Governor
Keith had not delivered the letters of credit and introduction he had promised.

In London Franklin quickly found employment in his trade and was able to lend money to
Ralph, who was trying to establish himself as a writer. The two young men enjoyed the
theatre and the other pleasures of the city, including women. While in London, Franklin
wrote A Dissertation on Liberty and Necessity, Pleasure and Pain (1725), a Deistical
pamphlet inspired by his having set type for William Wollaston’s moral tract, The Religion
of Nature Delineated. Franklin argued in his essay that since human beings have no real
freedom of choice, they are not morally responsible for their actions. This was perhaps a
nice justification for his self-indulgent behaviour in London and his ignoring of Deborah,
to whom he had written only once. He later repudiated the pamphlet, burning all but one of
the copies still in his possession.
By 1726 Franklin was tiring of London. He considered becoming an itinerant teacher of
swimming, but, when Thomas Denham, a Quaker merchant, offered him a clerkship in his
store in Philadelphia with a prospect of fat commissions in the West Indian trade, he
decided to return home.
Achievements and inventions
Denham died, however, a few months after Franklin entered his store. The young man, now
20, returned to the printing trade and in 1728 was able to set up a partnership with a friend.
Two years later he borrowed money to become sole proprietor.
His private life at this time was extremely complicated. Deborah Read had married, but her
husband had deserted her and disappeared. One matchmaking venture failed because
Franklin wanted a dowry of £100 to pay off his business debt. A strong sexual drive, “that
hard-to-be-govern’d Passion of Youth,” was sending him to “low Women,” and he thought
he very much needed to get married. His affection for Deborah having “revived,” he “took
her to Wife” on September 1, 1730. At this point Deborah may have been the only woman
in Philadelphia who would have him, for he brought to the marriage an illegitimate son,
William, just borne of a woman who has never been identified. Franklin’s common-law
marriage lasted until Deborah’s death in 1774. They had a son, Franky, who died at age
four, and a daughter, Sarah, who survived them both. William was brought up in the
household and apparently did not get along well with Deborah.
Franklin and his partner’s first coup was securing the printing of Pennsylvania’s paper
currency. Franklin helped get this business by writing A Modest Enquiry into the Nature
and Necessity of a Paper Currency (1729), and later he also became public printer of New
Jersey, Delaware, and Maryland. Other moneymaking ventures included the Pennsylvania

Poor Richard's almanac
Gazette, published by Franklin from 1729 and
generally acknowledged as among the best of the
colonial newspapers, and Poor Richard’s almanac,
printed annually from 1732 to 1757. Despite some
failures, Franklin prospered. Indeed, he made enough
to lend money with interest and to invest in rental
properties in Philadelphia and many coastal towns.
He had franchises or partnerships with printers in the Carolinas, New York, and the British
West Indies. By the late 1740s he had become one of the wealthiest colonists in the
northern part of the North American continent.
As he made money, he concocted a variety of projects for social improvement. In 1727 he
organized the Junto, or Leather Apron Club, to debate questions of morals, politics, and
natural philosophy and to exchange knowledge of business affairs. The need of Junto
members for easier access to books led in 1731 to the organization of the Library Company
of Philadelphia. Through the Junto, Franklin proposed a paid city watch, or police force. A
paper read to the same group resulted in the organization of a volunteer fire company. In
1743 he sought an intercolonial version of the Junto, which led to the formation of the
American Philosophical Society. In 1749 he published Proposals Relating to the Education
of Youth in Pennsilvania; in 1751 the Academy of Philadelphia, from which grew the
University of Pennsylvania, was founded. He also became an enthusiastic member of the
Freemasons and promoted their “enlightened” causes.
Although still a tradesman, he was picking up some political offices. He became clerk of
the Pennsylvania legislature in 1736 and postmaster of Philadelphia in 1737. Prior to 1748,
though, his most important political service was his part in organizing a militia for the
defense of the colony against possible invasion by the French and the Spaniards, whose
privateers were operating in the Delaware River.
In 1748 Franklin, at age 42, had become wealthy enough to retire from active business. He
took off his leather apron and became a gentleman, a distinctive status in the 18th century.
Since no busy artisan could be a gentleman, Franklin never again worked as a printer;
instead, he became a silent partner in the printing firm of Franklin and Hall, realizing in the
next 18 years an average profit of over £600 annually. He announced his new status as a
gentleman by having his portrait painted in a velvet coat and a brown wig; he also acquired
a coat of arms and several enslaved persons and moved to a new and more spacious house
in “a more quiet Part of the Town.” Most important, as a gentleman and “master of [his]

own time,” he decided to do what other gentlemen did—engage in what he termed
“Philosophical Studies and Amusements.”
In the 1740s electricity was one of these curious amusements. It was introduced to
Philadelphians by an electrical machine sent to the Library Company by one of Franklin’s
English correspondents. In the winter of 1746–47, Franklin and three of his friends began
to investigate electrical phenomena. Franklin sent piecemeal reports of his ideas and
experiments to Peter Collinson, his Quaker correspondent in London. Since he did not
know what European scientists might have already discovered, Franklin set forth his
findings timidly. In 1751 Collinson had Franklin’s papers published in an 86-page book
titled Experiments and Observations on Electricity. In the 18th century the book went
through five English editions, three in French, and one each in Italian and German.
Franklin’s fame spread rapidly. The experiment he
suggested to prove the identity of lightning and
electricity was apparently first made in France before
he tried the simpler but more dangerous expedient of
flying a kite in a thunderstorm. But his other findings
were original. He created the distinction between
insulators and conductors. He invented a battery for
storing electrical charges. He coined new English words for the new science of electricity
—conductor, charge, discharge, condense, armature, electrify, and others. He showed that
electricity was a single “fluid” with positive and negative or plus and minus charges and
not, as traditionally thought, two kinds of fluids. And he demonstrated that the plus and
minus charges, or states of electrification of bodies, had to occur in exactly equal amounts
—a crucial scientific principle known today as the law of conservation of charge (see
charge conservation).

Public service
Despite the success of his electrical experiments,
Franklin never thought science was as important as
public service. As a leisured gentleman, he soon
became involved in more high-powered public
offices. He became a member of the Philadelphia City
Council in 1748, justice of the peace in 1749, and in
1751 a city alderman and a member of the

Pennsylvania Assembly. But he had his sights on being part of a larger arena, the British
Empire, which he regarded as “the greatest Political Structure Human Wisdom ever yet
erected.” In 1753 Franklin became a royal officeholder, deputy postmaster general, in
charge of mail in all the northern colonies. Thereafter he began to think in intercolonial
terms. In 1754 his “Plan of Union” for the colonies was adopted by the Albany Congress,
which was convened at the beginning of the French and Indian War and included
representatives from the Iroquois Confederacy. The plan called for the establishment of a
general council, with representatives from the several colonies, to organize a common
defense against the French. Neither the colonial legislatures nor the king’s advisers were
ready for such union, however, and the plan failed. But Franklin had become acquainted
with important imperial officials, and his ambition to succeed within the imperial hierarchy
had been whetted.
In 1757 he went to England as the agent of the Pennsylvania Assembly in order to get the
family of William Penn, the proprietors under the colony’s charter, to allow the colonial
legislature to tax their ungranted lands. But Franklin and some of his allies in the assembly
had a larger goal of persuading the British government to oust the Penn family as the
proprietors of Pennsylvania and make that colony a royal province. Except for a two-year
return to Philadelphia in 1762–64, Franklin spent the next 18 years living in London, most
of the time in the apartment of Margaret Stevenson, a widow, and her daughter Polly at 36
Craven Street near Charing Cross. His son, William, now age 27, accompanied him to
London along with two enslaved persons. Deborah and their daughter, Sally, age 14,
remained in Philadelphia.
Before he left for London, Franklin decided to bring his Poor Richard’s almanac to an end.
While at sea in 1757, he completed a 12-page preface for the final 1758 edition of the
almanac titled “Father Abraham’s Speech” and later known as the The Way to Wealth. In
this preface Father Abraham cites only those proverbs that concern hard work, thrift, and
financial prudence. The Way to Wealth eventually became the most widely reprinted of all
Franklin’s works, including the Autobiography.
This time Franklin’s experience in London was very different from his sojourn in 1724–26.
London was the largest city in Europe and the centre of the burgeoning British Empire, and
Franklin was famous; consequently, he met everyone else who was famous, including
David Hume, Captain James Cook, Joseph Priestley, and John Pringle, who was physician
to Lord Bute, the king’s chief minister. In 1759 Franklin received an honorary degree from
the University of Saint Andrews in Scotland, which led to his thereafter being called “Dr.

Franklin.” Another honorary degree followed in 1762 from the University of Oxford.
Everyone wanted to paint his portrait and make mezzotints for sale to the public. Franklin
fell in love with the sophistication of London and England; by contrast, he disparaged the
provinciality and vulgarity of America. He was very much the royalist, and he bragged of
his connection with Lord Bute, which enabled him in 1762 to get his son, William, then age
31, appointed royal governor of New Jersey.
Reluctantly, Franklin had to go back to Pennsylvania in 1762 in order to look after his post
office, but he promised his friends in London that he would soon return and perhaps stay
forever in England. After touring the post offices up and down North America, a trip of
1,780 miles (2,900 km), he had to deal with an uprising of some Scotch-Irish settlers in the
Paxton region of western Pennsylvania who were angry at the Quaker assembly’s
unwillingness to finance military protection from the Indians on the frontier. After losing an
election to the Pennsylvania Assembly in 1764, Franklin could hardly wait to get back to
London. Deborah stayed in Philadelphia, and Franklin never saw her again.
He soon had to face the problems arising from the Stamp Act of 1765, which created a
firestorm of opposition in America. Like other colonial agents, Franklin opposed
Parliament’s stamp tax, asserting that taxation ought to be the prerogative of the colonial
legislatures. But once he saw that passage of the tax was inevitable, he sought to make the
best of the situation. After all, he said, empires cost money. He ordered stamps for his
printing firm in Philadelphia and procured for his friend John Hughes the stamp agency for
Pennsylvania. In the process, he almost ruined his position in American public life and
nearly cost Hughes his life.
Franklin was shocked by the mobs that effectively prevented enforcement of the Stamp Act
everywhere in North America. He told Hughes to remain cool in the face of the mob. “A
firm Loyalty to the Crown and faithful Adherence to the Government of this Nation…,” he
said, “will always be the wisest Course for you and I to take, whatever may be the Madness
of the Populace or their blind Leaders.” Only Franklin’s four-hour testimony before
Parliament denouncing the act in 1766 saved his reputation in America. The experience
shook Franklin, and his earlier confidence in the wisdom of British officials became
punctuated by doubts and resentments. He began to feel what he called his “Americanness”
as never before.
During the next four or five years Franklin sought to bridge the growing gulf between the
colonies and the British government. Between 1765 and 1775 he wrote 126 newspaper

pieces, most of which tried to explain each side to the other. But, as he said, the English
thought him too American, while the Americans thought him too English. He had not,
however, given up his ambition of acquiring a position in the imperial hierarchy. But in
1771 opposition by Lord Hillsborough, who had just been appointed head of the new
American Department, left Franklin depressed and dispirited; in a mood of frustration,
nostalgia, and defiance, he began writing his Autobiography, which eventually became one
of the most widely read autobiographies ever published.
In recounting the first part of his life, up to age 25—the best part of the Autobiography,
most critics agree—Franklin sought to soothe his wounds and justify his apparent failure in
British politics. Most important, in this beginning part of his Autobiography, he in effect
was telling the world (and his son) that, as a free man who had established himself against
overwhelming odds as an independent and industrious artisan, he did not have to kowtow
to some patronizing, privileged aristocrat.
When the signals from the British government shifted and Hillsborough was dismissed
from the cabinet, Franklin dropped the writing of the Autobiography, which he would not
resume until 1784 in France following the successful negotiation of the treaty establishing
American independence. Franklin still thought he might be able to acquire an imperial
office and work to hold the empire together. But he became involved in the affair of the
Hutchinson letters—an affair that ultimately destroyed his position in England. In 1772
Franklin had sent back to Boston some letters written in the 1760s by Thomas Hutchinson,
then lieutenant governor of Massachusetts, in which Hutchinson had made some indiscreet
remarks about the need to abridge American liberties. Franklin naively thought that these
letters would somehow throw blame for the imperial crisis on native officials such as
Hutchinson and thus absolve the ministry in London of responsibility. This, Franklin
believed, would allow his friends in the ministry, such as Lord Dartmouth, to settle the
differences between the mother country and her colonies, with Franklin’s help.
The move backfired completely, and on January 29, 1774, Franklin stood silent in an
amphitheatre near Whitehall while being viciously attacked by the British solicitor-general
before the Privy Council and the court, most of whom were hooting and laughing. Two
days later he was fired as deputy postmaster. After some futile efforts at reconciliation, he
sailed for America in March 1775.
Although upon his arrival in Philadelphia Franklin was immediately elected to the Second
Continental Congress, some Americans remained suspicious of his real loyalties. He had

Franklin at the court of France
been so long abroad that some thought he might be a
British spy. He was delighted that the Congress in
1776 sent him back to Europe as the premier agent in
a commission seeking military aid and diplomatic
recognition from France. He played on the French
aristocracy’s liberal sympathies for the oppressed
Americans and extracted not only diplomatic
recognition of the new republic but also loan after loan from an increasingly impoverished
French government. His image as the democratic folk genius from the wilderness of
America preceded him, and he exploited it brilliantly for the American cause. His face
appeared everywhere—on medallions, on snuffboxes, on candy boxes, in rings, in statues,
in prints; women even did their hair à la Franklin. Franklin played his role to perfection. In
violation of all protocol, he dressed in a simple brown-and-white linen suit and wore a fur
cap, no wig, and no sword to the court of Versailles, the most formal and elaborate court in
all of Europe. And the French aristocracy and court loved it, caught up as they were with
the idea of America.
Beset with the pain of gout and a kidney stone, and
surrounded by spies and his sometimes clumsy fellow
commissioners—especially Arthur Lee of Virginia
and John Adams of Massachusetts, who disliked and
mistrusted him—Franklin nonetheless succeeded
marvelously. He first secured military and diplomatic
alliances with France in 1778 and then played a
crucial role in bringing about the final peace treaty
with Britain in 1783 (see Peace of Paris). In violation
of their instructions and the French alliance, the
American peace commissioners signed a separate
peace with Britain. It was left to Franklin to apologize
to the comte de Vergennes, Louis XVI’s chief
minister, which he did in a beautifully wrought
diplomatic letter.
No wonder the eight years in France were the happiest of Franklin’s life. He was doing
what he most yearned to do—shaping events on a world stage. At this point, in 1784, he
resumed work on his Autobiography, writing the second part of it, which presumes human
control over one’s life.

Last years
In 1785 Franklin reluctantly had to come to America
to die, even though all his friends were in France.
Although he feared he would be “a stranger in my
own country,” he now knew that his destiny was
linked to America.
His reception was not entirely welcoming. The family
and friends of the Lees in Virginia and the Adamses in Massachusetts spread stories of his
overweening love of France and his dissolute ways. The Congress treated him shabbily,
ignoring his requests for some land in the West and a diplomatic appointment for his
grandson. In 1788 he was reduced to petitioning the Congress with a pathetic “Sketch of
the Services of B. Franklin to the United States,” which the Congress never answered. Just
before his death in 1790, Franklin retaliated by signing a memorial requesting that the
Congress abolish slavery in the United States. This memorandum provoked some
congressmen into angry defenses of slavery, which Franklin exquisitely mocked in a
newspaper piece published a month before he died.
Upon his death the Senate refused to go along with the House in declaring a month of
mourning for Franklin. In contrast to the many expressions of French affection for
Franklin, his fellow Americans gave him one public eulogy—and that was delivered by his
inveterate enemy the Rev. William Smith, who passed over Franklin’s youth because it
seemed embarrassing.
Following the publication of the Autobiography in 1794, Franklin’s youth was no longer
embarrassing. In the succeeding decades, he became the hero of countless early 19th-
century artisans and self-made businessmen who were seeking a justification of their rise
and their moneymaking. They were the creators of the modern folksy image of Franklin,
the man who came to personify the American dream.
Legacy
Franklin was not only the most famous American in
the 18th century but also one of the most famous
figures in the Western world of the 18th century;
indeed, he is one of the most celebrated and
influential Americans who has ever lived. Although

one is apt to think of Franklin exclusively as an
inventor, as an early version of Thomas Edison, which he was, his 18th-century fame came
not simply from his many inventions but, more important, from his fundamental
contributions to the science of electricity. If there had been a Nobel Prize for Physics in the
18th century, Franklin would have been a contender. Enhancing his fame was the fact that
he was an American, a simple man from an obscure background who emerged from the
wilds of America to dazzle the entire intellectual world. Most Europeans in the 18th
century thought of America as a primitive, undeveloped place full of forests and savages
and scarcely capable of producing enlightened thinkers. Yet Franklin’s electrical
discoveries in the mid-18th century had surpassed the achievements of the most
sophisticated scientists of Europe. Franklin became a living example of the natural
untutored genius of the New World that was free from the encumbrances of a decadent and
tired Old World—an image that he later parlayed into French support for the American
Revolution.
Despite his great scientific achievements, however, Franklin always believed that public
service was more important than science, and his political contributions to the formation of
the United States were substantial. He had a hand in the writing of the Declaration of
Independence, contributed to the drafting of the Articles of Confederation—America’s first
national constitution—and was the oldest member of the Constitutional Convention of
1787 that wrote the Constitution of the United States of America in Philadelphia. More
important, as diplomatic representative of the new American republic in France during the
Revolution, he secured both diplomatic recognition and financial and military aid from the
government of Louis XVI and was a crucial member of the commission that negotiated the
treaty by which Great Britain recognized its former 13 colonies as a sovereign nation.
Since no one else could have accomplished all that he did in France during the Revolution,
he can quite plausibly be regarded as America’s greatest diplomat.
Equally significant perhaps were Franklin’s many
contributions to the comfort and safety of daily life,
especially in his adopted city of Philadelphia. No
civic project was too large or too small for his
interest. In addition to his lightning rod and his
Franklin stove (a wood-burning stove that warmed
American homes for more than 200 years), he
invented bifocal glasses, the odometer, and the glass
harmonica (armonica). He had ideas about everything—from the nature of the Gulf Stream

to the cause of the common cold. He suggested the notions of matching grants and Daylight
Saving Time. Almost single-handedly he helped to create a civic society for the inhabitants
of Philadelphia. Moreover, he helped to establish new institutions that people now take for
granted: a fire company, a library, an insurance company, an academy, and a hospital.
Probably Franklin’s most important invention was himself. He created so many personas in
his newspaper writings and almanac and in his posthumously published Autobiography that
it is difficult to know who he really was. Following his death in 1790, he became so
identified during the 19th century with the persona of his Autobiography and the Poor
Richard maxims of his almanac—e.g., “Early to bed, early to rise, makes a man healthy,
wealthy, and wise”—that he acquired the image of the self-made moralist obsessed with the
getting and saving of money. Consequently, many imaginative writers, such as Edgar Allan
Poe, Henry David Thoreau, Herman Melville, Mark Twain, and D.H. Lawrence, attacked
Franklin as a symbol of America’s middle-class moneymaking business values. Indeed,
early in the 20th century the famous German sociologist Max Weber found Franklin to be
the perfect exemplar of the “Protestant ethic” and the modern capitalistic spirit. Although
Franklin did indeed become a wealthy tradesman by his early 40s, when he retired from his
business, during his lifetime in the 18th century he was not identified as a self-made
businessman or a budding capitalist. That image was a creation of the 19th century. But as
long as America continues to be pictured as the land of enterprise and opportunity, where
striving and hard work can lead to success, then that image of Franklin is the one that is
likely to endure.

One of the foremost of the Founding Fathers, Franklin helped draft the Declaration of Independence and was one of its signers, represented the United States in France during the American Revolution, and was a delegate to the Constitutional Convention. He made important contributions to science, especially in the understanding of electricity, and is remembered for the wit, wisdom, and elegance of his writing. Early life Franklin was born the 10th son of the 17 children of a man who made soap and candles, one of the lowliest of the artisan crafts. In an age that privileged the firstborn son, Franklin was, as he tartly noted in his Autobiography, “the youngest Son of the youngest Son for five Generations back.” He learned to read very early and had one year in grammar school and another under a private teacher, but his formal education ended at age 10. At 12 he was apprenticed to his brother James, a printer. His mastery of the printer’s trade, of which he was proud to the end of his life, was achieved between 1718 and 1723. In the same period he read tirelessly and taught himself to write effectively. His first enthusiasm was for poetry, but, discouraged with the quality of his own, he gave it up. Prose was another matter. Young Franklin discovered a volume of The Spectator— featuring Joseph Addison and Sir Richard Steele’s famous periodical essays, which had appeared in England in 1711–12—and saw in it a means for improving his writing. He read these Spectator papers over and over, copied and recopied them, and then tried to recall them from memory. He even turned them into poetry and then back into prose. Franklin realized, as all the Founders did, that writing competently was such a rare talent in the 18th century that anyone who could do it well immediately attracted attention. “Prose writing” became, as he recalled in his Autobiography, “of great Use to me in the Course of my Life, and was a principal Means of my Advancement.”  Benjamin Franklin   In 1721 James Franklin founded a weekly newspaper, the New-England Courant, to which readers were invited to contribute. Benjamin, now 16, read and perhaps set in type these contributions and decided that he could do as well himself. In 1722 he wrote a series of 14 essays signed “Silence Dogood” in which he lampooned everything from funeral eulogies to the students of Harvard College. For one so young to assume the persona of a middle- aged woman was a remarkable feat, and Franklin took “exquisite Pleasure” in the fact that his brother and others became convinced that only a learned and ingenious wit could have written these essays. Late in 1722 James Franklin got into trouble with the provincial authorities and was forbidden to print or publish the Courant. To keep the paper going, he discharged his younger brother from his original apprenticeship and made him the paper’s nominal publisher. New indentures were drawn up but not made public. Some months later, after a bitter quarrel, Benjamin secretly left home, sure that James would not “go to law” and reveal the subterfuge he had devised. Youthful adventures Failing to find work in New York City, Franklin at age 17 went on to Quaker-dominated Philadelphia, a much more open and religiously tolerant place than Puritan Boston. One of the most memorable scenes of the Autobiography is the description of his arrival on a Sunday morning, tired and hungry. Finding a bakery, he asked for three pennies’ worth of bread and got “three great Puffy Rolls.” Carrying one under each arm and munching on the third, he walked up Market Street past the door of the Read family, where stood Deborah, his future wife. She saw him and “thought I made, as I certainly did, a most awkward ridiculous Appearance.” A few weeks later he was rooming at the Reads’ and employed as a printer. By the spring of 1724 he was enjoying the companionship of other young men with a taste for reading, and he was also being urged to set up in business for himself by the governor of Pennsylvania, Sir William Keith. At Keith’s suggestion, Franklin returned to Boston to try to raise the necessary capital. His father thought him too young for such a venture, so Keith offered to foot the bill himself and arranged Franklin’s passage to England so that he could choose his type and make connections with London stationers and booksellers. Franklin exchanged “some promises” about marriage with Deborah Read and, with a young friend, James Ralph, as his companion, sailed for London in November 1724, just over a year after arriving in Philadelphia. Not until his ship was well out at sea did he realize that Governor Keith had not delivered the letters of credit and introduction he had promised. Benjamin Franklin   In London Franklin quickly found employment in his trade and was able to lend money to Ralph, who was trying to establish himself as a writer. The two young men enjoyed the theatre and the other pleasures of the city, including women. While in London, Franklin wrote A Dissertation on Liberty and Necessity, Pleasure and Pain (1725), a Deistical pamphlet inspired by his having set type for William Wollaston’s moral tract, The Religion of Nature Delineated. Franklin argued in his essay that since human beings have no real freedom of choice, they are not morally responsible for their actions. This was perhaps a nice justification for his self-indulgent behaviour in London and his ignoring of Deborah, to whom he had written only once. He later repudiated the pamphlet, burning all but one of the copies still in his possession. By 1726 Franklin was tiring of London. He considered becoming an itinerant teacher of swimming, but, when Thomas Denham, a Quaker merchant, offered him a clerkship in his store in Philadelphia with a prospect of fat commissions in the West Indian trade, he decided to return home. Achievements and inventions Denham died, however, a few months after Franklin entered his store. The young man, now 20, returned to the printing trade and in 1728 was able to set up a partnership with a friend. Two years later he borrowed money to become sole proprietor. His private life at this time was extremely complicated. Deborah Read had married, but her husband had deserted her and disappeared. One matchmaking venture failed because Franklin wanted a dowry of £100 to pay off his business debt. A strong sexual drive, “that hard-to-be-govern’d Passion of Youth,” was sending him to “low Women,” and he thought he very much needed to get married. His affection for Deborah having “revived,” he “took her to Wife” on September 1, 1730. At this point Deborah may have been the only woman in Philadelphia who would have him, for he brought to the marriage an illegitimate son, William, just borne of a woman who has never been identified. Franklin’s common-law marriage lasted until Deborah’s death in 1774. They had a son, Franky, who died at age four, and a daughter, Sarah, who survived them both. William was brought up in the household and apparently did not get along well with Deborah. Franklin and his partner’s first coup was securing the printing of Pennsylvania’s paper currency. Franklin helped get this business by writing A Modest Enquiry into the Nature and Necessity of a Paper Currency (1729), and later he also became public printer of New Jersey, Delaware, and Maryland. Other moneymaking ventures included the Pennsylvania  Benjamin Franklin   Poor Richard's almanac Gazette, published by Franklin from 1729 and generally acknowledged as among the best of the colonial newspapers, and Poor Richard’s almanac, printed annually from 1732 to 1757. Despite some failures, Franklin prospered. Indeed, he made enough to lend money with interest and to invest in rental properties in Philadelphia and many coastal towns. He had franchises or partnerships with printers in the Carolinas, New York, and the British West Indies. By the late 1740s he had become one of the wealthiest colonists in the northern part of the North American continent. As he made money, he concocted a variety of projects for social improvement. In 1727 he organized the Junto, or Leather Apron Club, to debate questions of morals, politics, and natural philosophy and to exchange knowledge of business affairs. The need of Junto members for easier access to books led in 1731 to the organization of the Library Company of Philadelphia. Through the Junto, Franklin proposed a paid city watch, or police force. A paper read to the same group resulted in the organization of a volunteer fire company. In 1743 he sought an intercolonial version of the Junto, which led to the formation of the American Philosophical Society. In 1749 he published Proposals Relating to the Education of Youth in Pennsilvania; in 1751 the Academy of Philadelphia, from which grew the University of Pennsylvania, was founded. He also became an enthusiastic member of the Freemasons and promoted their “enlightened” causes. Although still a tradesman, he was picking up some political offices. He became clerk of the Pennsylvania legislature in 1736 and postmaster of Philadelphia in 1737. Prior to 1748, though, his most important political service was his part in organizing a militia for the defense of the colony against possible invasion by the French and the Spaniards, whose privateers were operating in the Delaware River. In 1748 Franklin, at age 42, had become wealthy enough to retire from active business. He took off his leather apron and became a gentleman, a distinctive status in the 18th century. Since no busy artisan could be a gentleman, Franklin never again worked as a printer; instead, he became a silent partner in the printing firm of Franklin and Hall, realizing in the next 18 years an average profit of over £600 annually. He announced his new status as a gentleman by having his portrait painted in a velvet coat and a brown wig; he also acquired a coat of arms and several enslaved persons and moved to a new and more spacious house in “a more quiet Part of the Town.” Most important, as a gentleman and “master of [his]  Benjamin Franklin   Benjamin Franklin “Join, or Die” own time,” he decided to do what other gentlemen did—engage in what he termed “Philosophical Studies and Amusements.” In the 1740s electricity was one of these curious amusements. It was introduced to Philadelphians by an electrical machine sent to the Library Company by one of Franklin’s English correspondents. In the winter of 1746–47, Franklin and three of his friends began to investigate electrical phenomena. Franklin sent piecemeal reports of his ideas and experiments to Peter Collinson, his Quaker correspondent in London. Since he did not know what European scientists might have already discovered, Franklin set forth his findings timidly. In 1751 Collinson had Franklin’s papers published in an 86-page book titled Experiments and Observations on Electricity. In the 18th century the book went through five English editions, three in French, and one each in Italian and German. Franklin’s fame spread rapidly. The experiment he suggested to prove the identity of lightning and electricity was apparently first made in France before he tried the simpler but more dangerous expedient of flying a kite in a thunderstorm. But his other findings were original. He created the distinction between insulators and conductors. He invented a battery for storing electrical charges. He coined new English words for the new science of electricity —conductor, charge, discharge, condense, armature, electrify, and others. He showed that electricity was a single “fluid” with positive and negative or plus and minus charges and not, as traditionally thought, two kinds of fluids. And he demonstrated that the plus and minus charges, or states of electrification of bodies, had to occur in exactly equal amounts —a crucial scientific principle known today as the law of conservation of charge (see charge conservation). Theodore Hornberger Gordon S. Wood Public service Despite the success of his electrical experiments, Franklin never thought science was as important as public service. As a leisured gentleman, he soon became involved in more high-powered public offices. He became a member of the Philadelphia City Council in 1748, justice of the peace in 1749, and in 1751 a city alderman and a member of the  Benjamin Franklin   Pennsylvania Assembly. But he had his sights on being part of a larger arena, the British Empire, which he regarded as “the greatest Political Structure Human Wisdom ever yet erected.” In 1753 Franklin became a royal officeholder, deputy postmaster general, in charge of mail in all the northern colonies. Thereafter he began to think in intercolonial terms. In 1754 his “Plan of Union” for the colonies was adopted by the Albany Congress, which was convened at the beginning of the French and Indian War and included representatives from the Iroquois Confederacy. The plan called for the establishment of a general council, with representatives from the several colonies, to organize a common defense against the French. Neither the colonial legislatures nor the king’s advisers were ready for such union, however, and the plan failed. But Franklin had become acquainted with important imperial officials, and his ambition to succeed within the imperial hierarchy had been whetted. In 1757 he went to England as the agent of the Pennsylvania Assembly in order to get the family of William Penn, the proprietors under the colony’s charter, to allow the colonial legislature to tax their ungranted lands. But Franklin and some of his allies in the assembly had a larger goal of persuading the British government to oust the Penn family as the proprietors of Pennsylvania and make that colony a royal province. Except for a two-year return to Philadelphia in 1762–64, Franklin spent the next 18 years living in London, most of the time in the apartment of Margaret Stevenson, a widow, and her daughter Polly at 36 Craven Street near Charing Cross. His son, William, now age 27, accompanied him to London along with two enslaved persons. Deborah and their daughter, Sally, age 14, remained in Philadelphia. Before he left for London, Franklin decided to bring his Poor Richard’s almanac to an end. While at sea in 1757, he completed a 12-page preface for the final 1758 edition of the almanac titled “Father Abraham’s Speech” and later known as the The Way to Wealth. In this preface Father Abraham cites only those proverbs that concern hard work, thrift, and financial prudence. The Way to Wealth eventually became the most widely reprinted of all Franklin’s works, including the Autobiography. This time Franklin’s experience in London was very different from his sojourn in 1724–26. London was the largest city in Europe and the centre of the burgeoning British Empire, and Franklin was famous; consequently, he met everyone else who was famous, including David Hume, Captain James Cook, Joseph Priestley, and John Pringle, who was physician to Lord Bute, the king’s chief minister. In 1759 Franklin received an honorary degree from the University of Saint Andrews in Scotland, which led to his thereafter being called “Dr. Benjamin Franklin   Franklin.” Another honorary degree followed in 1762 from the University of Oxford. Everyone wanted to paint his portrait and make mezzotints for sale to the public. Franklin fell in love with the sophistication of London and England; by contrast, he disparaged the provinciality and vulgarity of America. He was very much the royalist, and he bragged of his connection with Lord Bute, which enabled him in 1762 to get his son, William, then age 31, appointed royal governor of New Jersey. Reluctantly, Franklin had to go back to Pennsylvania in 1762 in order to look after his post office, but he promised his friends in London that he would soon return and perhaps stay forever in England. After touring the post offices up and down North America, a trip of 1,780 miles (2,900 km), he had to deal with an uprising of some Scotch-Irish settlers in the Paxton region of western Pennsylvania who were angry at the Quaker assembly’s unwillingness to finance military protection from the Indians on the frontier. After losing an election to the Pennsylvania Assembly in 1764, Franklin could hardly wait to get back to London. Deborah stayed in Philadelphia, and Franklin never saw her again. He soon had to face the problems arising from the Stamp Act of 1765, which created a firestorm of opposition in America. Like other colonial agents, Franklin opposed Parliament’s stamp tax, asserting that taxation ought to be the prerogative of the colonial legislatures. But once he saw that passage of the tax was inevitable, he sought to make the best of the situation. After all, he said, empires cost money. He ordered stamps for his printing firm in Philadelphia and procured for his friend John Hughes the stamp agency for Pennsylvania. In the process, he almost ruined his position in American public life and nearly cost Hughes his life. Franklin was shocked by the mobs that effectively prevented enforcement of the Stamp Act everywhere in North America. He told Hughes to remain cool in the face of the mob. “A firm Loyalty to the Crown and faithful Adherence to the Government of this Nation…,” he said, “will always be the wisest Course for you and I to take, whatever may be the Madness of the Populace or their blind Leaders.” Only Franklin’s four-hour testimony before Parliament denouncing the act in 1766 saved his reputation in America. The experience shook Franklin, and his earlier confidence in the wisdom of British officials became punctuated by doubts and resentments. He began to feel what he called his “Americanness” as never before. During the next four or five years Franklin sought to bridge the growing gulf between the colonies and the British government. Between 1765 and 1775 he wrote 126 newspaper  Benjamin Franklin   pieces, most of which tried to explain each side to the other. But, as he said, the English thought him too American, while the Americans thought him too English. He had not, however, given up his ambition of acquiring a position in the imperial hierarchy. But in 1771 opposition by Lord Hillsborough, who had just been appointed head of the new American Department, left Franklin depressed and dispirited; in a mood of frustration, nostalgia, and defiance, he began writing his Autobiography, which eventually became one of the most widely read autobiographies ever published. In recounting the first part of his life, up to age 25—the best part of the Autobiography, most critics agree—Franklin sought to soothe his wounds and justify his apparent failure in British politics. Most important, in this beginning part of his Autobiography, he in effect was telling the world (and his son) that, as a free man who had established himself against overwhelming odds as an independent and industrious artisan, he did not have to kowtow to some patronizing, privileged aristocrat. When the signals from the British government shifted and Hillsborough was dismissed from the cabinet, Franklin dropped the writing of the Autobiography, which he would not resume until 1784 in France following the successful negotiation of the treaty establishing American independence. Franklin still thought he might be able to acquire an imperial office and work to hold the empire together. But he became involved in the affair of the Hutchinson letters—an affair that ultimately destroyed his position in England. In 1772 Franklin had sent back to Boston some letters written in the 1760s by Thomas Hutchinson, then lieutenant governor of Massachusetts, in which Hutchinson had made some indiscreet remarks about the need to abridge American liberties. Franklin naively thought that these letters would somehow throw blame for the imperial crisis on native officials such as Hutchinson and thus absolve the ministry in London of responsibility. This, Franklin believed, would allow his friends in the ministry, such as Lord Dartmouth, to settle the differences between the mother country and her colonies, with Franklin’s help. The move backfired completely, and on January 29, 1774, Franklin stood silent in an amphitheatre near Whitehall while being viciously attacked by the British solicitor-general before the Privy Council and the court, most of whom were hooting and laughing. Two days later he was fired as deputy postmaster. After some futile efforts at reconciliation, he sailed for America in March 1775. Although upon his arrival in Philadelphia Franklin was immediately elected to the Second Continental Congress, some Americans remained suspicious of his real loyalties. He had  Benjamin Franklin   Declaration of Independence Benjamin Franklin and Louis XVI of France Franklin at the court of France been so long abroad that some thought he might be a British spy. He was delighted that the Congress in 1776 sent him back to Europe as the premier agent in a commission seeking military aid and diplomatic recognition from France. He played on the French aristocracy’s liberal sympathies for the oppressed Americans and extracted not only diplomatic recognition of the new republic but also loan after loan from an increasingly impoverished French government. His image as the democratic folk genius from the wilderness of America preceded him, and he exploited it brilliantly for the American cause. His face appeared everywhere—on medallions, on snuffboxes, on candy boxes, in rings, in statues, in prints; women even did their hair à la Franklin. Franklin played his role to perfection. In violation of all protocol, he dressed in a simple brown-and-white linen suit and wore a fur cap, no wig, and no sword to the court of Versailles, the most formal and elaborate court in all of Europe. And the French aristocracy and court loved it, caught up as they were with the idea of America. Beset with the pain of gout and a kidney stone, and surrounded by spies and his sometimes clumsy fellow commissioners—especially Arthur Lee of Virginia and John Adams of Massachusetts, who disliked and mistrusted him—Franklin nonetheless succeeded marvelously. He first secured military and diplomatic alliances with France in 1778 and then played a crucial role in bringing about the final peace treaty with Britain in 1783 (see Peace of Paris). In violation of their instructions and the French alliance, the American peace commissioners signed a separate peace with Britain. It was left to Franklin to apologize to the comte de Vergennes, Louis XVI’s chief minister, which he did in a beautifully wrought diplomatic letter. No wonder the eight years in France were the happiest of Franklin’s life. He was doing what he most yearned to do—shaping events on a world stage. At this point, in 1784, he resumed work on his Autobiography, writing the second part of it, which presumes human control over one’s life. Benjamin Franklin   Benjamin Franklin Last years In 1785 Franklin reluctantly had to come to America to die, even though all his friends were in France. Although he feared he would be “a stranger in my own country,” he now knew that his destiny was linked to America. His reception was not entirely welcoming. The family and friends of the Lees in Virginia and the Adamses in Massachusetts spread stories of his overweening love of France and his dissolute ways. The Congress treated him shabbily, ignoring his requests for some land in the West and a diplomatic appointment for his grandson. In 1788 he was reduced to petitioning the Congress with a pathetic “Sketch of the Services of B. Franklin to the United States,” which the Congress never answered. Just before his death in 1790, Franklin retaliated by signing a memorial requesting that the Congress abolish slavery in the United States. This memorandum provoked some congressmen into angry defenses of slavery, which Franklin exquisitely mocked in a newspaper piece published a month before he died. Upon his death the Senate refused to go along with the House in declaring a month of mourning for Franklin. In contrast to the many expressions of French affection for Franklin, his fellow Americans gave him one public eulogy—and that was delivered by his inveterate enemy the Rev. William Smith, who passed over Franklin’s youth because it seemed embarrassing. Following the publication of the Autobiography in 1794, Franklin’s youth was no longer embarrassing. In the succeeding decades, he became the hero of countless early 19th- century artisans and self-made businessmen who were seeking a justification of their rise and their moneymaking. They were the creators of the modern folksy image of Franklin, the man who came to personify the American dream. Legacy Franklin was not only the most famous American in the 18th century but also one of the most famous figures in the Western world of the 18th century; indeed, he is one of the most celebrated and influential Americans who has ever lived. Although  Benjamin Franklin   Benjamin Franklin map of the Gulf Stream drawn by Franklin one is apt to think of Franklin exclusively as an inventor, as an early version of Thomas Edison, which he was, his 18th-century fame came not simply from his many inventions but, more important, from his fundamental contributions to the science of electricity. If there had been a Nobel Prize for Physics in the 18th century, Franklin would have been a contender. Enhancing his fame was the fact that he was an American, a simple man from an obscure background who emerged from the wilds of America to dazzle the entire intellectual world. Most Europeans in the 18th century thought of America as a primitive, undeveloped place full of forests and savages and scarcely capable of producing enlightened thinkers. Yet Franklin’s electrical discoveries in the mid-18th century had surpassed the achievements of the most sophisticated scientists of Europe. Franklin became a living example of the natural untutored genius of the New World that was free from the encumbrances of a decadent and tired Old World—an image that he later parlayed into French support for the American Revolution. Despite his great scientific achievements, however, Franklin always believed that public service was more important than science, and his political contributions to the formation of the United States were substantial. He had a hand in the writing of the Declaration of Independence, contributed to the drafting of the Articles of Confederation—America’s first national constitution—and was the oldest member of the Constitutional Convention of 1787 that wrote the Constitution of the United States of America in Philadelphia. More important, as diplomatic representative of the new American republic in France during the Revolution, he secured both diplomatic recognition and financial and military aid from the government of Louis XVI and was a crucial member of the commission that negotiated the treaty by which Great Britain recognized its former 13 colonies as a sovereign nation. Since no one else could have accomplished all that he did in France during the Revolution, he can quite plausibly be regarded as America’s greatest diplomat. Equally significant perhaps were Franklin’s many contributions to the comfort and safety of daily life, especially in his adopted city of Philadelphia. No civic project was too large or too small for his interest. In addition to his lightning rod and his Franklin stove (a wood-burning stove that warmed American homes for more than 200 years), he invented bifocal glasses, the odometer, and the glass harmonica (armonica). He had ideas about everything—from the nature of the Gulf Stream  Benjamin Franklin   to the cause of the common cold. He suggested the notions of matching grants and Daylight Saving Time. Almost single-handedly he helped to create a civic society for the inhabitants of Philadelphia. Moreover, he helped to establish new institutions that people now take for granted: a fire company, a library, an insurance company, an academy, and a hospital. Probably Franklin’s most important invention was himself. He created so many personas in his newspaper writings and almanac and in his posthumously published Autobiography that it is difficult to know who he really was. Following his death in 1790, he became so identified during the 19th century with the persona of his Autobiography and the Poor Richard maxims of his almanac—e.g., “Early to bed, early to rise, makes a man healthy, wealthy, and wise”—that he acquired the image of the self-made moralist obsessed with the getting and saving of money. Consequently, many imaginative writers, such as Edgar Allan Poe, Henry David Thoreau, Herman Melville, Mark Twain, and D.H. Lawrence, attacked Franklin as a symbol of America’s middle-class moneymaking business values. Indeed, early in the 20th century the famous German sociologist Max Weber found Franklin to be the perfect exemplar of the “Protestant ethic” and the modern capitalistic spirit. Although Franklin did indeed become a wealthy tradesman by his early 40s, when he retired from his business, during his lifetime in the 18th century he was not identified as a self-made businessman or a budding capitalist. That image was a creation of the 19th century. But as long as America continues to be pictured as the land of enterprise and opportunity, where striving and hard work can lead to success, then that image of Franklin is the one that is likely to endure.

Benjamin Rush
Benjamin Rush, (born Jan. 4, 1746, [Dec. 24, 1745,
Old Style], Byberry, near Philadelphia—died April
19, 1813, Philadelphia), American physician and
political leader, a member of the Continental
Congress and a signer of the Declaration of
Independence. His encouragement of clinical research
and instruction was frequently offset by his insistence
upon bloodletting, purging, and other debilitating therapeutic measures.
Rush was born into a pious Presbyterian family. He was sent to a private academy and on
to the College of New Jersey at Princeton, from which he was graduated in 1760. After a
medical apprenticeship of six years, he sailed for Europe. He took a medical degree at the
University of Edinburgh in 1768 and then worked in London hospitals and briefly visited
Paris.
Returning home to begin medical practice in 1769, he was appointed professor of
chemistry in the College of Philadelphia, and in the following year he published his
Syllabus of a Course of Lectures on Chemistry, the first American textbook in this field.
Despite war and political upheavals, Rush’s practice grew to substantial proportions, partly
owing to his literary output. The standard checklist of early American medical imprints lists
65 publications under his name, not counting scores of communications to newspapers and
magazines. Another source of Rush’s professional prestige was the large number of his
private apprentices and students from all over the country. He taught some 3,000 students
during his tenure as professor of, successively, chemistry, the theory and practice of
medicine, and the institutes of medicine and clinical medicine in the College of
Philadelphia and the University of Pennsylvania. After 1790 his lectures were among the
leading cultural attractions of the city.
As a physician, Rush was a theorist, and a dogmatic one, rather than a scientific
pathologist. Striving for a simple, unitary explanation of disease, he conjectured that all
diseases are really one—a fever brought on by overstimulation of the blood vessels—and
hence subject to a simple remedy—“depletion” by bloodletting and purges. The worse the
fever, he believed, the more “heroic” the treatment it called for; in the epidemics of yellow
fever that afflicted Philadelphia in the 1790s his cures were more dreaded by some than the
disease.

In psychiatry Rush’s contributions were more enduring. For many years he laboured among
the insane patients at the Pennsylvania Hospital, advocating humane treatment for them on
the ground that mental disorders were as subject to healing arts as physical ones; indeed, he
held that insanity often proceeded from physical causes, an idea that was a long step
forward from the old notion that lunatics are possessed by devils. His Medical Inquiries
and Observations upon the Diseases of the Mind, published in 1812, was the first and for
many years the only American treatise on psychiatry.
Rush was an early and active American patriot. As a member of the radical provincial
conference in June 1776, he drafted a resolution urging independence and was soon elected
to the Continental Congress, signing the Declaration of Independence with other members
on August 2. For a year he served in the field as surgeon general and physician general of
the Middle Department of the Continental Army, but early in 1778 he resigned because he
considered the military hospitals mismanaged by his superior, who was supported by
General Washington. Rush went on to question Washington’s military judgment, a step that
he was to regret and one that clouded his reputation until recent times. He resumed the
practice and teaching of medicine and in 1797, by appointment of Pres. John Adams, took
on the duties of treasurer of the U.S. Mint. He held this office until his death.

Bernardo O’Higgins
Bernardo O’Higgins, (born probably Aug. 20, 1776/78, Chillán, Chile, Viceroyalty of
Peru—died October 1842, Peru), South American revolutionary leader and first Chilean
head of state (“supreme director,” 1817–23), who commanded the military forces that won
independence from Spain.
Bernardo O’Higgins was born in Chillán, a town in southern Chile, then a colony of Spain.
As noted in his Certificate of Baptism, he was the illegitimate son of Ambrosio O’Higgins,
a Spanish officer of Irish origin who became governor of Chile and later viceroy of Peru;
his mother was Isabel Riquelme, a prominent lady of Chillán.
Bernardo’s father had only indirect contact with his son, who used his maternal surname
until his father’s death. At 12, Bernardo was sent to Lima for his secondary education. Four
years later he went to Spain. At 17 he was sent to England for further education. In London
he became imbued with a sense of nationalist pride in Chile, a pride largely fostered by his
contact with several political activists, of whom Francisco Miranda, the Venezuelan
champion of Latin American independence, exerted the greatest influence on him. Along
with several other future revolutionary leaders, he belonged to a secret Masonic lodge,
established in London by Miranda, the members of which were dedicated to the
independence of Latin America. In 1799 he left England for Spain, where he came into
contact with Latin American clerics who also favoured independence and doubtless further
strengthened his views. His political position was remarkable in view of the fact that his
father was viceroy of Peru.
Bernardo’s father died in 1801, leaving him a large hacienda near Chillán; by 1803 he was
working the estate. This interlude may have been the most satisfying period of his life. The
hacienda began to prosper almost immediately, and Bernardo was soon maintaining a
house in Chillán. In 1806 he became a member of the local town council.
Before O’Higgins had time to settle into his agrarian way of life, however, the foundations
of Chilean society were threatened. In 1808 Napoleon invaded Spain, which, occupied with
its own defense, left its colonies, including Chile, largely uncontrolled; the first steps
toward national independence began to be taken throughout Spanish America. On Sept. 18,
1810, a national junta, composed of local leaders who replaced the governor-general, was
established in Santiago, and by 1811 Chile had its own congress. O’Higgins was a member,

and during the next two years he played a key role in the country’s turbulent political
affairs.
By early 1813 Chile had a constitution and a junta that seemed able to control the country
and to avert the threat of civil war. In 1814, however, the viceroy of Peru sponsored an
expedition to reestablish royal authority. Within a few months, O’Higgins rose from the
rank of colonel of militia to general in chief of the independentist forces. Soon he was also
appointed governor of the province of Concepción, in which the early fighting took place.
But the war went badly, and O’Higgins was superseded in command. In October 1814, at
Rancagua, the Chilean patriots led by him lost decisively to the royalist forces, which, for
the next three years, occupied the country.
Several thousand Chileans, including O’Higgins, crossed the Andes into Argentina in flight
from the royalists. O’Higgins spent the next three years preparing for the reconquest of
Chile. In January 1817 he returned to Chile with the Argentine general José de San Martín
and a combined army consisting of Argentine troops and Chilean exiles. At Chacabuco, on
Feb. 12, 1817, they decisively defeated the Spanish, and, with Chile largely reconquered,
O’Higgins was elected interim supreme director.
For the next six years, as supreme director, O’Higgins maintained, on balance, a successful
administration. He created a working governmental organization and provided the
essentials of the new nation—peace and order. Under adverse circumstances he succeeded
in building a national navy and in mounting a major military expedition against Peru to
fight the royalists.
O’Higgins, however, was not politically astute: by 1820 he had antagonized the
conservative church and the unruly aristocracy with his reforms. Later he alienated the
business community. He did not perceive the importance of a solid political base, and,
because his support was based on his prestige as a war leader in a threatened country, his
fall was assured once the danger of war had disappeared. O’Higgins was associated with a
grand scheme of continental independence that was essentially Argentine in its conception;
by the time of his resignation—under pressure—in January 1823, a growing Chilean
nationalism had rendered him and his Argentine colleagues much less attractive than they
had been in 1817.
In 1809, at the age of 31, O’Higgins had observed: “The career to which I seem inclined by
instinct and character, is that of labourer”; in rural life, he would have come to be “a good
campesino and a useful citizen.” As supreme director, O’Higgins had the positive attributes

3/3
of solid moral principles, an eagerness to work hard, and singular honesty. In the
countryside, as he himself understood, these virtues would have been ample, but in public
administration they were not enough.
From 1823 until his death, O’Higgins lived in exile in Peru, dividing his time between his
hacienda and Lima. His last years were poignantly similar to his first: in his youth,
circumstances required that he live away from home; now in maturity, circumstances again
conspired to keep him abroad. In both periods, he longed to return home.
Little is known of O’Higgins’s personal life. Though he never married, he managed to
acquire a family, in the same manner as his father had. His natural son Pedro Demetrio
O’Higgins was his companion in exile.
O’Higgins was a liberal in the 19th-century sense of the term and an admirer of the British
constitutional system. Although not as conservative as some contemporary Chilean leaders,
he was not a democrat either. While his reputation since his death has fluctuated with the
political predilections of governments and historians, his leading role in establishing Chile
as a republic remains unquestioned.

Bernardo O’Higgins was born in Chillán, a town in southern Chile, then a colony of Spain. As noted in his Certificate of Baptism, he was the illegitimate son of Ambrosio O’Higgins, a Spanish officer of Irish origin who became governor of Chile and later viceroy of Peru; his mother was Isabel Riquelme, a prominent lady of Chillán. Bernardo’s father had only indirect contact with his son, who used his maternal surname until his father’s death. At 12, Bernardo was sent to Lima for his secondary education. Four years later he went to Spain. At 17 he was sent to England for further education. In London he became imbued with a sense of nationalist pride in Chile, a pride largely fostered by his contact with several political activists, of whom Francisco Miranda, the Venezuelan champion of Latin American independence, exerted the greatest influence on him. Along with several other future revolutionary leaders, he belonged to a secret Masonic lodge, established in London by Miranda, the members of which were dedicated to the independence of Latin America. In 1799 he left England for Spain, where he came into contact with Latin American clerics who also favoured independence and doubtless further strengthened his views. His political position was remarkable in view of the fact that his father was viceroy of Peru. Bernardo’s father died in 1801, leaving him a large hacienda near Chillán; by 1803 he was working the estate. This interlude may have been the most satisfying period of his life. The hacienda began to prosper almost immediately, and Bernardo was soon maintaining a house in Chillán. In 1806 he became a member of the local town council. Before O’Higgins had time to settle into his agrarian way of life, however, the foundations of Chilean society were threatened. In 1808 Napoleon invaded Spain, which, occupied with its own defense, left its colonies, including Chile, largely uncontrolled; the first steps toward national independence began to be taken throughout Spanish America. On Sept. 18, 1810, a national junta, composed of local leaders who replaced the governor-general, was established in Santiago, and by 1811 Chile had its own congress. O’Higgins was a member,  Bernardo O’Higgins   and during the next two years he played a key role in the country’s turbulent political affairs. By early 1813 Chile had a constitution and a junta that seemed able to control the country and to avert the threat of civil war. In 1814, however, the viceroy of Peru sponsored an expedition to reestablish royal authority. Within a few months, O’Higgins rose from the rank of colonel of militia to general in chief of the independentist forces. Soon he was also appointed governor of the province of Concepción, in which the early fighting took place. But the war went badly, and O’Higgins was superseded in command. In October 1814, at Rancagua, the Chilean patriots led by him lost decisively to the royalist forces, which, for the next three years, occupied the country. Several thousand Chileans, including O’Higgins, crossed the Andes into Argentina in flight from the royalists. O’Higgins spent the next three years preparing for the reconquest of Chile. In January 1817 he returned to Chile with the Argentine general José de San Martín and a combined army consisting of Argentine troops and Chilean exiles. At Chacabuco, on Feb. 12, 1817, they decisively defeated the Spanish, and, with Chile largely reconquered, O’Higgins was elected interim supreme director. For the next six years, as supreme director, O’Higgins maintained, on balance, a successful administration. He created a working governmental organization and provided the essentials of the new nation—peace and order. Under adverse circumstances he succeeded in building a national navy and in mounting a major military expedition against Peru to fight the royalists. O’Higgins, however, was not politically astute: by 1820 he had antagonized the conservative church and the unruly aristocracy with his reforms. Later he alienated the business community. He did not perceive the importance of a solid political base, and, because his support was based on his prestige as a war leader in a threatened country, his fall was assured once the danger of war had disappeared. O’Higgins was associated with a grand scheme of continental independence that was essentially Argentine in its conception; by the time of his resignation—under pressure—in January 1823, a growing Chilean nationalism had rendered him and his Argentine colleagues much less attractive than they had been in 1817. In 1809, at the age of 31, O’Higgins had observed: “The career to which I seem inclined by instinct and character, is that of labourer”; in rural life, he would have come to be “a good campesino and a useful citizen.” As supreme director, O’Higgins had the positive attributes  Bernardo O’Higgins   of solid moral principles, an eagerness to work hard, and singular honesty. In the countryside, as he himself understood, these virtues would have been ample, but in public administration they were not enough. From 1823 until his death, O’Higgins lived in exile in Peru, dividing his time between his hacienda and Lima. His last years were poignantly similar to his first: in his youth, circumstances required that he live away from home; now in maturity, circumstances again conspired to keep him abroad. In both periods, he longed to return home. Little is known of O’Higgins’s personal life. Though he never married, he managed to acquire a family, in the same manner as his father had. His natural son Pedro Demetrio O’Higgins was his companion in exile. O’Higgins was a liberal in the 19th-century sense of the term and an admirer of the British constitutional system. Although not as conservative as some contemporary Chilean leaders, he was not a democrat either. While his reputation since his death has fluctuated with the political predilections of governments and historians, his leading role in establishing Chile as a republic remains unquestioned.

Bhagat Singh
Bhagat Singh
Bhagat Singh, (born September 27, 1907, Lyallpur,
western Punjab, India [now in Pakistan]—died March
23, 1931, Lahore [now in Pakistan]), revolutionary
hero of the Indian independence movement.
Bhagat Singh attended Dayanand Anglo Vedic High
School, which was operated by Arya Samaj (a reform
sect of modern Hinduism), and then National College, both located in Lahore. He began to
protest British rule in India while still a youth and soon fought for national independence.
He also worked as a writer and editor in Amritsar for Punjabi- and Urdu-language
newspapers espousing Marxist theories. He is credited with popularizing the catchphrase
“Inquilab zindabad” (“Long live the revolution”).
In 1928 Bhagat Singh plotted with others to kill the police chief responsible for the death of
Indian writer and politician Lala Lajpat Rai, one of the founders of National College,
during a silent march opposing the Simon Commission. Instead, in a case of mistaken
identity, junior officer J.P. Saunders was killed, and Bhagat Singh had to flee Lahore to
escape the death penalty. In 1929 he and an associate lobbed a bomb at the Central
Legislative Assembly in Delhi to protest the implementation of the Defence of India Act
and then surrendered. He was hanged at the age of 23 for the murder of Saunders.

Bhikaiji Cama
Bhikaiji Cama, née Bhikaiji Patel, Bhikaiji also spelled Bhikaji, also known as Madame
Cama, (born September 24, 1861, Bombay [now Mumbai], India—died August 13, 1936,
Bombay), Indian political activist and advocate for women’s rights who had the unique
distinction of unfurling the first version of the Indian national flag—a tricolour of green,
saffron, and red stripes—at the International Socialist Congress held at Stuttgart, Germany,
in 1907.
Born to an extremely wealthy Parsi business family, Bhikaiji Patel received her early
education in Bombay (now Mumbai). Influenced by an environment in which the Indian
nationalist movement was taking root, she was drawn toward political issues at an early
age. In 1885 she married Rustomji Cama, a well-known lawyer, but her involvement with
sociopolitical issues led to differences between the couple. Because of marital problems
and her poor health, which required medical attention, Cama left India for London.
During her stay there, she met Dadabhai Naoroji, a strong critic of British economic policy
in India, and began working for the Indian National Congress. Cama also came in contact
with other Indian nationalists, including Vir Savarkar, Lala Har Dayal, and Shyamji
Krishnavarma, and addressed several meetings in London’s Hyde Park.
After the 1907 conference in Stuttgart, Cama traveled abroad on an extended lecture tour to
mobilize public opinion against British rule in India, especially among expatriate Indians;
she also spoke in favour of women’s rights. When rumours began that she would be
deported from England, she moved in 1909 to Paris, where her home became a
headquarters for those agitating for Indian independence. She helped Har Dayal launch his
revolutionary paper Bande Mataram, copies of which were smuggled into India from
London. For three years during World War I, after Great Britain and France became allies,
the French authorities interned her for her anti-British activities. She maintained active
contacts with Indian, Irish, and Egyptian revolutionaries and liaised with French Socialists
and Russian leadership. In 1935, at the age of 75, she was allowed to return to India, where
she died the following year.

swadeshi (exclusive use of Indian-made goods) and
swaraj (independence).
Though originally considered a moderate within the Indian National Congress, by 1919 Pal
had moved closer to the more militant policies of Bal Gangadhar Tilak, one of the leading
nationalist politicians. In later years Pal allied himself with fellow Bengali nationalists who
resented the cult of personality surrounding Mahatma Gandhi, the most popular nationalist
leader. Pal’s overriding concern in his writings from 1912 to 1920 was to achieve
confederation of the different regions and different communities within India. After 1920
he remained aloof from national politics but continued to contribute to Bengali journals.

Burhanuddin bin Muhammad Nūr al-Hilmī
Burhanuddin bin Muhammad Nūr al-Hilmī, (born 1911, Kota Bharu, Malaya [now in
Malaysia]—died October 25, 1969, Taiping, Malaysia), Malay nationalist leader who led
the principal opposition party in Malaya in the decades after World War II.
Nūr al-Hilmī attended Islamic schools at home and in Sumatra before going to India in
1928. On his return home, he taught at a madrasah (Muslim school) in Singapore and
became a member of the radical Young Malay Union. During the Japanese occupation he
was an adviser on Malay custom and culture to the military administration. After the war,
however, he emerged as a major national leader when he was elected president of the left-
wing Malay Nationalist Party (MNP). Under his leadership the party worked with other
left-wing organizations to produce constitutional proposals for an independent and
multiracial Malaya. The outbreak of the Communist Emergency in 1948 brought an abrupt
end to constitutional politics in Malaya, and Nūr al-Hilmī himself was detained by the
British for two years from 1950 for supposed involvement in anti-British riots in
Singapore. The MNP having been dissolved, Nūr al-Hilmī was now a politician without an
effective party. In 1956 he became president of the Pan-Malayan Islamic Party (PMIP), an
organization whose own origins can be traced back to the MNP and associated nationalist
groups in the late 1940s. Under his leadership, the PMIP became the principal opposition
party in Malaysian politics, winning a substantial share of the Malay vote (Nūr al-Hilmī
himself was elected to the parliament in 1959) and mounting a strong agrarian-populist and
anticolonialist attack, especially upon the Malay centrist party. Detained again in 1965 for
alleged pro-Indonesian activities during that country’s “Confrontation” with Malaysia, he
was released in 1966, in poor health and subject to stringent political surveillance. He
continued as nominal president of the party until his death.

During the Japanese occupation he was an adviser on Malay custom and culture to the military administration. After the war, however, he emerged as a major national leader when he was elected president of the left- wing Malay Nationalist Party (MNP). Under his leadership the party worked with other left-wing organizations to produce constitutional proposals for an independent and multiracial Malaya. The outbreak of the Communist Emergency in 1948 brought an abrupt end to constitutional politics in Malaya, and Nūr al-Hilmī himself was detained by the British for two years from 1950 for supposed involvement in anti-British riots in Singapore. The MNP having been dissolved, Nūr al-Hilmī was now a politician without an effective party. In 1956 he became president of the Pan-Malayan Islamic Party (PMIP), an organization whose own origins can be traced back to the MNP and associated nationalist groups in the late 1940s. Under his leadership, the PMIP became the principal opposition party in Malaysian politics, winning a substantial share of the Malay vote (Nūr al-Hilmī himself was elected to the parliament in 1959) and mounting a strong agrarian-populist and anticolonialist attack, especially upon the Malay centrist party. Detained again in 1965 for alleged pro-Indonesian activities during that country’s “Confrontation” with Malaysia, he was released in 1966, in poor health and subject to stringent political surveillance. He continued as nominal president of the party until his death. This article was most recently revised and updated by Virginia Gorlinski.",

Camillo Benso, count di Cavour
Camillo Benso, count di Cavour, (born August 10,
1810, Turin, Piedmont, French Empire—died June 6,
1861, Turin, Italy), Piedmontese statesman, a
conservative whose exploitation of international
rivalries and of revolutionary movements brought
about the unification of Italy (1861) under the House
of Savoy, with himself as the first prime minister of the new kingdom.
Family and early life
The Cavours were an ancient family that had served the House of Savoy as soldiers and
officials since the 16th century. Genevan by birth and Calvinist by religion, his mother
brought into the Cavour family the influence of Geneva, a city open to all the political,
religious, and social movements of the period. The French Revolution imperilled the
fortunes of the Cavours because of their close ties with the ancien régime; but Cavour’s
father, Michele, reestablished the family in an eminent position in Napoleonic society.
Camillo even had as godparents Prince Camillo Borghese—after whom he was named—
and Pauline Bonaparte, the Prince’s wife and Napoleon’s favourite sister.
At the age of 10 he was enrolled at the Military Academy of Turin. As the younger son who
could not hope for the economic and social position that would fall to his elder brother,
Camillo saw a brilliant career open up before him under the protection of the court of
Charles Albert, prince of Savoy and Piedmont. In 1826 he obtained a commission as
lieutenant in the corps of engineers.
During his six years at the academy political ideas began to fascinate him; echoes of the
constitutionalist Piedmontese revolution of 1821 reached the school, provoking in some of
its members a flash of liberal and national spirit that was, however, immediately
extinguished. Among his family, Camillo heard the great issues of the day being discussed:
the internal politics of France under the restored Bourbons; the revolt against Turkish
repression in Greece; the liberal Decembrist rising in Russia in 1825. He showed his
sympathy, in his usual enthusiastic manner, with the liberals and with personalities such as
Benjamin Franklin and Santorre di Santarosa, the famous ill-fated leader of the 1821
revolution in Piedmont, who was also a distant relative. A close friendship with a cadet
three years his senior, Baron Severino Cassio, seems to have had a particular influence on

2/8
his political views. Cassio, suspected of republicanism, imbued Camillo with patriotic
ideas.
The Cavour family, greatly disturbed by their son’s association with a cadet holding
compromising political views, ordered Camillo to terminate it—not without provoking his
indignation and bitterness. This interference of the family was dictated by expediency, for
in July 1824 the marchese Michele had obtained for Camillo the appointment as personal
page to Charles Albert. His lack of enthusiasm for the court position and his open ridicule
of the page-boy’s uniform he was obliged to wear caused a scandal and confirmed the
growing suspicions about the rebellious disposition of the young count Cavour. The
insulted Charles Albert banished Camillo from court and—vainly—tried to persuade King
Charles Felix to strip Camillo of his commission. The episode created an irreparable break
between Camillo and the hereditary prince and for about 20 years made it impossible for
Cavour to take any part in official political life.
Development of political ideals
His military career began in the engineers. He was first stationed in Turin, then in various
frontier posts, where fortifications were being constructed; yet, wherever he was, Cavour
remained dissatisfied. In 1830 he was sent to Genoa, where he met Anna Giustiniani
Schiaffino, an ardent advocate of ultrademocratic and republican ideas, whose salon was
frequented by many members of the Carbonari, the secret revolutionary society whose
guiding force then was Giuseppe Mazzini. Cavour’s fervent radicalism was inspired by his
love for Anna Schiaffino and by his renewed friendship with Severino Cassio, now a fellow
officer in the engineers at Genoa.
The French revolution of July 1830, which overthrew the last Bourbon, Charles X, and
installed Louis-Philippe, “the citizen king,” also played a great part in strengthening
Cavour’s revolutionary ardour. Under the direction of Severino Cassio, he studied English
in order to follow more easily the newspapers reporting political events in Europe. He was
influenced by the liberal ideas of the French writers Benjamin Constant and François
Guizot, and his adversaries remained those of his childhood: paternalistic absolutism;
legitimist reactionaries representing the landed interests, the aristocracy, and the clergy; and
the union of throne and altar. Of necessity this attitude pitted him consciously against the
caste to which he belonged.
The influence of the events in France on the temperamental Cavour once again aroused
official suspicions, and this time he was subjected to police surveillance. As usual, his

father’s intervention helped to avert more serious consequences; in this case he was simply
transferred to a remote mountain fort. It had become obvious, however, that he could no
longer remain in the army, from which he resigned in 1831. His father found him a sort of
occupation: he was appointed mayor of a village south of Turin and also became the
administrator of extensive holdings in the vicinity belonging to his uncles.
Although these modest occupations served to fill his time and to insulate him from his
family, they aggravated his despondency over what appeared to be the end of his political
ambitions. Social interests began to absorb him: the problems of poverty and of prisoner
education became the subjects of his researches. In 1834 he wrote a memoir on poverty in
Piedmont, which was published the following year in London in the Report from His
Majesty’s Commissioners for inquiring into the Administration and practical Operation of
the Poor Laws. A second pamphlet on the history of the Poor Laws in England was edited
and published by Cavour in 1835 at Turin.
During those years he was at last able to make his first long-awaited visit to Paris and
London, thus widening his knowledge of Europe. He now came to know the two greatest
and most advanced Western capitals—both ruled by constitutional and liberal regimes
(however much they differed in character) and both attempting to effect the boldest
economic and social changes. He took a feverishly active interest in the parliamentary life
of England and France; he attended university lectures and visited factories, railways,
ports, hospitals, schools, and prisons. The experience he acquired in the two Western
capitals and in Geneva set him firmly on the path he had already instinctively chosen:
always to follow the “golden mean.” He was repelled equally by the revolutionaries who
wished to destroy society through terror in order to construct a better one without realizing
that their methods would defile human dignity, and by the reactionaries, who, in blindly
opposing all progress, eventually provoked revolutionary uprisings. Rejecting all extremes,
he wanted above all to be a good European. Yet Cavour always remained a patriot. When
his worth and his great ambition were acknowledged in France and one of his friends
invited him to abandon the petty and wretched Piedmont of Charles Albert for a brilliant
career in France, Cavour rejected the invitation.
In 1835, after his return from his travels, he began to engage in a fruitful series of
enterprises that helped him to accumulate a considerable fortune. He also achieved a
certain reputation with his writing. Even without directly facing the question of Italy’s
future political structure, all his writings proclaimed social or economic principles that
could in no way be reconciled with the prevailing conditions in Italy. Above all, the

economic measures and the construction of railroads proposed by Cavour would have
transformed the Italy of that period beyond recognition.
Statesman
Gradually, as the year 1848 drew near and the first
gusts of the great revolutionary storm of that year
could be felt, Cavour’s interest in politics began once
more to dominate all others. This is shown by the
chronological sequence of his writings. His transition
to politics was completed when King Charles Albert
decided to embark on measures of reform and to concede a certain amount of freedom to
the press. Cavour took advantage of this to found the newspaper Il Risorgimento, which
soon became the champion of increasingly drastic reforms. After taking a leading part in
persuading Charles Albert to grant a liberal constitution, Cavour used Il Risorgimento to
propagate the idea of an immediate war with Austria (which still ruled Lombardy and
Venetia) as a historical necessity. Once elected a member of Parliament in June 1848,
however, he assumed an intermediate position between the conservatives and the
revolutionaries, thus calling forth the enmity of both left and right.
The war against Austria was undertaken, but developments went against the Piedmontese.
This prompted Cavour to offer his services as a volunteer until, on being elected a deputy
in the third Legislature (July 1848), he began to fight for the approval of a peace treaty with
Austria, although the extremists of the left wanted to continue a war that was, in effect,
already lost. The intelligence and expertise he displayed in the debates on financial and
military questions gained him a prominent place among the deputies of the majority that
supported the right-wing government of Massimo d’Azeglio. In October 1850, he was
offered the post of minister of agriculture and soon became the most active and influential
member of the Cabinet. Through a series of treaties with France, Belgium, and England,
Cavour attempted to bring about the greatest possible amount of free trade. He also sought
to form a network of economic interests with the great powers to pave the way for a
political alliance against Austria. His appointment as minister of finance in 1850 was
evidence of his growing ambitions.
Cavour now sought to create an alliance between the centre right and the centre left that
would form a new majority with greater ability to move toward a policy of secularization
and modernization in Piedmont. The alliance, called the connubio (“marriage”), brought
about the resignation of d’Azeglio, whose parliamentary standing had been completely

destroyed. After vain attempts to restore an effective d’Azeglio ministry, Victor Emmanuel
II, who had succeeded his father Charles Albert in 1849, resigned himself to entrusting the
formation of a government to Cavour, who from that time (Nov. 4, 1852) until his death
was his country’s acknowledged political leader.
The European drama into which Cavour was drawn against his will began in 1854 with the
Crimean War (1853–56), which saw France and England allied against Russia in order to
defend the integrity of the Turkish territory threatened by Russia’s determination to open
the Dardanelles for passage from the Black Sea to the Mediterranean. Victor Emmanuel
immediately pledged his help to the French and English representatives. Cavour, whose
ministers voted against the Crimean venture, was on the point of being dismissed by the
King if he rejected the alliance or of being forced to resign by his colleagues if he accepted
it. Accepting the alliance with customary boldness and self-confidence, he averted
dismissal by the King and embarked upon war. The turning point of the war came with the
Anglo-French-Sardinian victory that persuaded Austria to cast aside its neutrality and, by
means of an ultimatum, force Russia to make peace.
With some difficulty, Cavour secured the participation of the small power of Piedmont in
the peace negotiations at the Congress of Paris (1856), at which the greatest European
powers were represented. By supporting Napoleon III’s undeclared yet obvious intention to
intervene militarily in Italy in the near future and by taking advantage of the general
animosity toward Austria, which had joined the allies in the Crimean War only when
victory over Russia was assured, Cavour succeeded in proposing the discussion of the
Italian problem on the grounds that it was one that threatened European peace. In his view,
peace was threatened by Austrian encroachment, papal misgovernment in central Italy, and
the autocratic rule of the Spanish Bourbons in southern Italy. Thus, for the first time, the
Italian question was presented for diplomatic consideration in a manner favouring the
liberation of the peninsula. The difficulty was to persuade the two great powers, France and
England, to persevere in their support of an anti-Austrian policy on the part of Piedmont.
In Paris, Cavour had occasion to meet and appraise the stature of Europe’s most capable
diplomats and to examine the reasons behind the policies of the great powers. He knew full
well that it was illusory to hope for the disinterested assistance of Europe in the Italian
cause; nevertheless, with his tireless energy and unlimited capacity to take advantage of the
most adverse situations, he finally succeeded in winning Napoleon III over to his side. His
trump card was the proposition to reestablish France as the leading power on the Continent

by an expedition into Italy that would replace Austrian domination of the peninsula with
French rule.
At a secret meeting at Plombières in July 1858, Napoleon III and Cavour agreed to provoke
a European war against Austria in the following year. At the first suspicions of a secret
agreement, the European powers—especially England—began a campaign to prevent the
French and Piedmontese from carrying out their intentions, a campaign so intense that
Cavour saw himself being dragged toward the brink of personal and national catastrophe.
He was saved by an incredible blunder on the part of Austria, which sent an ultimatum
threatening war unless Piedmont disarmed at once. The Franco-Piedmontese alliance
accordingly came into force, and this time Austria’s superior military power was
counterbalanced by the French contribution. Franco-Piedmontese victories followed one
after another until Napoleon signed an armistice with Emperor Francis Joseph I at
Villafranca in July 1859.
The war had unleashed revolutionary movements in Tuscany, in the duchies of Modena and
Parma, and in the papal states between the Po and the Apennines, from Bologna to
Cattolica; the ducal rulers had been expelled, as had the papal legates. The armistice
seemed to call everything into question, except for Victor Emmanuel’s acquisition of
Lombardy, which was a minimal gain compared with Cavour’s dreams of liberating Italy
from the Alps to the Adriatic. At Villafranca, Cavour vented his rage and frustration on the
King and resigned his office.
Contrary to his usual perception, he realized only later the advantages to be derived from
the armistice. The revolutionary landslide in Italy could no longer be checked, nor could
the French emperor withdraw from his position as protector of Italian self-determination.
After being returned to power by the reluctant king in January 1860, Cavour worked for the
annexation of the central duchies that had formerly belonged to the ancient rulers of
Piedmont; he was able to do this only by ceding Savoy and Nice to France.
Unification of Italy
The surrender of Nice to France vastly sharpened the conflict between Cavour and
Giuseppe Garibaldi, for Nice was the popular hero’s birthplace. The surrender of
Piedmont’s Alpine bulwark could be compensated for only by territorial expansion into
central Italy (at the pope’s expense) and into the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies. But Cavour,
by now the black sheep of European diplomacy for having disturbed its tranquillity too

often, was not in a position to take the initiative, even though England now favoured his
policy.
It was Garibaldi who resolved the stalemate caused by Cavour’s enforced inactivity. Sailing
with his famous Thousand to Sicily, he destroyed Bourbon rule there and in the south. The
daring diplomacy of Piedmont and Cavour seemed momentarily to be eclipsed by the
military exploits of the red-shirted hero, but more important, there now appeared the first
outlines of rivalry between a moderate, monarchist Italy and a revolutionary, republican
Italy. The danger of a rupture was averted by the good sense and magnanimity of Garibaldi
and by a diplomatic stratagem of Cavour. Cavour, taking up his stance before Europe as the
defender of law and order against revolutionary excesses, and before Napoleon as the
defender of the last strip of papal territory against attack by Garibaldi, sent an army under
Victor Emmanuel across Marche and Umbria in order to check the “hero of the two
worlds” and to weld the two Italies into one united kingdom.
There still remained the problem of establishing a capital. Cavour felt that only Rome
could be the capital of the new state; but that meant he had to face the most complex
problem of his life—that of the position to be assigned to the pope, the head of
Catholicism, once Rome had become the capital of Italy. Cavour wholeheartedly accepted
the concept of the separation of church and state; in his negotiations with the papacy he
became a passionate supporter of the idea. He maintained that the liberty of the church was
to be the fulcrum of the renewal of the world, even though this involved the renunciation of
its temporal power and the surrender of Rome to the Italian nation. An entirely spiritual
church and papacy, he asserted, would revive mankind. Pius IX’s answer to these proposals
was negative. But while Cavour was still vigorously promoting his formula of “a free
church in a free state,” he fell seriously ill and died, after having formed a nation in 10
years of impassioned and restless activity.

Piedmont, French Empire—died June 6, 1861, Turin, Italy), Piedmontese statesman, a conservative whose exploitation of international rivalries and of revolutionary movements brought about the unification of Italy (1861) under the House of Savoy, with himself as the first prime minister of the new kingdom. Family and early life The Cavours were an ancient family that had served the House of Savoy as soldiers and officials since the 16th century. Genevan by birth and Calvinist by religion, his mother brought into the Cavour family the influence of Geneva, a city open to all the political, religious, and social movements of the period. The French Revolution imperilled the fortunes of the Cavours because of their close ties with the ancien régime; but Cavour’s father, Michele, reestablished the family in an eminent position in Napoleonic society. Camillo even had as godparents Prince Camillo Borghese—after whom he was named— and Pauline Bonaparte, the Prince’s wife and Napoleon’s favourite sister. At the age of 10 he was enrolled at the Military Academy of Turin. As the younger son who could not hope for the economic and social position that would fall to his elder brother, Camillo saw a brilliant career open up before him under the protection of the court of Charles Albert, prince of Savoy and Piedmont. In 1826 he obtained a commission as lieutenant in the corps of engineers. During his six years at the academy political ideas began to fascinate him; echoes of the constitutionalist Piedmontese revolution of 1821 reached the school, provoking in some of its members a flash of liberal and national spirit that was, however, immediately extinguished. Among his family, Camillo heard the great issues of the day being discussed: the internal politics of France under the restored Bourbons; the revolt against Turkish repression in Greece; the liberal Decembrist rising in Russia in 1825. He showed his sympathy, in his usual enthusiastic manner, with the liberals and with personalities such as Benjamin Franklin and Santorre di Santarosa, the famous ill-fated leader of the 1821 revolution in Piedmont, who was also a distant relative. A close friendship with a cadet three years his senior, Baron Severino Cassio, seems to have had a particular influence on  Camillo Benso, count di Cavour   his political views. Cassio, suspected of republicanism, imbued Camillo with patriotic ideas. The Cavour family, greatly disturbed by their son’s association with a cadet holding compromising political views, ordered Camillo to terminate it—not without provoking his indignation and bitterness. This interference of the family was dictated by expediency, for in July 1824 the marchese Michele had obtained for Camillo the appointment as personal page to Charles Albert. His lack of enthusiasm for the court position and his open ridicule of the page-boy’s uniform he was obliged to wear caused a scandal and confirmed the growing suspicions about the rebellious disposition of the young count Cavour. The insulted Charles Albert banished Camillo from court and—vainly—tried to persuade King Charles Felix to strip Camillo of his commission. The episode created an irreparable break between Camillo and the hereditary prince and for about 20 years made it impossible for Cavour to take any part in official political life. Development of political ideals His military career began in the engineers. He was first stationed in Turin, then in various frontier posts, where fortifications were being constructed; yet, wherever he was, Cavour remained dissatisfied. In 1830 he was sent to Genoa, where he met Anna Giustiniani Schiaffino, an ardent advocate of ultrademocratic and republican ideas, whose salon was frequented by many members of the Carbonari, the secret revolutionary society whose guiding force then was Giuseppe Mazzini. Cavour’s fervent radicalism was inspired by his love for Anna Schiaffino and by his renewed friendship with Severino Cassio, now a fellow officer in the engineers at Genoa. The French revolution of July 1830, which overthrew the last Bourbon, Charles X, and installed Louis-Philippe, “the citizen king,” also played a great part in strengthening Cavour’s revolutionary ardour. Under the direction of Severino Cassio, he studied English in order to follow more easily the newspapers reporting political events in Europe. He was influenced by the liberal ideas of the French writers Benjamin Constant and François Guizot, and his adversaries remained those of his childhood: paternalistic absolutism; legitimist reactionaries representing the landed interests, the aristocracy, and the clergy; and the union of throne and altar. Of necessity this attitude pitted him consciously against the caste to which he belonged. The influence of the events in France on the temperamental Cavour once again aroused official suspicions, and this time he was subjected to police surveillance. As usual, his  Camillo Benso, count di Cavour   father’s intervention helped to avert more serious consequences; in this case he was simply transferred to a remote mountain fort. It had become obvious, however, that he could no longer remain in the army, from which he resigned in 1831. His father found him a sort of occupation: he was appointed mayor of a village south of Turin and also became the administrator of extensive holdings in the vicinity belonging to his uncles. Although these modest occupations served to fill his time and to insulate him from his family, they aggravated his despondency over what appeared to be the end of his political ambitions. Social interests began to absorb him: the problems of poverty and of prisoner education became the subjects of his researches. In 1834 he wrote a memoir on poverty in Piedmont, which was published the following year in London in the Report from His Majesty’s Commissioners for inquiring into the Administration and practical Operation of the Poor Laws. A second pamphlet on the history of the Poor Laws in England was edited and published by Cavour in 1835 at Turin. During those years he was at last able to make his first long-awaited visit to Paris and London, thus widening his knowledge of Europe. He now came to know the two greatest and most advanced Western capitals—both ruled by constitutional and liberal regimes (however much they differed in character) and both attempting to effect the boldest economic and social changes. He took a feverishly active interest in the parliamentary life of England and France; he attended university lectures and visited factories, railways, ports, hospitals, schools, and prisons. The experience he acquired in the two Western capitals and in Geneva set him firmly on the path he had already instinctively chosen: always to follow the “golden mean.” He was repelled equally by the revolutionaries who wished to destroy society through terror in order to construct a better one without realizing that their methods would defile human dignity, and by the reactionaries, who, in blindly opposing all progress, eventually provoked revolutionary uprisings. Rejecting all extremes, he wanted above all to be a good European. Yet Cavour always remained a patriot. When his worth and his great ambition were acknowledged in France and one of his friends invited him to abandon the petty and wretched Piedmont of Charles Albert for a brilliant career in France, Cavour rejected the invitation. In 1835, after his return from his travels, he began to engage in a fruitful series of enterprises that helped him to accumulate a considerable fortune. He also achieved a certain reputation with his writing. Even without directly facing the question of Italy’s future political structure, all his writings proclaimed social or economic principles that could in no way be reconciled with the prevailing conditions in Italy. Above all, the  Camillo Benso, count di Cavour   economic measures and the construction of railroads proposed by Cavour would have transformed the Italy of that period beyond recognition. Statesman Gradually, as the year 1848 drew near and the first gusts of the great revolutionary storm of that year could be felt, Cavour’s interest in politics began once more to dominate all others. This is shown by the chronological sequence of his writings. His transition to politics was completed when King Charles Albert decided to embark on measures of reform and to concede a certain amount of freedom to the press. Cavour took advantage of this to found the newspaper Il Risorgimento, which soon became the champion of increasingly drastic reforms. After taking a leading part in persuading Charles Albert to grant a liberal constitution, Cavour used Il Risorgimento to propagate the idea of an immediate war with Austria (which still ruled Lombardy and Venetia) as a historical necessity. Once elected a member of Parliament in June 1848, however, he assumed an intermediate position between the conservatives and the revolutionaries, thus calling forth the enmity of both left and right. The war against Austria was undertaken, but developments went against the Piedmontese. This prompted Cavour to offer his services as a volunteer until, on being elected a deputy in the third Legislature (July 1848), he began to fight for the approval of a peace treaty with Austria, although the extremists of the left wanted to continue a war that was, in effect, already lost. The intelligence and expertise he displayed in the debates on financial and military questions gained him a prominent place among the deputies of the majority that supported the right-wing government of Massimo d’Azeglio. In October 1850, he was offered the post of minister of agriculture and soon became the most active and influential member of the Cabinet. Through a series of treaties with France, Belgium, and England, Cavour attempted to bring about the greatest possible amount of free trade. He also sought to form a network of economic interests with the great powers to pave the way for a political alliance against Austria. His appointment as minister of finance in 1850 was evidence of his growing ambitions. Cavour now sought to create an alliance between the centre right and the centre left that would form a new majority with greater ability to move toward a policy of secularization and modernization in Piedmont. The alliance, called the connubio (“marriage”), brought about the resignation of d’Azeglio, whose parliamentary standing had been completely  Camillo Benso, count di Cavour   destroyed. After vain attempts to restore an effective d’Azeglio ministry, Victor Emmanuel II, who had succeeded his father Charles Albert in 1849, resigned himself to entrusting the formation of a government to Cavour, who from that time (Nov. 4, 1852) until his death was his country’s acknowledged political leader. The European drama into which Cavour was drawn against his will began in 1854 with the Crimean War (1853–56), which saw France and England allied against Russia in order to defend the integrity of the Turkish territory threatened by Russia’s determination to open the Dardanelles for passage from the Black Sea to the Mediterranean. Victor Emmanuel immediately pledged his help to the French and English representatives. Cavour, whose ministers voted against the Crimean venture, was on the point of being dismissed by the King if he rejected the alliance or of being forced to resign by his colleagues if he accepted it. Accepting the alliance with customary boldness and self-confidence, he averted dismissal by the King and embarked upon war. The turning point of the war came with the Anglo-French-Sardinian victory that persuaded Austria to cast aside its neutrality and, by means of an ultimatum, force Russia to make peace. With some difficulty, Cavour secured the participation of the small power of Piedmont in the peace negotiations at the Congress of Paris (1856), at which the greatest European powers were represented. By supporting Napoleon III’s undeclared yet obvious intention to intervene militarily in Italy in the near future and by taking advantage of the general animosity toward Austria, which had joined the allies in the Crimean War only when victory over Russia was assured, Cavour succeeded in proposing the discussion of the Italian problem on the grounds that it was one that threatened European peace. In his view, peace was threatened by Austrian encroachment, papal misgovernment in central Italy, and the autocratic rule of the Spanish Bourbons in southern Italy. Thus, for the first time, the Italian question was presented for diplomatic consideration in a manner favouring the liberation of the peninsula. The difficulty was to persuade the two great powers, France and England, to persevere in their support of an anti-Austrian policy on the part of Piedmont. In Paris, Cavour had occasion to meet and appraise the stature of Europe’s most capable diplomats and to examine the reasons behind the policies of the great powers. He knew full well that it was illusory to hope for the disinterested assistance of Europe in the Italian cause; nevertheless, with his tireless energy and unlimited capacity to take advantage of the most adverse situations, he finally succeeded in winning Napoleon III over to his side.

Carlo Cattaneo
Carlo Cattaneo, (born June 15, 1801, Milan—died
Feb. 6, 1869, near Lugano, Switz.), Italian publicist
and intellectual whose writings significantly shaped
the Risorgimento and whose journal, Il Politecnico
(“The Polytechnic”), not only served as a vehicle for
his political views but also was influential in
introducing new scientific and technical
improvements into Italy.
During Cattaneo’s early career as a schoolmaster and as a graduate in law at the University
of Padua (1824), he acquired a tremendous scope of knowledge: his writings treat such
diversified subjects as literature and fine arts, philosophy, language, mathematics,
chemistry, geology, agriculture, and penal reform, as well as various other economic,
social, and political problems of his time. Considered Italy’s first proponent of positivism,
he tried to clarify the complex relations between morality and economics. His important
scholarly work Notizie naturali e civili su la Lombardia (1844; “Natural and Civil Reports
on Lombardy”) gained him election to the prestigious Lombard Institute.
Cattaneo was slow to enter the political sphere, in which he was considered a moderate,
because he believed Italy was not ready for an armed revolt against Austria, which then
controlled Milan. When the Milan rebellion, “the Five Days” (March 18–22, 1848), broke
out, he became one of the leaders of the revolutionary council. On the reoccupation of
Milan by the Austrians in August, Cattaneo left and settled in Switzerland. He wrote two
books on the revolt: L’insurrection de Milan en 1848 (1848; “The Milan Insurrection of
1848”) and Dell’insurrezione di Milano nel 1848 e della successiva guerra (1849; “On the
Milan Insurrection of 1848 and on the Succeeding War”).
Cattaneo returned to Milan in 1859 to refound his journal. In 1867 he was elected to the
Chamber of Deputies of the Kingdom of Italy but never took his seat because he was
unwilling to take a required oath of loyalty to the ruling House of Savoy. He continued to
oppose the monarchy from his home in Switzerland.

Carlo Poerio
Carlo Poerio, (born Oct. 13, 1803, Naples—died April 28, 1867, Florence), Italian
revolutionary, distinguished for his services to liberalism during the Risorgimento.
The son of the Neapolitan lawyer and liberal Baron Giuseppe Poerio and the brother of the
poet and soldier Alessandro Poerio, Carlo shared in the exiles of his family from Naples by
the Bourbons; and, when he returned to Naples in 1833, he was an object of constant
suspicion, though he was careful to play no part in politics. He was arrested in 1837, 1844,
and 1847. In the Revolution of 1848 he helped to formulate the demands of the
constitutionalists and then became at first director of police and afterward minister of
education in the Liberal government. After his resignation in May 1848 he led the
constitutional opposition. He was again arrested in July 1849 but was not tried until
February 1851, when he was sentenced with his fellow Liberals to 24 years in irons. The
illegality of the trials, the atrocious sentences, and the sufferings of the prisoners horrified
the visiting English politician William Ewart Gladstone, who denounced the conditions of
the Neapolitan prisons in his two Letters to Lord Aberdeen (July 1851) and so made
Poerio’s case notorious throughout Europe. Poerio was not released until January 1859 and
then made his way to London.
After the outbreak of war between Sardinia–Piedmont and Austria, he went to Turin. He
served as a deputy in the Parliament of the new Kingdom of Italy (1861) but later refused a
governmental portfolio.

Carlos Manuel de Céspedes, in full Carlos Manuel
Perfecto del Carmen Céspedes y López del
Castillo, (born April 18, 1819, Bayamo, Cuba—died
February 27, 1874, San Lorenzo), Cuban
revolutionary hero. Although his revolution failed,
Céspedes started the Ten Years’ War (1868–78),
which ultimately led to Cuban independence.
Céspedes was born into a prominent plantation family who had been granted their Cuban
estate in 1517. After receiving his baccalaureate from Havana (1840), Céspedes completed
his law studies in Spain. While in Spain he took part (1843) in the revolution led by Juan
Prim, for which he was exiled to France. Upon his return to Cuba, Céspedes started a law
practice, wrote poems and pamphlets, and secretly organized an independence movement.
By 1868 Céspedes was made chief of the revolutionary movement in the Oriente region,
and on October 10, 1868, Céspedes, at the head of only 147 poorly armed men, proclaimed
independence for Cuba in the Grito de Yara (“Cry of Yara”). The insurrection gained
momentum and, by the end of the month, had 12,000 volunteers and scored some stunning
military successes. Céspedes, who favoured the gradual emancipation of the slaves,
allowed them to join the rebel army only with their owners’ permission.
The slaves were emancipated by a new constitution adopted in April 1869, the same month
that Céspedes was elected president by the revolutionary government. Spanish troops
poured into Cuba, and the earlier victories were followed by defeats and retreats. Céspedes’
government lost prestige, and his ambivalent stand on slavery angered both conservatives
and liberals. A Cuban tribunal deposed him in absentia (1873), and he was forced into
hiding; he was finally discovered and shot by Spanish soldiers, and his body was buried in
a common grave. In 1910 his remains were exhumed and placed in the National Pantheon
of Heroes of the Cuban Revolution in Havana. His son, Carlos Manuel Céspedes Quesada,
was briefly president of Cuba in 1933.

Celâl Bayar
Celâl Bayar, (born May 15, 1882/83, Umurbey, near Bursa, Ottoman Empire [now in
Turkey]—died Aug. 22, 1986, Istanbul), third president of the Turkish Republic (1950–60),
who initiated etatism, or a state-directed economy, in Turkey in the 1930s and who after
1946, as the leader of the Democrat Party, advocated a policy of private enterprise.
The son of a mufti (Muslim jurist), Bayar attended a French school operated by the
Alliance Israélite Universelle in Bursa, where he studied economics and finance. He then
worked for the Bursa branch of the Deutsche Orient Bank. After the Young Turk
Revolution of 1908, he became the secretary of the Smyrna branch of the Committee of
Union and Progress directed against Sultan Abdülhamid’s autocratic rule. Following the
collapse of the Ottoman Empire at the end of World War I, he joined the movement of
Mustafa Kemal (later Atatürk) to resist the Allied occupation of Anatolia, organizing the
national forces in the Smyrna and Bursa regions in western Anatolia. In January 1920 he
was elected to the last Ottoman Parliament as deputy for Smyrna; when the Parliament was
suppressed and the British arrested the nationalists, he escaped to Ankara, where Mustafa
Kemal had convened the Grand National Assembly (GNA). Bayar served as minister of
economy (1921–22) in the government of the GNA and for a time (1922–24) as minister of
reconstruction and settlement for the new Turkish Republic. He resigned to form the Iş
(Work) Bank.
In 1932 Bayar, an exponent of a state-operated economy, became the minister of economy
and contributed to the development of Turkey’s industries and mines. In 1937 he became
prime minister but resigned in January 1939 after Atatürk’s death.
In 1945 Bayar resigned from Parliament and also from the Republican People’s Party of
Atatürk. In January 1946, with Adnan Menderes, Mehmed Fuad Köprülü, and Refik
Koraltan, he helped organize the opposition Democrat Party, which won 62 seats in the
general election of July 1946. Under Bayar’s leadership the party won an overwhelming
victory at the election of May 14, 1950, and he was elected president by the new
Parliament. He was twice reelected (1954, 1957). Bayar was the architect of the
government’s economic policy, which gave priority to private enterprise and limited the
state’s functions to regulating and coordinating the forces participating in the economy.
Arrested during the military coup d’état of May 27, 1960, he was subsequently tried, along
with other leaders of the Democrat Party, on dubious charges of crimes against the state

Cesare, Count Balbo
Cesare, Count Balbo, (born November 27, 1789, Turin, Piedmont [Italy]—died June 3,
1853, Turin), Piedmontese political writer, a liberal but cautious constitutionalist who was
influential during the Italian Risorgimento and served as the first prime minister of
Sardinia-Piedmont under the constitution of March 5, 1848.
Balbo grew up while Piedmont was annexed to France and began his career by entering the
Napoleonic bureaucracy, wherein he acquired a wide knowledge of Italy. When the house
of Savoy was restored to the kingdom of Sardinia in 1814, Balbo’s service to Napoleon was
held against him; although he had little respect for the regime of Victor Emmanuel I and
was friendly with liberals in Turin, he disapproved of revolution and remained loyal to the
dynasty. Nevertheless, he fell into official disgrace because of his association with some
leaders of the revolution in March 1821 and his attempt to persuade the future king Charles
Albert to lead the constitutionalist movement. Balbo left Turin for several years and
devoted himself to writing.
Balbo’s most famous book, Delle speranze d’Italia (1844; “The Hopes of Italy”), showed
the antirevolutionary nature of his patriotism and liberalism. He wrote that the
independence of Italy from Austria was desirable, but Austria should be compensated with
territory in the Balkans; that the interests of the papacy should be safeguarded; and that a
confederation might be the best political organization for Italy. In Lettere di politica e
letteratura edite ed inedite (1847), Balbo called for a specifically moderate Italian party.
Encouraged by Charles Albert’s grant of the constitutional statuto in 1848, Balbo accepted
the office of prime minister on March 13. Alarmed by the democratic agitation in Italy, he
resigned in July 1848, later served as Piedmontese emissary to Pope Pius IX, and refused
the premiership in 1852.

Chaim Weizmann
Chaim Weizmann
Chaim Weizmann, in full Chaim Azriel Weizmann,
(born Nov. 27, 1874, Motol, Pol., Russian Empire
[now in Belarus]—died Nov. 9, 1952, Reḥovot,
Israel), first president of the new nation of Israel
(1949–52), who was for decades the guiding spirit
behind the World Zionist Organization.
Early life and education
Chaim Azriel Weizmann was born of humble parents in November 1874, in Motol, a
backwater hamlet in the western Russian empire, the third of 15 children of Ezer
Weizmann, a lumber transporter. Motol lay close to dense forests, surroundings that
instilled in the boy a love of trees that was to persist the rest of his life. He spent adolescent
summers riding his father’s log rafts downriver to Baltic ports.
Despite slender means, the parents arranged for their offspring to receive the benefits of
advanced education after strict Jewish orthodox schooling in childhood. All except one of
the children ultimately became scientists, physicians, dentists, engineers, and pedagogues.
Chaim himself, on reaching 11, was sent to the secondary school in nearby Pinsk, where
his unusual scientific aptitude was encouraged by a discerning science master.
Upon matriculating (1891), the young student, irked by university quotas restricting Jewish
admissions, left Russia to study chemistry in Germany and Switzerland, eking out small
remittances from home by teaching science and Russian. After obtaining the Ph.D. magna
cum laude at Fribourg, Switz. (1900), Weizmann taught chemistry at Geneva University
and concurrently engaged in organic chemistry research, concentrating on dyestuffs and
aromatics. By selling several patented discoveries in the late 1890s, he mitigated his
chronic financial straits and was able to help his younger brothers and sisters through
college. In 1900 he met Vera Chatzman, a medical student, in Geneva, and six years later
they married; they had two sons.
Weizmann settled in England in 1904 upon taking up a science appointment at the
University of Manchester. During World War I he gave valuable assistance to the British
munitions industry, then (1916) in dire need of acetone (a vital ingredient of cordite), by
devising a process to extract the solvent from maize. This achievement signally aided the
Zionist political negotiations he was then conducting with the British government.

Although he gained international renown as a chemist, it was as a politician that he was
most eminent. As a youth he imbibed Jewish nationalist culture and ideals (as distinct from
traditional pietistic knowledge) under his father’s influence. At the age of 11 he wrote a
letter in Hebrew to his Hebrew teacher in Motol urging with boyish fervour that the Jewish
people must return to Zion.
Early political involvement
Throughout his student and teaching years he assumed increasing dominance as a Zionist
politician. He initially gained prominence as the leader of the “Young Zionist” opposition
to Theodor Herzl, the founder of modern Zionism, especially in the “Uganda dispute,”
which erupted in 1903–05 over a British proposal for Jewish agricultural settlement in East
Africa. Elected to the General Council (Actions Committee) in 1905, he played only a
secondary role in the movement until 1914. Then, during the early years of the war he took
an important part in the negotiations that led up to the government’s Balfour Declaration
(November 1917) favouring the establishment of a Jewish national home in Palestine.
While in Jerusalem he travelled to ʿAqaba, southern Transjordan (June 1918), where he
met Amīr Fayṣal of Hejaz (later first king of Iraq) to discuss Jewish–Arab cooperation.
They met again and reached written agreement during the Versailles peace conference (July
1919). As an observer, Weizmann attended the San Remo conference of Allied Powers
(1920), which confirmed the Balfour Declaration and awarded the Palestine Mandate to
Great Britain. The same year, Weizmann, who had been president of the English Zionist
Federation from 1917, became head of the World Zionist Organization. From 1921 onward
he travelled the world tirelessly, preaching Zionist ideology and appealing for funds at
mass rallies.
Weizmann’s skill as a negotiator was severely tested during the 1920s. Great Britain,
confronted by the mounting problems and civil disorders stemming from nascent Arab
nationalism, gradually retreated from its commitment to foster a Jewish national home. A
dauntless protagonist, Weizmann nevertheless plunged into the ceaseless imbroglios of
British policy vacillations, Arab and Jewish revolts, and Zionist internecine feuds and
conflicts that were commingled with opposition to himself by adversaries.
Conflict with Zionist extremists
Eventually, Weizmann’s doctrines of caution antagonized extremist politicians. Exasperated
by counsels of gradualism, some Zionists accused him of undue amenability toward Britain
in his political thinking and performance—a characteristic they averred he owed to the

genteel influences of the upper English society in which he moved. His control over the
world nationalist movement was challenged after Britain announced policy changes
unfavourable to Zionist work in Palestine. He therefore resigned in pique in 1930 but was
prevailed upon to remain in office. At the 1931 congress, however, he was subjected to a
vote of nonconfidence and was not reelected president of the Zionist Organization and
Jewish Agency, the expanded body of which he had been the main architect in 1929.
Weizmann turned again to science, founding the Daniel Sieff Research Institute at Reḥovot,
Palestine (1934), with the help of friends in England. Earlier, he had toured South Africa
(1931) and played a leading part in public efforts to save German Jewry and its property
after the advent of the Nazis (1933).
Back in office by election (1935), Weizmann supported the recommendation of a British
royal inquiry commission (1937) to divide Palestine into Jewish and Arab areas, arguing
that “half a loaf was better than none.” Opponents furiously challenged this expedience as
pusillanimity and craven submission to British interests, though in the end the
commission’s plan failed because of Arab rather than Jewish rejection.
Weizmann’s unflagging insistence during World War II brought about the formation of the
Jewish Brigade Group in the British army. The Sieff Research Institute under his direction
also aided the Allied military effort by providing essential pharmaceuticals, and Weizmann
conferred with the United States and British governments on methods of producing
synthetic rubber. His younger son, Michael, was killed in 1942 while serving as an officer
in the Royal Air Force.
Zionist antagonists revived allegations of Weizmann’s pro-British prejudice after he had
denounced (1945) on moral grounds the violent campaign waged by Jewish dissident
groups against British forces in Palestine. He again lost the world Zionist presidency
(1946) and never returned to the official leadership. Nevertheless, Jewish people as a whole
continued to revere him.
President of Israel
Early in 1948, though divested of formal office, he was sent to Washington by the Zionist
leadership for crucial talks with Pres. Harry Truman. Weizmann persuaded the United
States administration both to drop its trusteeship plan for Palestine—a plan that would have
jeopardized founding the State of Israel—and to forego its proposal to exclude Palestine’s
southern province (Negev) from Israel. His intervention also led to American recognition
of the newly proclaimed state (May 14) and the grant of a $100,000,000 loan. That

Chandrasekhar Azad
Chandrasekhar Azad, original name Chandrasekhar Tiwari, Chandrasekhar also spelled
Chandrashekhar or Chandra Shekhar, (born July 23, 1906, Bhabra, India—died
February 27, 1931, Allahabad), Indian revolutionary who organized and led a band of
militant youth during India’s independence movement.
Azad was drawn into the Indian national movement at a young age. When apprehended by
the police at age 15 while participating in Mohandas K. Gandhi’s noncooperation
movement (1920–22) at Banares (now Varanasi), he gave his name as Azad (Urdu: “Free”
or “Liberated”) and his address as “prison.” Although because of his age he was not
imprisoned, he was given a severe flogging by the police. The Indian National Congress
(Congress Party) soon lionized him, and he gained popularity among the Indian people.
Azad was disappointed by Gandhi’s suspension of the noncooperation movement in
February 1922, after several policemen had been murdered by a revolutionary mob at
Chauri Chaura. Joining the radical Hindustan Republican Association (HRA), Azad
participated in several violent crimes, notably the Kakori train robbery (1925) and the
revenge killing of a British police officer (1928).
Known for his organizational skills, Azad played a key role in reorganizing the HRA as the
Hindustan Socialist Republican Association after most of the HRA’s members had been
killed or imprisoned. His crimes had made him a wanted man, but Azad was able to elude
the police and its informants for several years. According to Jawaharlal Nehru’s
autobiography, it was during this period of underground existence that Azad met Nehru in
early 1931 to enquire whether—under the discussions being held that resulted in the
signing of the Gandhi-Irwin Pact in March—the revolutionaries could expect a fair deal
leading to their honourable rehabilitation.
Determined never to be captured by police, Azad was constantly on the move. On February
27, 1931, Azad arranged to meet a revolutionary at Allahabad’s Alfred Park (now Azad
Park). He was betrayed to the police, who surrounded him as soon as he entered the park. A
gun battle ensued, in which two police officers were wounded, and Azad was fatally shot.

Charles Carroll
Charles Carroll, (born Sept. 19, 1737, Annapolis, Md.
[U.S.]—died Nov. 14, 1832, Baltimore, Md., U.S.),
American patriot leader, the longest- surviving signer of
the Declaration of Independence, and the only Roman
Catholic to sign that document.
Until 1765 Carroll attended Jesuit colleges in Maryland and France and studied law in
France and England. Before and during the American Revolution, he served on committees
of correspondence and in the Continental Congress (1776–78), where he was an important
member of the Board of War. In 1776, with Benjamin Franklin, Samuel Chase, and his
cousin, the Rev. John Carroll, he was sent to Canada in a fruitless effort to persuade
Canadians to join the cause of the 13 colonies. He was elected again to the Continental
Congress in 1780, but he decided not to serve.
Carroll was a state senator in Maryland (1777–1800) and concurrently a U.S. senator
(1789–92). He retired from the latter position when Maryland passed a law forbidding
members of the state senate to serve in the U.S. Congress. When political parties were
formed in the United States, Carroll became a Federalist. After leaving the state senate, he
lived a fairly quiet life, though he did participate in the forming of the Baltimore & Ohio
Railroad Company.

Charles de Gaulle
Charles de Gaulle, in full Charles André Joseph
Marie de Gaulle, (born November 22, 1890, Lille,
France—died November 9, 1970, Colombey-les-
deux-Églises), French soldier, writer, statesman, and
architect of France’s Fifth Republic.
Education and early career
De Gaulle was the second son of a Roman Catholic, patriotic, and nationalist upper-middle-
class family. The family had produced historians and writers, and his father taught
philosophy and literature; but, as a boy, de Gaulle already showed a passionate interest in
military matters. He attended the Military Academy of Saint-Cyr, and in 1913, as a young
second lieutenant, he joined an infantry regiment commanded by Colonel Philippe Pétain.
De Gaulle was an intelligent, hardworking, and zealous young soldier and, in his military
career, a man of original mind, great self-assurance, and outstanding courage. In World War
I he fought at Verdun, was three times wounded and three times mentioned in dispatches,
and spent two years and eight months as a prisoner of war (during which time he made five
unsuccessful attempts to escape). After a brief visit to Poland as a member of a military
mission, a year’s teaching at Saint-Cyr, and a two-year course of special training in strategy
and tactics at the École Supérieure de Guerre (War College), he was promoted by Marshal
Pétain in 1925 to the staff of the Supreme War Council. From 1927 to 1929 de Gaulle
served as a major in the army occupying the Rhineland and could see for himself both the
potential danger of German aggression and the inadequacy of the French defense. He also
spent two years in the Middle East and then, having been promoted to lieutenant colonel,
spent four years as a member of the secretariat of the National Defense Council.
De Gaulle’s writing career began with a study of the relations between the civil and
military powers in Germany (La Discorde chez l’ennemi, 1924; “Discord Among the
Enemy”), followed by lectures on his conception of leadership, Le Fil de l’épée (1932; The
Edge of the Sword). A study on military theory, Vers l’armée de métier (1934; The Army of
the Future), defended the idea of a small professional army, highly mechanized and mobile,
in preference to the static theories exemplified by the Maginot Line, which was intended to
protect France against German attack. He also wrote a memorandum in which he tried,
even as late as January 1940, to convert politicians to his way of thinking. His views made

him unpopular with his military superiors, and the question of his right to publish under his
name a historical study, La France et son armée (1938; France and Her Army), led to a
dispute with Marshal Pétain.
World War II
At the outbreak of World War II, de Gaulle commanded a tank brigade attached to the
French Fifth Army. In May 1940, after assuming command as temporary brigadier general
in the 4th Armoured Division—the rank that he retained for the rest of his life—he twice
had the opportunity to apply his theories on tank warfare. He was mentioned as “an
admirable, energetic, and courageous leader.” On June 6 he entered the government of Paul
Reynaud as undersecretary of state for defense and war, and he undertook several missions
to England to explore the possibilities of continuing the war. When the Reynaud
government was replaced 10 days later by that of Marshal Pétain, who intended to seek an
armistice with the Germans, de Gaulle left for England. On June 18 he broadcast from
London his first appeal to his compatriots to continue the war under his leadership. On
August 2, 1940, a French military court tried and sentenced him in absentia to death,
deprivation of military rank, and confiscation of property.
De Gaulle entered his wartime career as a political leader with tremendous liabilities. He
had only a handful of haphazardly recruited political supporters and volunteers for what
were to become the Free French Forces. He had no political status and was virtually
unknown in both Britain and France. But he had an absolute belief in his mission and a
conviction that he possessed the qualities of leadership. He was totally devoted to France
and had the strength of character (or obstinacy, as it often appeared to the British) to fight
for French interests as he saw them with all the resources at his disposal.
In his country, to the politicians on the political left, a career officer who was a practicing
Roman Catholic was not an immediately acceptable political leader, while to those on the
right he was a rebel against Pétain, who was a national hero and France’s only field
marshal. Broadcasts from London, the action of the Free French Forces, and the contacts of
resistance groups in France either with de Gaulle’s own organization or with those of the
British secret services brought national recognition of his leadership; but full recognition
by his allies came only after the liberation of Paris in August 1944.
In London de Gaulle’s relations with the British government were never easy, and de
Gaulle often added to the strain, at times through his own misjudgment or touchiness. In
1943 he moved his headquarters to Algiers, where he became president of the French

Henri Giraud, Franklin D.
Roosevelt, Charles de Gaulle,
and Winston Churchill;
Casablanca Conference
Committee of National Liberation, at first jointly with
General Henri Giraud. De Gaulle’s successful
campaign to edge out Giraud gave the world proof of
his skill in political maneuvering.
Early political career
On September 9, 1944, de Gaulle and his shadow
government returned from Algiers to Paris. There he
headed two successive provisional governments, but
on January 20, 1946, he abruptly resigned, apparently
because of his irritation with the political parties forming the coalition government.
In November 1946 the Fourth French Republic was declared, and until 1958 de Gaulle
campaigned against its constitution, which, he charged, was likely to reproduce the political
and governmental inadequacies of the Third Republic. In 1947 he formed the Rally of the
French People (Rassemblement du Peuple Français; RPF), a mass movement that grew
rapidly in strength and that to all intents and purposes became a political party during the
elections of 1951, when it won 120 seats in the National Assembly. The movement
expressed de Gaulle’s hostility to the constitution, to the party system, and, in particular, to
the French Communists, because of their unswerving loyalty to directives from Moscow.
He became dissatisfied with the RPF, however, and in 1953 severed his connection with it.
In 1955 it was disbanded.
The general made no public appearances in 1955–56 and retired to his home in Colombey-
les-deux-Églises, where he worked on his memoirs: L’Appel, 1940–1942 (1954; The Call
to Honour, 1940–1942), L’Unité, 1942–1944 (1956; Unity, 1942–1944), and Le Salut,
1944–1946 (1959; Salvation, 1944–1946). The last volume was completed only after his
return to power in 1958.
Return to public life
De Gaulle’s compatriots were deeply divided on the question of his return to public life.
The reasons for their hesitation belong to the political history of the period. The
opportunity presented itself in May 1958 when the insurrection that had broken out in
Algiers threatened to bring civil war to France. De Gaulle must have seen his return to
politics as the most carefully balanced calculation in a life that had had its share of political
gambles. He was cautious, for it was by no means certain that the French parliament would
accept his return on conditions that he could accept. He affirmed his determination not to

come to power by other than legal means, and there was never any evidence of his
association with insurgent plans to bring him back; however, his carefully worded
statements (on May 15, 19, and 27) certainly helped the insurgents. On June 1, three days
after President René Coty threatened to resign unless de Gaulle’s return to power was
accepted, de Gaulle presented himself before the National Assembly as a prime minister
designate. On the following day he attended the parliamentary session (after he was duly
invested as prime minister) that authorized him to reform the constitution and accorded him
the special powers that he demanded.
On December 21, 1958, de Gaulle was elected president of the republic. The powers given
to the president in the new constitution, which had been approved by referendum on
September 28, 1958, especially those providing for the use of the referendum and for
presidential rule during a state of emergency, reflected his firm conviction that a strong
state required a leader with the power to make decisions. De Gaulle realized that his fellow
citizens would accept him only in a crisis and that he must, therefore, take steps to retain
the support of the general public and to disarm the power of “the system of parties” in
parliament, always potentially hostile to him. His tactics were first to obtain consent for the
personal control of government policy by the president and then to ensure its renewal
through elections or referenda. He therefore undertook throughout his presidency what was
virtually a continuous election campaign in the form of provincial tours, in which he visited
every département and during which he met ordinary citizens as well as local notables. He
appeared on television several times a year. He relied as far as possible on ministers who
were compagnons—those whose loyalties went back to the wartime days—and counted on
their use of the constitutional provisions to curb the powers of the deputies to obstruct
parliamentary business or harass governments.
De Gaulle retained the essential function of parliaments in a democracy—namely, the right
to criticize governments and to withdraw confidence in them. There were frequent
complaints of progovernmental bias on the radio, but these also had been common under
pre-Gaullist regimes. Under a law of 1881, insults to the president of the republic constitute
an offense, and, while there was certainly more recourse to this law during de Gaulle’s
presidency than under previous regimes, it presented no obstacle to political criticisms of
Gaullist policies and Gaullist ministers in the press and by political parties. Indeed, those
criticisms were continual and widespread.
De Gaulle’s greatest challenge in his early years as president was to find a way to resolve
the bloody and extraordinarily divisive Algerian War. France’s influential left-wing

intellectuals supported Algerian independence and wanted de Gaulle to find a face-saving
way to end the war quickly. The European residents of Algeria and their many supporters
on the mainland, most of them politically conservative, wanted France to retain Algeria at
all costs. The leaders of the Algerian National Liberation Front (FLN), meanwhile, were
willing to discuss nothing short of full independence. De Gaulle realized that he had no
choice but to end the war, and, when he began peace negotiations with the FLN, French
military leaders in Algiers turned against him, forming a rebel faction known as the Secret
Army Organization (OAS).
In April 1961 the OAS seized control of Algiers and threatened to take Paris as well. De
Gaulle responded vigorously, using the emergency powers permitted by the constitution of
the Fifth Republic. Most French citizens rallied to de Gaulle, and after a tense standoff the
OAS action fell apart. The bulk of the military refused to side with the rebellious generals,
and de Gaulle’s peace initiative was allowed to proceed. The bloodletting, however, was
not over. The OAS, now a full-fledged terrorist organization, undertook a wave of
bombings and assassinations (including attempts on de Gaulle) that left some 12,000
victims. But the overwhelming majority of the population supported de Gaulle, allowing
him to negotiate Algerian independence (1962) and defeat the OAS.
Having been preoccupied with Algeria during his first three years, de Gaulle was finally in
a position to turn to other pressing matters. Beginning in 1962, he moved to strengthen the
country’s economy, planned the reorganization of the army, developed an independent
nuclear deterrent, and prevented fresh “Algerias” in the future by providing for the
constitutional transformation of the African overseas territories into 12 politically
independent states. From mid-1962 onward, however, with the recognition of an
independent Algerian state, he had to consolidate his own position by obtaining a fresh vote
of confidence from the electorate, for he was no longer politically indispensable.
One lesson that de Gaulle had learned was that his personal position was stronger if he
remained, at least in theory, above the political and party battle, as he had tried to do during
the wartime and early postwar years. Before the elections of 1958, he had therefore
forbidden his supporters to use his name, “even in the form of an adjective,” in the title of
any group or candidate. In 1962 he offered the electors the choice between his resignation
and acceptance of a constitutional amendment providing for the election of the president by
universal suffrage. Under the original constitution, the president was to be chosen by an
electoral college of some 80,000 members, mainly mayors and local leaders. The electors
favoured the amendment overwhelmingly. During the parliamentary general election in

November, the Gaullist party won an additional 64 seats, thus obtaining, with the support
of some 30 conservative deputies, a majority in the National Assembly. From then on, de
Gaulle was in a position to carry out, with public consent, the plans that he regarded as
essential in restoring France to the status of a great power.
As a statesman, de Gaulle fought his political battles like a military campaign, using all the
devices that he had learned to transform France’s postwar international position of
weakness into one of strength and to overcome opposition to his plans at home. These
devices have been often described by his fellow citizens: “egoism, pride, aloofness, guile,”
according to sociologist and historian Raymond Aron; “empiricism, intuition, flexibility of
mind if not of soul,” according to one of the most perceptive of his biographers, Jean
Lacouture.
From 1962 until his reelection as president in 1965, de Gaulle used the European Economic
Community (EEC; now part of the European Union) to serve French interests, especially
agricultural interests. France’s participation in the supranational North Atlantic Treaty
Organization (NATO) was progressively withdrawn, because de Gaulle’s policy for France
was one of “national independence” and of international cooperation based only on
agreements between nation-states. This was the main theme of his presidential campaign in
1965. On December 21 he was reelected, though only on the second ballot, after facing a
surprisingly strong challenge from the Socialist Franƈois Mitterrand. On March 7, 1966, de
Gaulle announced France’s withdrawal from the integrated military command of NATO but
not from the alliance.
During the remainder of his second term as president, de Gaulle turned his attention
increasingly to wider fields. He had already begun a policy of “détente and cooperation”
with countries behind the Iron Curtain by encouraging trade and cultural relations with the
Soviet Union and the countries of eastern Europe and by recognizing the People’s Republic
of China in January 1964. As a solution for the Vietnam War, he advocated a policy of
neutrality for all nations concerned, based on a negotiated peace of which a necessary
preliminary was to be the withdrawal of all U.S. troops from Vietnam. These activities,
together with visits to Canada, the Far East, and all of Latin America, formed part of a
policy that aimed at increasing the influence of France, first in French-speaking countries
or countries that shared some bond derived from a common attachment to Latin culture,
then in Europe, which, in his view, would sooner or later extend beyond the boundaries of
the EEC or the division into Western and Eastern blocs, and finally in the world, where he
foresaw the gradual dissolution of the two great blocs.

Circumstances worked against his success. He felt obliged to take up attitudes that were
generally interpreted as anti-American. His theory of “desatellization,” the progressive
loosening of the Soviet hold on the countries of eastern Europe, was brutally invalidated by
the Soviet invasion of Czechoslovakia in 1968. Moreover, there was no evidence that
France carried any real weight with the countries that it hoped to influence. As the political
and economic crisis of May 1968 revealed, France had neither the internal cohesion nor the
financial resources to play the role of leader in what de Gaulle called “Europe from the
Atlantic to the Urals.”
His strength had been in his appeal for unity against a common enemy—in 1940, Germany;
in 1958, subversion and civil disorder. In the students’ and workers’ revolt of May 1968,
the enemy was once again subversion and civil disorder, but the rapid collapse of the revolt
and the divisions within the left that it revealed made de Gaulle seem less indispensable
than in the past. The solution to the underlying causes of the revolt required the patient
negotiation of a government rather than leadership by a man of destiny. A broadcast on
May 30 brought a massive demonstration of support and a landslide Gaullist victory in the
subsequent election, but the victory was for peace and normality rather than for the
president and his policies.
When in April 1969 de Gaulle called once again for a referendum, it was not clear whether
he really wanted to remain in power. The referendum, calling for the acceptance of regional
reorganization and a reform of the Senate, was presented to voters, as other referenda had
been, as a choice between acceptance of the measures (though the second was generally
unpopular) or of his own resignation. The diplomatic methods that had been welcomed
during his first term as assertions of France’s claim to equality with and influence among
the great powers now created great unease. His advocacy of neutrality on Vietnam in 1966
was widely interpreted as an expression of personal anti-Americanism. On his visit to
Canada in 1967, he seemed actively to encourage French Canadian separatism. His
declarations of neutrality in the 1967 Arab-Israeli war seemed to show a pro-Arab bias.
France had not formally withdrawn from NATO, and the so-called independent nuclear
deterrent that he sought was neither independent nor within France’s means. The question
“After de Gaulle, who?” was answered by the president himself when he dismissed
Georges Pompidou in 1968 after a record six years as prime minister. This left Pompidou
free to present himself as a credible and acceptable successor to de Gaulle.
On April 28, 1969, following his defeat in the referendum, de Gaulle resigned and returned
to Colombey-les-deux-Églises to retire permanently and to resume writing his memoirs.

There he died of a heart attack the following year. His aims and actions as president have
drawn more exegesis and speculation than those of any other French statesman.

Education and early career De Gaulle was the second son of a Roman Catholic, patriotic, and nationalist upper-middle- class family. The family had produced historians and writers, and his father taught philosophy and literature; but, as a boy, de Gaulle already showed a passionate interest in military matters. He attended the Military Academy of Saint-Cyr, and in 1913, as a young second lieutenant, he joined an infantry regiment commanded by Colonel Philippe Pétain. De Gaulle was an intelligent, hardworking, and zealous young soldier and, in his military career, a man of original mind, great self-assurance, and outstanding courage. In World War I he fought at Verdun, was three times wounded and three times mentioned in dispatches, and spent two years and eight months as a prisoner of war (during which time he made five unsuccessful attempts to escape). After a brief visit to Poland as a member of a military mission, a year’s teaching at Saint-Cyr, and a two-year course of special training in strategy and tactics at the École Supérieure de Guerre (War College), he was promoted by Marshal Pétain in 1925 to the staff of the Supreme War Council. From 1927 to 1929 de Gaulle served as a major in the army occupying the Rhineland and could see for himself both the potential danger of German aggression and the inadequacy of the French defense. He also spent two years in the Middle East and then, having been promoted to lieutenant colonel, spent four years as a member of the secretariat of the National Defense Council. De Gaulle’s writing career began with a study of the relations between the civil and military powers in Germany (La Discorde chez l’ennemi, 1924; “Discord Among the Enemy”), followed by lectures on his conception of leadership, Le Fil de l’épée (1932; The Edge of the Sword). A study on military theory, Vers l’armée de métier (1934; The Army of the Future), defended the idea of a small professional army, highly mechanized and mobile, in preference to the static theories exemplified by the Maginot Line, which was intended to protect France against German attack. He also wrote a memorandum in which he tried, even as late as January 1940, to convert politicians to his way of thinking. His views made  Charles de Gaulle   him unpopular with his military superiors, and the question of his right to publish under his name a historical study, La France et son armée (1938; France and Her Army), led to a dispute with Marshal Pétain. World War II At the outbreak of World War II, de Gaulle commanded a tank brigade attached to the French Fifth Army. In May 1940, after assuming command as temporary brigadier general in the 4th Armoured Division—the rank that he retained for the rest of his life—he twice had the opportunity to apply his theories on tank warfare. He was mentioned as “an admirable, energetic, and courageous leader.” On June 6 he entered the government of Paul Reynaud as undersecretary of state for defense and war, and he undertook several missions to England to explore the possibilities of continuing the war. When the Reynaud government was replaced 10 days later by that of Marshal Pétain, who intended to seek an armistice with the Germans, de Gaulle left for England. On June 18 he broadcast from London his first appeal to his compatriots to continue the war under his leadership. On August 2, 1940, a French military court tried and sentenced him in absentia to death, deprivation of military rank, and confiscation of property. De Gaulle entered his wartime career as a political leader with tremendous liabilities. He had only a handful of haphazardly recruited political supporters and volunteers for what were to become the Free French Forces. He had no political status and was virtually unknown in both Britain and France. But he had an absolute belief in his mission and a conviction that he possessed the qualities of leadership. He was totally devoted to France and had the strength of character (or obstinacy, as it often appeared to the British) to fight for French interests as he saw them with all the resources at his disposal. In his country, to the politicians on the political left, a career officer who was a practicing Roman Catholic was not an immediately acceptable political leader, while to those on the right he was a rebel against Pétain, who was a national hero and France’s only field marshal. Broadcasts from London, the action of the Free French Forces, and the contacts of resistance groups in France either with de Gaulle’s own organization or with those of the British secret services brought national recognition of his leadership; but full recognition by his allies came only after the liberation of Paris in August 1944. In London de Gaulle’s relations with the British government were never easy, and de Gaulle often added to the strain, at times through his own misjudgment or touchiness. In 1943 he moved his headquarters to Algiers, where he became president of the French  Charles de Gaulle   Henri Giraud, Franklin D. Roosevelt, Charles de Gaulle, and Winston Churchill; Casablanca Conference Committee of National Liberation, at first jointly with General Henri Giraud. De Gaulle’s successful campaign to edge out Giraud gave the world proof of his skill in political maneuvering. Early political career On September 9, 1944, de Gaulle and his shadow government returned from Algiers to Paris. There he headed two successive provisional governments, but on January 20, 1946, he abruptly resigned, apparently because of his irritation with the political parties forming the coalition government. In November 1946 the Fourth French Republic was declared, and until 1958 de Gaulle campaigned against its constitution, which, he charged, was likely to reproduce the political and governmental inadequacies of the Third Republic. In 1947 he formed the Rally of the French People (Rassemblement du Peuple Français; RPF), a mass movement that grew rapidly in strength and that to all intents and purposes became a political party during the elections of 1951, when it won 120 seats in the National Assembly. The movement expressed de Gaulle’s hostility to the constitution, to the party system, and, in particular, to the French Communists, because of their unswerving loyalty to directives from Moscow. He became dissatisfied with the RPF, however, and in 1953 severed his connection with it. In 1955 it was disbanded. The general made no public appearances in 1955–56 and retired to his home in Colombey- les-deux-Églises, where he worked on his memoirs: L’Appel, 1940–1942 (1954; The Call to Honour, 1940–1942), L’Unité, 1942–1944 (1956; Unity, 1942–1944), and Le Salut, 1944–1946 (1959; Salvation, 1944–1946). The last volume was completed only after his return to power in 1958. Return to public life De Gaulle’s compatriots were deeply divided on the question of his return to public life. The reasons for their hesitation belong to the political history of the period. The opportunity presented itself in May 1958 when the insurrection that had broken out in Algiers threatened to bring civil war to France. De Gaulle must have seen his return to politics as the most carefully balanced calculation in a life that had had its share of political gambles. He was cautious, for it was by no means certain that the French parliament would accept his return on conditions that he could accept. He affirmed his determination not to  Charles de Gaulle   come to power by other than legal means, and there was never any evidence of his association with insurgent plans to bring him back; however, his carefully worded statements (on May 15, 19, and 27) certainly helped the insurgents. On June 1, three days after President René Coty threatened to resign unless de Gaulle’s return to power was accepted, de Gaulle presented himself before the National Assembly as a prime minister designate. On the following day he attended the parliamentary session (after he was duly invested as prime minister) that authorized him to reform the constitution and accorded him the special powers that he demanded. On December 21, 1958, de Gaulle was elected president of the republic. The powers given to the president in the new constitution, which had been approved by referendum on September 28, 1958, especially those providing for the use of the referendum and for presidential rule during a state of emergency, reflected his firm conviction that a strong state required a leader with the power to make decisions. De Gaulle realized that his fellow citizens would accept him only in a crisis and that he must, therefore, take steps to retain the support of the general public and to disarm the power of “the system of parties” in parliament, always potentially hostile to him. His tactics were first to obtain consent for the personal control of government policy by the president and then to ensure its renewal through elections or referenda. He therefore undertook throughout his presidency what was virtually a continuous election campaign in the form of provincial tours, in which he visited every département and during which he met ordinary citizens as well as local notables. He appeared on television several times a year. He relied as far as possible on ministers who were compagnons—those whose loyalties went back to the wartime days—and counted on their use of the constitutional provisions to curb the powers of the deputies to obstruct parliamentary business or harass governments. De Gaulle retained the essential function of parliaments in a democracy—namely, the right to criticize governments and to withdraw confidence in them. There were frequent complaints of progovernmental bias on the radio, but these also had been common under pre-Gaullist regimes. Under a law of 1881, insults to the president of the republic constitute an offense, and, while there was certainly more recourse to this law during de Gaulle’s presidency than under previous regimes, it presented no obstacle to political criticisms of Gaullist policies and Gaullist ministers in the press and by political parties. Indeed, those criticisms were continual and widespread. De Gaulle’s greatest challenge in his early years as president was to find a way to resolve the bloody and extraordinarily divisive Algerian War. France’s influential left-wing  Charles de Gaulle   intellectuals supported Algerian independence and wanted de Gaulle to find a face-saving way to end the war quickly. The European residents of Algeria and their many supporters on the mainland, most of them politically conservative, wanted France to retain Algeria at all costs. The leaders of the Algerian National Liberation Front (FLN), meanwhile, were willing to discuss nothing short of full independence. De Gaulle realized that he had no choice but to end the war, and, when he began peace negotiations with the FLN, French military leaders in Algiers turned against him, forming a rebel faction known as the Secret Army Organization (OAS). In April 1961 the OAS seized control of Algiers and threatened to take Paris as well. De Gaulle responded vigorously, using the emergency powers permitted by the constitution of the Fifth Republic. Most French citizens rallied to de Gaulle, and after a tense standoff the OAS action fell apart. The bulk of the military refused to side with the rebellious generals, and de Gaulle’s peace initiative was allowed to proceed. The bloodletting, however, was not over. The OAS, now a full-fledged terrorist organization, undertook a wave of bombings and assassinations (including attempts on de Gaulle) that left some 12,000 victims. But the overwhelming majority of the population supported de Gaulle, allowing him to negotiate Algerian independence (1962) and defeat the OAS. Having been preoccupied with Algeria during his first three years, de Gaulle was finally in a position to turn to other pressing matters. Beginning in 1962, he moved to strengthen the country’s economy, planned the reorganization of the army, developed an independent nuclear deterrent, and prevented fresh “Algerias” in the future by providing for the constitutional transformation of the African overseas territories into 12 politically independent states. From mid-1962 onward, however, with the recognition of an independent Algerian state, he had to consolidate his own position by obtaining a fresh vote of confidence from the electorate, for he was no longer politically indispensable. One lesson that de Gaulle had learned was that his personal position was stronger if he remained, at least in theory, above the political and party battle, as he had tried to do during the wartime and early postwar years. Before the elections of 1958, he had therefore forbidden his supporters to use his name, “even in the form of an adjective,” in the title of any group or candidate. In 1962 he offered the electors the choice between his resignation and acceptance of a constitutional amendment providing for the election of the president by universal suffrage. Under the original constitution, the president was to be chosen by an electoral college of some 80,000 members, mainly mayors and local leaders. The electors favoured the amendment overwhelmingly. During the parliamentary general election in  Charles de Gaulle   November, the Gaullist party won an additional 64 seats, thus obtaining, with the support of some 30 conservative deputies, a majority in the National Assembly. From then on, de Gaulle was in a position to carry out, with public consent, the plans that he regarded as essential in restoring France to the status of a great power. As a statesman, de Gaulle fought his political battles like a military campaign, using all the devices that he had learned to transform France’s postwar international position of weakness into one of strength and to overcome opposition to his plans at home. These devices have been often described by his fellow citizens: “egoism, pride, aloofness, guile,” according to sociologist and historian Raymond Aron; “empiricism, intuition, flexibility of mind if not of soul,” according to one of the most perceptive of his biographers, Jean Lacouture. From 1962 until his reelection as president in 1965, de Gaulle used the European Economic Community (EEC; now part of the European Union) to serve French interests, especially agricultural interests. France’s participation in the supranational North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) was progressively withdrawn, because de Gaulle’s policy for France was one of “national independence” and of international cooperation based only on agreements between nation-states. This was the main theme of his presidential campaign in 1965. On December 21 he was reelected, though only on the second ballot, after facing a surprisingly strong challenge from the Socialist Franƈois Mitterrand. On March 7, 1966, de Gaulle announced France’s withdrawal from the integrated military command of NATO but not from the alliance. During the remainder of his second term as president, de Gaulle turned his attention increasingly to wider fields. He had already begun a policy of “détente and cooperation” with countries behind the Iron Curtain by encouraging trade and cultural relations with the Soviet Union and the countries of eastern Europe and by recognizing the People’s Republic of China in January 1964. As a solution for the Vietnam War, he advocated a policy of neutrality for all nations concerned, based on a negotiated peace of which a necessary preliminary was to be the withdrawal of all U.S. troops from Vietnam. These activities, together with visits to Canada, the Far East, and all of Latin America, formed part of a policy that aimed at increasing the influence of France, first in French-speaking countries or countries that shared some bond derived from a common attachment to Latin culture, then in Europe, which, in his view, would sooner or later extend beyond the boundaries of the EEC or the division into Western and Eastern blocs, and finally in the world, where he foresaw the gradual dissolution of the two great blocs. Charles de Gaulle   Circumstances worked against his success. He felt obliged to take up attitudes that were generally interpreted as anti-American. His theory of “desatellization,” the progressive loosening of the Soviet hold on the countries of eastern Europe, was brutally invalidated by the Soviet invasion of Czechoslovakia in 1968. Moreover, there was no evidence that France carried any real weight with the countries that it hoped to influence.

[now Darjiling]), politician and leader of the Swaraj
(Independence) Party in Bengal under British rule.
After failing the competitive entrance examination for

Bitterly opposing British rule in India and rejecting all ideas of political or economic

movement launched against British rule by Mahatma Gandhi and in 1921 was imprisoned
for six months as a political offender. In 1922 he became president of the Indian National
Congress. Under his leadership the Congress abandoned its intentions to boycott colonially
sponsored elections for provincial councils. It decided instead to participate in order to seek
positions that would permit them to obstruct governmental business from within.
Later, when the Swarajists were returned as the largest party in Bengal, Das declined the
post of chief minister, stating that his aim was to wreck the existing government, not to
cooperate with it. In 1924 he was elected mayor of Calcutta (now Kolkata) and tried to
improve the lot of the city’s neglected Indian population. In 1925 there were some signs of
a possible compromise between Das and Lord Birkenhead, the secretary of state for India,

Christian Lundeberg, (born July 14, 1842, Valbo, Swed.—died Nov. 10, 1911,
Stockholm), industrialist and politician who presided over the 1905 Swedish government,
which negotiated an end to the Swedish-Norwegian union.
A leading ironmaster, Lundeberg was active in industrial organizations and local
government before entering the upper chamber of the Riksdag (parliament) in 1885. He
served as deputy speaker of that body from 1899 to 1908 and as speaker from 1908 to
1911. After 1888 he was undisputed leader of the conservative groups in parliament. In
parliament and in the council of state (as chairman from 1896 to 1900 and from 1902 to
1904) he vigorously fought for a strong defense position and for maintenance of the
Swedish-Norwegian union.
When separation of the two states became inevitable in 1905, King Oscar II appointed
Lundeberg prime minister of a coalition government to negotiate a separation that would be
satisfactory to Sweden. Lundeberg, amidst an atmosphere of crisis in both countries,
succeeded in drawing up terms of separation acceptable to everyone involved. With the
dissolution of the union, the Lundeberg government resigned in October 1905.

Christian Magnus Falsen
Christian Magnus Falsen, (born September 14,
1782, Christiania [now Oslo], Norway—died January
13, 1830, Christiania), nationalist political leader,
generally regarded as the author of the Norwegian
constitution.
Falsen was among those who assembled at the
Norwegian village of Eidsvold (now Eidsvoll) on April 10, 1814, to attempt to undo the
results of the Treaty of Kiel (January 14, 1814), by which Denmark ceded Norway to
Sweden. They met to frame a declaration of independence and a constitution and to
determine what action to take against Sweden. Falsen led a majority Independent Party that
wanted complete independence and was prepared to resist Sweden militarily. There was
also a small Union Party that wanted a personal union with Sweden—a dual monarchy.
With an associate, Falsen had drafted a quite liberal constitution before the assembly met.
That document served as a guide for the constitution committee, of which he was chairman.
Although the more radical clauses were deleted in the final draft (the present Norwegian
constitution), he became known as the “father of the constitution.” In the summer of 1814
his party put up a futile military resistance to the Swedes. The Swedes, however, rather
than insist on annexation, accepted a personal union with Norway (1814–1905) and also
agreed to the maintenance of the Norwegian constitution with modifications. Falsen took a
seat in the Storting (parliament) and began to favour a more conservative political position.
After the Storting in 1824 rejected an amendment by him that would have greatly restricted
the franchise, his career ended in a wave of vilification.

Christian Michelsen, (born March 15, 1857, Bergen, Norway—died June 28, 1925,
Fjøsanger, near Bergen), Norwegian statesman who, as prime minister, proclaimed his
country’s separation from Sweden in 1905.
Michelsen began his career as a lawyer; later he started his own shipping firm, which
became one of the largest in Norway. A member of the Storting (parliament) from 1891, he
adhered at first to the “Pure” Left Party but later broke with it and in 1903 was returned to
the Storting as a member of the Coalition Party (conservatives and moderate liberals). In
February 1905 he abandoned the coalition ministry of G.F. Hagerup in protest against
Hagerup’s extremely moderate policy in the growing conflict with Sweden. On March 11
Michelsen was appointed prime minister in a new coalition; thenceforth he was the
unquestioned leader of the Norwegians in the conflict that led to the dissolution of the
union with Sweden and the establishment of the new Kingdom of Norway under King
Haakon VII. Michelsen remained in office until Oct. 28, 1907, when he retired because of
illness. In 1909 he helped organize the moderately conservative Liberal Left Party,
although he refused to be its leader; after 1910 he retired from political life.

Christian VIII
Christian VIII, in full Christian Frederik, (born Sept.
18, 1786, Copenhagen—died Jan. 20, 1848,
Amalienborg, Den.), king of Denmark during the rise of
the liberal opposition to absolutism in the first half of
the 19th century.
While still crown prince of Denmark and recent
stadtholder (governor) of Norway, Christian accepted election as king of Norway in 1814
by the Norwegian independence faction, which refused to recognize the cession of Norway
to Sweden. After leading a futile resistance against the Swedes, however, Christian was
forced to abdicate. Christian’s liberal sympathies emerged clearly in this episode, and,
when he returned to Denmark, he was looked upon with suspicion by conservative state
officials. He therefore remained out of public affairs until 1831, when he joined the council
of state.
Coming to the throne at the death of his father, Frederick VI, in 1839, Christian VIII gave
up his earlier liberalism and firmly resisted the demands of the advocates of a constitutional
regime. He did, however, reform the prison system and restore the Icelandic Althing
(parliament) in 1843. Christian VIII died in 1848, as liberal and nationalistic agitation in
Denmark rose to fever heat.

Chu Van Tan
Chu Van Tan, (born c. 1909, Phu Thuong village, Vietnam—died 1984), military and
political leader who played an important part in winning Vietnam’s independence from
France.
Chu Van Tan became chieftain of the Tho, a tribal ethnic minority in the mountainous
regions of northern Vietnam near the China border. Before World War II, Chu Van Tan
organized his people into a revolutionary militia to resist the French. By 1940–41 he had
formed an effective fighting force, the Vietnam National Salvation Army, and won a
victory over French-directed troops in the Red River Delta. Joining forces with the Vietnam
League for Independence (Viet Minh) under Ho Chi Minh, Chu integrated his tribal
platoons with those of General Vo Nguyen Giap in 1941 and formed the Revolutionary
Military Committee of North Vietnam. After a successful uprising in August 1945, Ho Chi
Minh declared an independent Democratic Republic of Vietnam (DRV) on September 2,
1945, and Chu Van Tan was named minister of defense. During the war against France
(1946–54), Chu’s army formed the nucleus of the People’s Army, which in 1954 defeated
the French decisively at Dien Bien Phu.
In 1947 Chu Van Tan was named president of the Military Committee of Viet Bac region
and given charge of ethnic minority affairs. He eventually became responsible for
preserving tribal autonomy and protecting tribal interests within the framework of the
North Vietnamese government. In the mid-1970s he was made secretary-general of the
Standing Committee of the National Assembly. However, in 1979 he was reportedly
arrested, having been accused of being pro-Chinese. According to various sources, he died
in prison in 1984.

Ch’oe Che-u
Ch’oe Che-u, (born 1824, North Kyŏngsang province, Korea [now in South Korea]—died
1864, Seoul), founder of the Tonghak sect, a religion amalgamated of Buddhist, Taoist,
Confucian, and even some Roman Catholic elements with an apocalyptic flavour and a
hostility to Western culture, which was then beginning to undermine the traditional Korean
order. The sect, later known as the Ch’ŏndogyo (“Religion of the Heavenly Way”), was
important in the modernization of Korea by advocating the strengthening of the country to
combat foreign influences.
The son of a poor village scholar, Ch’oe repeatedly failed the civil-service examinations
that he had to pass to qualify for high office. Then in May 1860, following news of China’s
defeat by a combined British-French force in the “Arrow” War and the success of the great
Christian-inspired Taiping Rebellion in South China, Ch’oe claimed he had received a
mandate to create a religion that would make Korea as strong as the West. Calling his
doctrine Tonghak (“Eastern Learning”), he taught that it was the duty of all men to “serve
heaven.” If everyone believed, said Ch’oe, all would live in harmony with the “one
heaven”; moreover, everyone would be equal before it.
Ch’oe’s new doctrine immediately gained a tremendous following, especially among the
downtrodden, underprivileged peasants of southern Korea. Many were inspired to rise up
against the government. That rebellion led to Ch’oe’s arrest and execution, along with 20 of
his followers. Tonghak survived, however, and spread into every province in Korea,
causing numerous peasant rebellions. Ch’oe’s emphasis on the need to strengthen the
Korean nation to combat foreign influence provided later reformers with a strong
rationalization for political and economic reforms.

leader of the Korean apocalyptic antiforeign Tonghak (Ch’ŏndogyo) religion, who helped
organize the underground network that spread the sect after the 1864 execution of its
founder, Ch’oe Che-u, for fomenting rebellion.
After Ch’oe Che-u’s death, Ch’oe Si-hyŏng took over the important task of realigning the
sect’s ranks through a series of underground networks. In 1880 and 1881, he published the
first two Tonghak scriptures, thus giving the religion an intellectual basis. In these
scriptures he expanded his predecessor’s idea that all men are not only equal before heaven
but that they also must serve heaven. Moreover, he translated these principles into social
action by teaching that people ought to “serve Man as they serve heaven.” Meanwhile, he
continued to preach the necessity of Korea’s becoming as strong as the Western imperialist
powers. In 1892 he mobilized tens of thousands of his followers to stage a peaceful
demonstration under the banner of “Expel the West, Expel the Japanese, and Inculcate
Righteousness,” claiming the innocence of the Tonghak founder and calling for
administrative reform. In 1894 he led the so-called Tonghak Revolt against the “corrupt
government.” The uprising was viciously suppressed, and in 1898 Ch’oe Si-hyŏng was
finally arrested and executed, but not before Tonghak had spread throughout Korea.

Clement Attlee
Clement Attlee, in full Clement Richard Attlee, 1st
Earl Attlee of Walthamstow, Viscount Prestwood,
(born January 3, 1883, Putney, London, England—
died October 8, 1967, Westminster, London), British
Labour Party leader (1935–55) and prime minister
(1945–51). He presided over the establishment of the
welfare state in Great Britain and the granting of
independence to India, the most important step in the conversion of the British Empire into
the Commonwealth of Nations. He was perhaps the leading Labour politician of the 20th
century. He transformed his party into the natural opponent of the Conservative Party and
thus polarized British politics.
Early life
Clement Attlee was the fourth son of Henry Attlee, a prosperous London solicitor, and
Ellen Watson. He was educated at Haileybury College, a boarding school in Hertfordshire
with a strong imperial tradition, and the University of Oxford. He was called to the bar in
1905 but abandoned law in 1909.
In 1905 he began regular visits to the impoverished East End of London, where he did
volunteer work at a settlement house that was supported by Haileybury College. Two years
later he took up residence at the house—a move that decisively influenced his whole
political future. The harsh poverty he saw in East London undermined his faith in the
existing order. Although he did not undergo a sudden political conversion, his views moved
steadily to the left, and he became and remained throughout his life a committed ethical
socialist. He joined the Fabian Society in 1907 and the Independent Labour Party in 1908.
For the next 15 years, apart from his World War I service (he served in Gallipoli, Iraq, and
France), he continued to live in the heart of London’s slums.
In everything except politics, Attlee was profoundly conservative. He liked and respected
almost every traditional institution with which he was associated. He was also strongly
family oriented, and—unusual among bourgeois socialists of his epoch—he felt no
revulsion against his class and background. Moreover, there was almost as little vanity in
him as there was iconoclasm. Apart from his well-developed social conscience, he was in

every respect a conventional and rather self-effacing English upper-middle-class
gentleman.
Political beginnings
Entering East End politics after the war, Attlee became mayor of the borough of Stepney in
1919 and was elected to Parliament from the constituency of Limehouse in 1922. This
parliamentary provenance was crucial to his emergence in 1935 as Labour Party leader and
as the first Labour prime minister to command a governing majority.
In the House of Commons his progress was steady but not meteoric. He served as
undersecretary of state for war in the first Labour government (1924), led by Ramsay
MacDonald. In 1927 he was appointed to the Indian Statutory Commission. Joining the
Labour government in 1930, he was successively chancellor of the duchy of Lancaster—a
sinecure that left him free to give wide-ranging assistance to the prime minister and other
senior ministers—and postmaster general.
Following the formation of MacDonald’s “National” coalition government with the
Conservative Party and the Liberal Party in 1931, the Labour Party suffered an electoral
massacre. Only the 52 most rock-solid working-class constituencies returned Labour
members, Limehouse among them. After the election, Attlee repudiated MacDonald and
refused, like most Labour ministers, to serve in MacDonald’s 1931–35 administration.
After the general election of 1931, Attlee became deputy party leader under George
Lansbury. After Lansbury was forced to resign in 1935 because of his strong pacifism,
Attlee succeeded to the leadership. A by-election and the subsequent general election
returned several figures to the House of Commons—including Arthur Greenwood and
Herbert Morrison—who probably would have been preferred to Attlee had they been
members of the previous Parliament. They did not, however, succeed in replacing him as
leader.
Under Attlee’s leadership in the late 1930s, the party adopted a moderate domestic policy
and supported resistance to fascism and aggression abroad, though it was reluctant to
accept rearmament. Attlee gave his full support to the British declaration of war against
Germany in 1939, but he was unwilling to join a coalition government under Conservative
Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain. In May 1940 it became impossible for Chamberlain
to carry on without Labour support, and Attlee’s refusal to provide it was decisive in
forcing Chamberlain’s replacement by Winston Churchill. Attlee then entered the war
cabinet as lord privy seal; by 1942 he had become deputy prime minister and secretary of

state for Dominion affairs. In 1943 he became lord president of the council—though he
retained the deputy prime ministership—and he served in this capacity until the end of the
war. Only he and Churchill served continuously in the war cabinet throughout the life of
the coalition government.
In May 1945 Attlee led his party out of the coalition and achieved a stunning parliamentary
majority in the subsequent general election, capturing 393 seats in the House of Commons.
He became prime minister in July and held the office until October 1951—longer than any
other prime minister since Herbert Asquith (1908–16).
Prime ministership and later years
Attlee’s government was one of the most significant
20th-century peacetime administrations, both because
of the quality of its leading ministers and because of
the imprint that it left on British politics. Although
several of his principal colleagues—notably
Morrison, Ernest Bevin, Stafford Cripps, Aneurin
Bevan, and Hugh Gaitskell—were more dominant
public personalities than Attlee, until nearly the end of his government he held this
somewhat turbulent team together with great success. His firm control over discussions in
cabinet meetings reflected his experience in the wartime coalition government. It was said
that when Churchill presided over such meetings, they were exhilarating but inconclusive,
whereas when Attlee presided (which was often, since Churchill was frequently absent),
crisp, clear decisions were quickly made.
Although Attlee’s government constantly struggled with a weak balance-of-payments
position, which made American loans and Marshall Plan assistance essential in 1945 and
1948, respectively, he continued with a firm program of nationalization, including coal,
railways, gas, and electricity. One of the highlights of his administration was its social
reforms, including the creation of the National Health Service. Together, these programs
shifted the agenda of British politics in a moderate-left direction for a generation. Three
successive Conservative governments accepted a broad consensus in favour of a mixed
economy, extensive government-funded social services, and the pursuit of full
employment; these priorities were not significantly changed until the election of Margaret
Thatcher in 1979.

Attlee, Clement
Although occasionally expressing doubt about the extent of British military commitments
overseas, Attlee firmly supported the view of his foreign secretary, Bevin, that facing the
Soviet threat required building up the military strength of the West and maintaining the
commitment of the United States to the defense of western Europe. Attlee’s government
was a key architect of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) of 1949. In 1950 he
readily accepted the need for Allied entry in the Korean War and for a new rearmament
program. Additionally, Attlee oversaw the beginning of the dismantling of the British
Empire, granting independence to India in 1947.
In the general election of February 1950, Attlee’s parliamentary majority was reduced to
six, and his government was further weakened in April 1951 by the resignations of Bevan
and Harold Wilson over the introduction of health-service charges. In the autumn of 1951
Attlee decided to ask for a dissolution of Parliament, which resulted in a narrow
Conservative victory and Attlee’s resignation from the prime ministership. He remained
leader of the opposition until December 1955, endeavouring to preserve the unity of his
party throughout the difficult days of the “Bevanite” quarrel. The feud was more personal
than ideological, for the policy differences between the leaders of the two factions—
Gaitskell and Bevan—were surprisingly narrow, much more so than those between Tony
Benn and Denis Healey in the 1980s. But their temperaments were very different, and
Bevan felt that he had been unfairly passed over for the positions of chancellor and foreign
secretary in 1950–51. This may indeed have been Attlee’s major failure in political
management.
After Labour’s defeat in the 1955 election, Attlee
resigned as party leader and was subsequently created
an earl and elevated to the House of Lords, where he
remained politically active until his death in 1967. He
was made a member of the Order of Merit in 1951
and a Knight of the Garter in 1956. Attlee was one of
only four British prime ministers—Arthur James
Balfour, Churchill, and Thatcher were the others—to receive both of these high honours.
His memoirs, As It Happened (1954), are distinguished more for their laconic discretion
than their revelatory interest.

Cuong De
Cuong De, (born 1882—died April 6, 1951, Tokyo, Japan), Vietnamese prince who was
cultivated by Vietnamese nationalists at the turn of the 20th century to serve as a symbol of
a free Vietnam.
As a direct descendant of the emperor Gia Long, Cuong De had a legitimate claim to the
throne of Vietnam but was excluded by the French, who held a protectorate over the
country. By 1904 Cuong De was associating with leaders of the Vietnamese opposition to
French rule, including Phan Boi Chau. He was enrolled with other Vietnamese at Shimbu
Military Academy in Tokyo, where he strengthened his relationship with Phan Boi Chau,
who formed a movement to fight French rule in Vietnam. The strength of the movement
increased, with Cuong De representing a link between royalty and commoner. Japan’s
desire for French financial assistance, together with Japanese imperial intentions, resulted
in Cuong De’s expulsion from Japan at French insistence in 1909. He spent the next few
years traveling in Asian and European countries, vainly seeking support for his cause.
In 1915, during World War I, he returned to Japan, where he received a stipend for his
support and assurance that, if France were defeated in Europe, the Japanese would
guarantee Vietnam’s autonomy. He remained active in the nationalist movement after the
war, sending cables to the Versailles Peace Conference, to the French government, and to
U.S. President Woodrow Wilson, repeating his demands for a free Vietnam. Meanwhile, the
Japanese agreed to withdraw from the issue of Vietnamese independence in exchange for
French assistance in controlling the rebellious Japanese colony of Korea.
Cuong De was honoured by Vietnamese nationalist politicians, but he remained in Japan
and was kept under surveillance. In March 1945, when the Japanese finally removed all
power from the French colonial regime in Indochina, it was thought that Cuong De might
be appointed as a puppet emperor. The Japanese, however, retained the existing emperor,
Bao Dai, on the throne, and Cuong De died in exile.

Dadabhai Naoroji
Dadabhai Naoroji, (born Sept. 4, 1825, Bombay
[now Mumbai], India—died June 30, 1917, Bombay),
Indian nationalist and critic of British economic
policy in India.
Educated at Elphinstone College, Bombay (now
Mumbai), he was professor of mathematics and natural philosophy there before turning to
politics and a career in commerce that took him to England, where he spent much of his
life.
He stood unsuccessfully for election to Parliament in 1886. In 1892, however, he was
elected Liberal member of Parliament for Central Finsbury, London. He became widely
known for his unfavourable opinion of the economic consequences of British rule in India
and was appointed a member of the royal commission on Indian expenditure in 1895. In
1886, 1893, and 1906 he also presided over the annual sessions of the Indian National
Congress, which led the nationalist movement in India. In the session of 1906 his
conciliatory tactics helped to postpone the impending split between moderates and
extremists in the Congress Party. In his many writings and speeches and especially in
Poverty and Un-British Rule in India (1901), Naoroji argued that India was too highly
taxed and that its wealth was being drained away to England.

Daniel Mannix
Daniel Mannix, (born March 4, 1864, Charleville,
County Cork, Ire.—died Nov. 6, 1963, Melbourne),
Roman Catholic prelate who became one of
Australia’s most controversial political figures during
the first half of the 20th century.
Mannix studied at St. Patrick’s College, Maynooth,
County Kildare, where he was ordained priest in 1890 and where he taught philosophy
(1891) and theology (1894); from 1903 to 1912 he served as president of the college.
Consecrated titular archbishop of Pharsalus in 1912, he arrived in Melbourne in the
following year as coadjutor archbishop, becoming archbishop of Melbourne in 1917.
Mannix’s forthright demands for state aid for the education of Roman Catholics in return
for their taxes and his opposition to drafting soldiers for World War I made him the subject
of controversy. A zealous supporter of Irish independence, he made an official journey to
Rome in 1920 via the United States, where his lengthy speechmaking attracted enthusiastic
crowds. His campaign in behalf of the Irish, however, caused the British government to
prevent him from landing in Ireland, which he finally visited in 1925.
After World War II Mannix sought to stop Communist infiltration of the Australian trade
unions; he played a controversial part in the dissensions within the Australian Labor Party
and backed the largely right-wing Catholic Democratic Labor Party, which broke away. A
promoter of Catholic Action (i.e., lay apostolic activity in the temporal society) and of the
Catholic social movement, he is responsible for having established 181 schools, including
Newman College and St. Mary’s College at the University of Melbourne, and 108 parishes.

Daniel O'Connell
Daniel O’Connell
Daniel O’Connell, byname The Liberator, (born
Aug. 6, 1775, near Cahirciveen, County Kerry, Ire.—
died May 15, 1847, Genoa, Kingdom of Sardinia
[Italy]), lawyer who became the first great 19th-
century Irish nationalist leader.
Compelled to leave the Roman Catholic college at
Douai, France, when the French Revolution broke out, O’Connell went to London to study
law, and in 1798 he was called to the Irish bar. His forensic skill enabled him to use the
courts as nationalist forums. Although he had joined the Society of United Irishmen, a
revolutionary society, as early as 1797, he refused to participate in the Irish Rebellion of
the following year. When the Act of Union (which took effect Jan. 1, 1801) abolished the
Irish Parliament, he insisted that the British Parliament repeal the anti-Catholic laws in
order to justify its claim to represent the people of Ireland. From 1813 he opposed various
Catholic relief proposals because the government, with the acquiescence of the papacy,
would have had the right to veto nominations to Catholic bishoprics in Great Britain and
Ireland. Although permanent political organizations of Catholics were illegal, O’Connell
set up a nationwide series of mass meetings to petition for Catholic emancipation.
On May 12, 1823, O’Connell and Richard Lalor Sheil
(1791–1851) founded the Catholic Association, which
quickly attracted the support of the Irish priesthood
and of lawyers and other educated Catholic laymen
and which eventually comprised so many members
that the government could not suppress it. In 1826,
when it was reorganized as the New Catholic Association, it caused the defeat of several
parliamentary candidates sponsored by large landowners. In County Clare in July 1828,
O’Connell himself, although (as a Catholic) ineligible to sit in the House of Commons,
defeated a man who tried to support both the British government and Catholic
emancipation. This result impressed on the British prime minister, Arthur Wellesley, 1st
duke of Wellington, the need for making a major concession to the Irish Catholics.
Following the passage of the Catholic Emancipation Act of 1829, O’Connell, after going
through the formality of an uncontested reelection, took his seat at Westminster.

In April 1835 he helped to overthrow Sir Robert
Peel’s Conservative ministry, and in the same year he
entered into the “Lichfield House compact,” whereby
he promised the Whig Party leaders a period of
“perfect calm” in Ireland while the government
enacted reform measures. O’Connell and his Irish
adherents (known collectively as “O’Connell’s tail”) then aided in keeping the weak Whig
administration of William Lamb, 2nd Viscount Melbourne, in office from 1835 to 1841. By
1839, however, O’Connell realized that the Whigs would do little more than the
Conservatives for Ireland, and in 1840 he founded the Repeal Association to dissolve the
Anglo-Irish legislative union. A series of mass meetings in all parts of Ireland culminated
in O’Connell’s arrest for seditious conspiracy, but he was released on appeal after three
months’ imprisonment (June–September 1844). Afterward his health failed rapidly, and the
nationalist leadership fell to the radical Young Ireland group.

Daniele Manin
Daniele Manin, (born May 13, 1804, Venice [Italy]
—died Sept. 22, 1857, Paris, Fr.), leader of the
Risorgimento in Venice.
The son of a converted Jewish lawyer (who had taken
his sponsors’ historic name at baptism), Manin
studied law at Padua, graduating at age 17. Early in his practice, he showed little interest in
politics and disapproved of the conspiratorial activities of the Carbonari and other
revolutionary groups. But in the late 1840s, Manin underwent a change and joined the
patriot Niccolò Tommaseo in giving expression to the discontent of the Venetian people
under Austrian rule.
When Manin presented a petition for home rule to the Congregation, the quasi-
representative body of the Austrian province of Venetia, he was imprisoned along with
Tommaseo (January 1848). After the rebellions of the following March, however, he was
freed and made president of the Venetian republic, in which capacity he reluctantly
accepted the project of union with the kingdom of Piedmont-Sardinia in the name of Italian
unification. He led a heroic defense of Venice against an Austrian siege even after the
defeat of the Piedmontese army at Novara; when cholera and bombardment finally forced
surrender in August 1849, Manin was among those excepted from amnesty and was
banished. For the remainder of his life he lived in Paris, where he strove to enlist French
sympathy for the Italian cause. In 1868, 11 years after his death, his body was returned to
liberated Venice for a state funeral.

Dato’ Onn bin Jaafar
Dato’ Onn bin Jaafar, (born 1895, Johor Bahru, Malaya [now in Malaysia]—died January
19, 1962, Johor Bahru), Malayan political figure who played a leading role in the Merdeka
(independence) movement and the establishment of the Federation of Malaya, forerunner
of the present country of Malaysia.
Born in the sultanate of Johore (later the state of Johor), north of Singapore, Onn was
educated in England and served for a time as a government officer in Johore. Turning then
to journalism, he edited two Malay newspapers, the Lembaga Malayu (“Malaya Tribune”)
and the Warta Malaya (“Malayan Report”), the first independent Malay daily. After World
War II he became extremely active in Malayan politics. By 1946 the British had secured
signatures from all the peninsular Malay sultans agreeing to a Malayan Union—one that
would transfer political power from the sultans to a central government in Kuala Lumpur
and that would grant all people in Malaya, regardless of race or religion, equal rights as
citizens. Opposing both the British and the sultans, Onn led the protest against this union,
holding that giving the economically dominant Chinese and Indians a part in the
government would lead to the “extinction” of the Malay race. Convening a meeting of
more than 40 Malay organizations in March 1946 to oppose the union, Onn founded the
United Malays National Organization (UMNO), a political party representing purely Malay
interests. When the plan for a union was eventually withdrawn, the sultan of Johore
appointed him prime minister (Mentri Besar) of his state, and in February 1948 he became
Member for Home Affairs for the Federation of Malaya.
Although known as an advocate of specifically Malay interests, Onn in 1951 resigned from
UMNO because it rejected his proposal that membership be open to persons of all races.
He was replaced by Tunku Abdul Rahman, later prime minister of Malaysia. Onn formed
two political parties on his own, the Independence of Malaya Party and the Party Negara
(National Party) in 1953–55; but, when neither party gained popular support against
Rahman’s new Alliance Party, he was eclipsed from Malayan political life.

David Ben-Gurion
David Ben-Gurion
David Ben-Gurion, original name David Gruen,
(born October 16, 1886, Płońsk, Poland, Russian
Empire [now in Poland]—died December 1, 1973, Tel
Aviv–Yafo, Israel), Zionist statesman and political
leader, the first prime minister (1948–53, 1955–63)
and defense minister (1948–53; 1955–63) of Israel. It
was Ben-Gurion who, on May 14, 1948, at Tel Aviv,
delivered Israel’s declaration of independence. His charismatic personality won him the
adoration of the masses, and, after his retirement from the government and, later, from the
Knesset (the Israeli house of representatives), he was revered as the “Father of the Nation.”
(Read Ben-Gurion’s Britannica essay on Theodor Herzl.)
Ben-Gurion, born David Gruen, was the son of Victor Gruen, one of the leaders in Płońsk
of the “Lovers of Zion,” a movement that was disseminating among the oppressed Jews of
eastern Europe the idea of the return to their original homeland of Israel. Zionism
fascinated the young David Gruen, and he became convinced that the first step for the Jews
who wanted to revive Israel as a nation was to immigrate to Palestine and settle there as
farmers. In 1906 the 20-year-old Gruen arrived in Palestine and for several years worked as
a farmer in the Jewish agricultural settlements in the coastal plain and in Galilee, the
northern region of Palestine. There he adopted the ancient Hebrew name Ben-Gurion.
Suffering the hardships of the early pioneers, including malaria and hunger, he never lost
sight of his goal. It was owing to his efforts that the 1907 convention of his Zionist socialist
party, Poale Zion (“Workers of Zion”), included the following declaration in its platform:
“The party aspires to the political independence of the Jewish people in this land.”
With the outbreak of World War I, the Turkish governors of Palestine, their suspicions
aroused by his Zionist activity, arrested Ben-Gurion and expelled him from the Ottoman
Empire. During the height of the war, he traveled to New York, where he met and
eventually married the Russian-born Pauline Munweis. In the last stages of World War I,
the British supplanted Turkish rule in the Middle East; and with this change the Jewish
settlers and their friends and supporters abroad began to realize that Zionism could rely for
future assistance on Britain as well as on the wealthy and influential segments of American
Jewry. Following the British government’s publication on November 2, 1917, of the
Balfour Declaration, which promised the Jews a “national home” in Palestine, Ben-Gurion

enlisted in the British army’s Jewish Legion and sailed back to the Middle East to join the
war for the liberation of Palestine from Ottoman rule.
The British had already defeated the Turks when the Jewish Legion reached the battlefield,
and, when Britain received the mandate over Palestine, the work of realizing the “Jewish
national home” had begun. For Ben-Gurion, the “national home” was a step toward
political independence. To implement it, he called for accelerated Jewish immigration to
Palestine in the effort to create a Jewish nucleus that would serve as the foundation for the
establishment of a Jewish state. That nucleus was the Histadrut—the confederation of
Jewish workers in Palestine founded in 1920 by Ben-Gurion (who was elected its first
secretary-general) and his colleagues. The Histadrut rapidly became a central force in
social, economic, and even security affairs, attaining the position of a “state within a state.”
Ten years later, in 1930, a number of labour factions united and founded Mapai, the Israeli
Workers Party, with Ben-Gurion at its head. In 1935 he was elected chairman of the Zionist
Executive, the highest directing body of world Zionism, and head of the Jewish Agency,
the movement’s executive branch.
As the Jewish settlement strengthened and deepened its roots in Palestine, anxiety mounted
among the Palestinian Arabs, resulting in violent clashes between the two communities. In
1939 Britain changed its Middle East policy, abandoning its sympathetic stand toward the
Jews and adopting a sympathetic attitude toward the Arabs, leading to severe restrictions on
Jewish immigration and settlement in Palestine. Ben-Gurion reacted by calling upon the
Jewish community to rise against England, thus heralding the decade of “fighting
Zionism.” On May 12, 1942, he assembled an emergency conference of American Zionists
in New York City; the convention decided upon the establishment of a Jewish
commonwealth in Palestine after the war. At the end of World War II, Ben-Gurion again led
the Jewish community in its successful struggle against the British mandate; and in May
1948, in accordance with a decision of the United Nations General Assembly, with the
support of the United States and the Soviet Union, the State of Israel was established.
David Ben-Gurion became prime minister and minister of defense. Through internal
political struggles that incensed both the right and the left, he succeeded in breaking up the
underground armies that had fought the British and in fusing them into a national army,
which became a model and symbol of the maturing Israeli nation and an effective force
against the invading Arab armies from Syria, Jordan, Iraq, and Egypt. Although the fighting
ended with an Israeli victory, the Arab leaders refused to enter into formal peace
negotiations with the Jewish state.

David Ben-Gurion and Golda
Meir
Ben-Gurion viewed the newborn state as the direct continuation of Jewish history that, in
his opinion, had been interrupted 2,000 years earlier when the Roman legions had crushed
the Hebrew freedom fighters and banished the Jews from Palestine. He saw the Jews’
period of exile as a prolonged interlude in the history of Israel and declared that they had
now regained their rightful home. In order to strengthen and develop the young nation,
Ben-Gurion presented the people of Israel with a series of challenges: the absorption of
mass immigration from all over the world; the assimilation of newcomers of diverse
communities and backgrounds; the creation of a unified public education system; the
settlement of the desert lands. In his foreign policy, he adopted an independent and
pragmatic course. He used to say: “What matters is not what the Gentiles will say, but what
the Jews will do.” His defense policy was firm, and he answered violations of the cease-fire
agreements by neighbouring Arab states with military reprisals.
His stronghanded policy inspired little sympathy for
him from the governments of the United States and
Britain. They preferred more moderate leaders such
as Chaim Weizmann, first president of Israel, and
Moshe Sharett, who was elected prime minister for a
brief term (1953–55) when Ben-Gurion temporarily
retired from office. Striving to gain a foothold in the
Middle East, the U.S.S.R. alienated Israel by
providing the Arabs with vast quantities of arms. At that time, Ben-Gurion found an ally in
France. During the war in Algeria, France encountered the opposition of the united Arab
front, led by Egyptian Pres. Gamal Abdel Nasser, and consequently drew closer to Israel,
supplying it with considerable amounts of military equipment; when Nasser nationalized
the Suez Canal in July 1956, French initiative brought Israel to join the Franco-British
military campaign against Egypt. On October 29, 1956, following a secret visit to France
and a meeting with French and British leaders, Ben-Gurion ordered the army to take over
the Sinai Peninsula, while France and Britain were making an abortive attempt to seize the
canal. Israel subsequently withdrew from Sinai after having been assured freedom of
navigation in the Strait of Tiran and de facto peace along the Egyptian-Israeli border, which
was to be supervised by a special United Nations force.
Following the Sinai campaign, Israel entered a period of diplomatic and economic
prosperity. Ben-Gurion was head of government until 1963. During his last years of office,
he initiated several plans (which proved fruitless) for secret talks with Arab leaders with a
view to establishing peace in the Middle East.

David Ben-Gurion and Shimon
Peres
In June 1963 Ben-Gurion unexpectedly resigned from
the government for unnamed “personal reasons.” His
move apparently resulted in part from the bitter
internal controversy between his supporters and his
rivals in the party, who rose against him for the first
time because of the political implications of the 1954
“Lavon Affair,” involving Israeli-inspired sabotage of
U.S. and British property in Egypt. The affair led
Ben-Gurion in 1965 to leave Mapai with a number of his supporters and to found a small
opposition party, Rafi, at the head of which he fought, with little success, against his
successor, Levi Eshkol.
In 1970 Ben-Gurion retired from the Knesset and from all political activity, devoting
himself to the writing of his memoirs in Sde-Boqer, a kibbutz in the Negev. He published a
number of books, mostly collections of speeches and essays. Through most of his life he
had also engaged in researches into the history of the Jewish community in Palestine and in
the study of the Bible.

In 1970 Ben-Gurion retired from the Knesset and from all political activity, devoting himself to the writing of his memoirs in Sde-Boqer, a kibbutz in the Negev. He published a number of books, mostly collections of speeches and essays. Through most of his life he had also engaged in researches into the history of the Jewish community in Palestine and in the study of the Bible. Michael Bar-Zohar",

David Lloyd George
David Lloyd George
David Lloyd George, also called (1945) 1st Earl Lloyd-
George of Dwyfor, Viscount Gwynedd of Dwyfor, (born
Jan. 17, 1863, Manchester, Eng.—died March 26, 1945, Ty-
newydd, near Llanystumdwy, Caernarvonshire, Wales),
British prime minister (1916–22) who dominated the British
political scene in the latter part of World War I. He was raised
to the peerage in the year of his death.
Early life
Lloyd George’s father was a Welshman from Pembrokeshire and had become headmaster
of an elementary school in Manchester. His mother was the daughter of David Lloyd, a
Baptist minister. His father died in June 1864, leaving Mrs. George in poverty. She moved
to Llanystumdwy in Caernarvonshire, where her brother Richard, a shoemaker and Baptist
minister, supported her and her children; and it was from him that David Lloyd George
imbibed many of his formative beliefs. His uncle enabled him to embark at the age of 14 on
the career of a solicitor; he became articled (1879) to a firm at Portmadoc, passing his final
examination in 1884. In Wales, as in Ireland, an anglicized and Anglican Tory
“ascendancy” class of landed gentry dominated a Celtic people of different race and
religion. The causes of the Liberal Party, the Welsh nation, and Nonconformity were
inseparable in the atmosphere in which Lloyd George was raised, and he first made his
name by a successful battle in the courts to establish the right of Nonconformists to burial
in the churchyard of their parish. Ironically, he who came to be the standard-bearer of the
oppressed religious sects had lost his faith even as a boy.
As a young man, Lloyd George had the romantic
good looks that ensured success with women. After
numerous love affairs, he was married in 1888 to
Margaret Owen, who bore him two sons and three
daughters. The marriage cannot be described as
happy. Lloyd George was incapable of fidelity, and
his affairs with other women were notorious. His wife stood by him on many occasions,
but in the end his behaviour was too much for even her long-suffering tolerance.

David Lloyd George
Lloyd George entered Parliament in 1890, winning a by-election at Caernarvon Boroughs,
the seat he retained for 55 years. He soon made a name for himself in the House of
Commons by his audacity, charm, wit, and mastery of the art of debate. During the 10 years
of Liberal opposition that followed the election of 1895, he became a leading figure in the
radical wing of the party. He bitterly and courageously opposed the South African War and
in 1901 was nearly lynched in Birmingham, the stronghold of Joseph Chamberlain and
Conservative imperialism. With the arrival of peace, Lloyd George worked up a great
agitation in Wales against tax-aided grants to church schools established by Balfour’s
Education Act (1902).
Arthur J. Balfour resigned in December 1905, and Sir Henry Campbell-Bannerman formed
a Liberal administration, appointing Lloyd George to the Cabinet as president of the Board
of Trade. In that office, he was responsible for important legislation: the Merchant
Shipping Act (1906), improving seamen’s living conditions, but also endangering their
lives by raising the Plimsoll line on newly constructed ships; the Patents and Designs Act
(1907), preventing foreign exploitation of British inventions; and the Port of London Act
(1908), setting up the Port of London Authority. He also earned a high reputation by his
patient work in settling strikes. He suffered a cruel bereavement in November 1907, when
his daughter Mair died of appendicitis at the age of 17. Years afterward, the sight of her
portrait could plunge him into tears.
Chancellor of the Exchequer. Campbell-Bannerman’s
health failed in 1908. He was succeeded as prime
minister by the chancellor of the Exchequer, Herbert
Henry Asquith, who appointed Lloyd George to take
his own place. This was a notable promotion and
made him at least a strong competitor for the
premiership after Asquith. By this time, the Liberal
Party’s fortunes were beginning to languish. The House of Lords had blocked much of its
social reform legislation, and the radical wing of the party was concerned that its thunder
might be stolen by the nascent Labour Party unless the deadlock could be broken. At the
same time, the demand for more battleships to match the German naval program threatened
the finances available for social reform. It was to meet these difficulties that Lloyd George
framed the famous “People’s Budget” of 1909, calling for taxes upon unearned increment
on the sale of land and on land values, higher death duties, and a supertax on incomes
above £3,000. Moreover, it seemed for a time that the House of Lords’ veto on progressive
legislation would be bypassed, since the custom of the constitution forbade the upper house
1/15/23, 3:44 PM

https://www.britannica.com/print/article/345191
3/8
from interfering with the budget. In fact, however, the Conservative majority in the House
of Lords, against the advice of some of its wiser members, decided to reject it. The
consequences of this rejection were two general elections, a major constitutional crisis, and
the ultimate passage of the Parliament Act of 1911, which severely curtailed the powers of
the upper house. The principal burden of all this fell upon Asquith, but Lloyd George gave
him vigorous support in a series of notable philippics against the aristocracy and the rich.
The most famous of all was his speech at Limehouse, where he denounced the rapacity of
the landlord class, especially the dukes, in unforgettable language.
In 1913 he faced one of the gravest personal crises in his career. In April 1912, along with
Rufus Isaacs, the attorney general, he had purchased shares in the Marconi Wireless
Telegraph Company of America at a rate well below that available to the general public.
The American Marconi company was legally independent of the British concern, but the
two companies were closely connected, and the latter’s shares had recently boomed as a
result of the government’s decision to accept its proposal to construct a chain of radio
stations throughout the empire. Lloyd George and Isaacs denied, in somewhat ambiguous
language, any transactions in the shares of “the Marconi company,” a denial that
technically referred only to the British company but was generally assumed to cover the
American as well. A select committee of the House of Commons revealed the facts and,
although by a party majority it acquitted the ministers of blame, Lloyd George’s reputation
was damaged.
Social reform and the outbreak of war
Lloyd George’s major achievement during the years immediately before the war was in the
field of social insurance. Inspired by a visit to Germany (1908), where he studied the
Bismarckian scheme of insurance benefits, Lloyd George decided to introduce health and
unemployment insurance on a similar basis in Britain. This he did in the National Insurance
Act of 1911. The measure inspired bitter opposition and was even unpopular with the
working class, who were not convinced by Lloyd George’s slogan “ninepence for
fourpence,” the difference in these two figures being the employer’s and the state’s
contribution. Lloyd George, undeterred, piloted his measure through Parliament with great
skill and determination. He thus laid the foundations of the modern welfare state and, if he
had done nothing else, would deserve fame for that achievement.
Though much of the government’s time during these years was occupied by the Irish
question, Lloyd George played little part in it and, on the whole, left foreign policy to his
colleagues. It was, therefore, something of a surprise when, in July 1911, after careful
1/15/23, 3:44 PM

https://www.britannica.com/print/article/345191
4/8
consultation with Asquith and Sir Edward Grey, he issued a formidable warning to
Germany over the Moroccan crisis. When the question of entry into the war convulsed the
Cabinet in late July and early August 1914, he seemed at first to incline to the isolationist
section. For a brief moment he contemplated retirement. But the tide of events swept him
to the other side. As chancellor, he plunged into the financial problems posed by the war.
Minister of munitions and secretary of state for war
Throughout the remainder of 1914 and the early months of 1915, Lloyd George was a
vigorous advocate of increased munitions production. Here he came into sharp conflict
with Lord Kitchener in the War Office. The resignation of Admiral Fisher in 1915 forced
Asquith to reconstruct the government on a coalition basis and admit the Conservatives. In
the new administration, Lloyd George became minister of munitions. In this capacity, he
made one of the most notable contributions to the victory of the Allies. His methods were
unorthodox and shocked the civil service, but his energy was immense. He imported able
assistants from big business and used his eloquence to induce the cooperation of organized
labour. When, in the summer of 1916, the great Battle of the Somme began, supplies were
forthcoming.
Lloyd George acquired definite views on war strategy at an early stage. He doubted the
possibility of breaking through on the Western Front and advocated instead a flank attack
from the Near East. He was thus at loggerheads with the view of the official military
hierarchy, cogently pressed by Sir Douglas Haig and Sir William Robertson, that the war
could only be won in the West. On June 5, 1916, Kitchener was drowned on his way to
Russia, when his ship struck a German mine. A last-minute accident—acute developments
in the Irish situation—alone had prevented Lloyd George from travelling with him. After
some hesitation, Asquith appointed him to the vacant position at the War Office.
Lloyd George held the post for five months, but Robertson as chief of the imperial general
staff possessed nearly all the important powers of the war minister. Lloyd George chafed
under these restrictions, the more so because he disagreed with Robertson on issues of
strategy. Thus frustrated, he began to survey the whole direction of the war with increasing
skepticism; and he did not conceal his doubts from his friends who, by the end of
November, had become convinced that Asquith should delegate the day-to-day running of
the war to a small committee whose chairman should be Lloyd George. There was
undoubtedly widespread uneasiness at Asquith’s conduct of affairs, particularly in the
Conservative Party. Asquith was manoeuvred into resigning on December 5 and was
1/15/23, 3:44 PM

https://www.britannica.com/print/article/345191
5/8
replaced two days later by Lloyd George. He was supported by the leading Conservatives,
but the most prominent Liberal ministers resigned with Asquith.
Prime minister
Lloyd George was now 54 and at the height of his
powers. His energy, eloquence, and ability had
already made him the leading statesman of the day,
and his accession to the premiership was highly
popular in the country generally. He immediately
substituted a small War Cabinet of five, which was to
be in constant session, for the body of 23 that had hitherto conducted affairs. The result was
a general speeding up of decisions.
One of Lloyd George’s most notable efforts was in combating the submarine menace,
which, in early 1917, threatened to starve Britain into submission. He achieved this by
forcing the adoption of the convoy system upon a reluctant Admiralty. The food shortage
resulting from the submarine war was acute. Drastic action had to be taken to step up
agricultural production, and eventually a system of food rationing had to be introduced
(1918). In these matters Lloyd George was at his best, contemptuous of red tape,
determined to take action and to make his will prevail.
It was in the field of grand strategy that he was least successful. Lloyd George remained
profoundly skeptical of the ability of the British high command to conduct even a
“Western” strategy successfully. Without warning Haig or Robertson in advance, he
confronted them at the Calais Conference of February 1917 with a plan to place the British
army under French command for General Robert-Georges Nivelle’s forthcoming offensive.
Haig and Robertson deeply distrusted Lloyd George from that moment onward. The
Nivelle offensive was a total failure, and Lloyd George was, as a result, on shaky ground
when he endeavoured to resist Haig’s proposals for a major British campaign in Flanders in
the summer. After much hesitation, he gave way, and on July 31, 1917, the ill-fated
Passchendaele offensive began. Although it may have forestalled a possible German attack
on the French, Passchendaele, with enormous loss of life, achieved none of its main
objectives. Lloyd George was now convinced of the incompetence of the British high
command.
He still dared not take action against them openly. Instead, he began what Sir Winston
Churchill called “a series of extremely laborious and mystifying maneuvers,” with the
1/15/23, 3:44 PM

https://www.britannica.com/print/article/345191
6/8
object of creating a unified command under someone other than Haig. In February 1918
Robertson offered his resignation, which Lloyd George accepted, but Haig remained as
commander in chief. Such was Lloyd George’s distrust of Haig that, during the winter of
1917–18, he had deliberately kept him short of troops for fear that he might renew the
attack. The result was that the German commander, General Erich Ludendorff, came near
to launching a successful offensive against the British sector in March 1918. The
emergency caused a unified command under Marshal Ferdinand Foch to be established
(April), and by May the situation had stabilized.
The tide now turned, and the Western Allies launched a series of successful attacks upon
the exhausted Germans. The Armistice of November 1918 presented Lloyd George with a
dilemma. Should he allow a return to peacetime party politics or continue the coalition?
There was little doubt of the answer. The leader of the Conservatives, Bonar Law, was
willing to cooperate. A somewhat perfunctory offer to include Asquith was declined. The
ensuing election in December gave the coalitionists an overwhelming victory. The rift
between Lloyd George and Asquith’s supporters was now wider than ever, however, and
Lloyd George was now largely dependent on Conservative support.
As one of the three great statesmen at Versailles,
Lloyd George must bear a major responsibility for the
peace settlement. He pursued a middle course
between Georges Clemenceau and Woodrow Wilson.
But, throughout, Lloyd George was under pressure to
pursue the more draconian policy of Clemenceau. It is
to his credit that the final settlement was not far worse than it was. The treaty was well
received in Britain, and in August 1919 the king conferred on Lloyd George the Order of
Merit.
A major domestic problem was Ireland, where the Sinn Fein refused to recognize the
British Parliament. From 1919 to 1921 a civil war raged. In the summer of 1921, Lloyd
George, with full agreement of his Conservative colleagues, reversed the policy of
repression in Ireland and began the negotiations that culminated in Irish independence in
December 1921. The more rigid Tories never forgave this “surrender,” as they deemed it. In
1922 Lloyd George ran into trouble over the so-called honours scandal, when accusations
were made that peerages and other honours were being sold for large campaign
contributions. Tory discontent was rife, when, from a wholly unexpected quarter, a crisis
occurred that drove Lloyd George from power forever. This was the Çanak incident, in

which it seemed to critics that the reckless foreign policy of the government had led Britain
to the verge of an unnecessary war with Turkey. When the Conservative leaders decided to
appeal to the country on a coalition basis once again, a party revolt ensued. Bonar Law,
who had retired because of ill health in 1921, returned to the political scene. On Oct. 19,
1922, a two-to-one majority of Conservative members of Parliament endorsed his and
Stanley Baldwin’s plea to fight as an independent party. Lloyd George at once resigned.
Later years and assessment
The long twilight of Lloyd George’s career was a
melancholy anticlimax. The feud with the Asquithians
was never healed, and from 1926 to 1931 he headed
an ailing Liberal Party. He devoted himself thereafter
to writing his War Memoirs (1933–36) and The Truth
About the Peace Treaties (1938). In 1940 Winston
Churchill invited him to join his War Cabinet, but Lloyd George declined, ostensibly on
grounds of age and health. Just two months before his death, he was elevated to the peerage
as Earl Lloyd-George of Dwyfor.
Lloyd George possessed eloquence; extraordinary charm and persuasiveness; a capacity to
see the heart of problems whose complexity baffled lesser men; a profound sympathy with
oppressed classes and races; and a genuine hatred of those who abused power, whether
based on wealth or caste or military might. But there was an obverse side to these virtues:
his love of devious methods; his carelessness over appointments and honours; and a streak
of ruthlessness that left little room for the cultivation of personal friendship.
Lloyd George, for all his greatness, aroused in many persons a profound sense of mistrust,
and it was in the upper-middle class, represented in politics by Stanley Baldwin and Neville
Chamberlain, that he inspired the most acute misgivings. They were both determined to
exclude him from office, and it would be wrong to ascribe his long years in the political
wilderness solely to the declining fortunes of the Liberal Party. Lloyd George was thus
never able to recover the position he had lost in 1922. It was one of the tragedies of the
interwar years that, in an era not notable for political talent, the one man of genius in
politics should have had to remain an impotent spectator. But his earlier achievements
make his place in history secure: he laid the foundations of the welfare state and led Britain
to victory in World War I.

Robert Norman William Blake, Baron Blake  David Lloyd George']","David Lloyd George David Lloyd George, also called (1945) 1st Earl Lloyd- George of Dwyfor, Viscount Gwynedd of Dwyfor, (born Jan. 17, 1863, Manchester, Eng.—died March 26, 1945, Ty- newydd, near Llanystumdwy, Caernarvonshire, Wales), British prime minister (1916–22) who dominated the British political scene in the latter part of World War I. He was raised to the peerage in the year of his death. Early life Lloyd George’s father was a Welshman from Pembrokeshire and had become headmaster of an elementary school in Manchester. His mother was the daughter of David Lloyd, a Baptist minister. His father died in June 1864, leaving Mrs. George in poverty. She moved to Llanystumdwy in Caernarvonshire, where her brother Richard, a shoemaker and Baptist minister, supported her and her children; and it was from him that David Lloyd George imbibed many of his formative beliefs. His uncle enabled him to embark at the age of 14 on the career of a solicitor; he became articled (1879) to a firm at Portmadoc, passing his final examination in 1884. In Wales, as in Ireland, an anglicized and Anglican Tory “ascendancy” class of landed gentry dominated a Celtic people of different race and religion. The causes of the Liberal Party, the Welsh nation, and Nonconformity were inseparable in the atmosphere in which Lloyd George was raised, and he first made his name by a successful battle in the courts to establish the right of Nonconformists to burial in the churchyard of their parish. Ironically, he who came to be the standard-bearer of the oppressed religious sects had lost his faith even as a boy. As a young man, Lloyd George had the romantic good looks that ensured success with women. After numerous love affairs, he was married in 1888 to Margaret Owen, who bore him two sons and three daughters. The marriage cannot be described as happy. Lloyd George was incapable of fidelity, and his affairs with other women were notorious. His wife stood by him on many occasions, but in the end his behaviour was too much for even her long-suffering tolerance. David Lloyd George   David Lloyd George Lloyd George entered Parliament in 1890, winning a by-election at Caernarvon Boroughs, the seat he retained for 55 years. He soon made a name for himself in the House of Commons by his audacity, charm, wit, and mastery of the art of debate. During the 10 years of Liberal opposition that followed the election of 1895, he became a leading figure in the radical wing of the party. He bitterly and courageously opposed the South African War and in 1901 was nearly lynched in Birmingham, the stronghold of Joseph Chamberlain and Conservative imperialism. With the arrival of peace, Lloyd George worked up a great agitation in Wales against tax-aided grants to church schools established by Balfour’s Education Act (1902). Arthur J. Balfour resigned in December 1905, and Sir Henry Campbell-Bannerman formed a Liberal administration, appointing Lloyd George to the Cabinet as president of the Board of Trade. In that office, he was responsible for important legislation: the Merchant Shipping Act (1906), improving seamen’s living conditions, but also endangering their lives by raising the Plimsoll line on newly constructed ships; the Patents and Designs Act (1907), preventing foreign exploitation of British inventions; and the Port of London Act (1908), setting up the Port of London Authority. He also earned a high reputation by his patient work in settling strikes. He suffered a cruel bereavement in November 1907, when his daughter Mair died of appendicitis at the age of 17. Years afterward, the sight of her portrait could plunge him into tears. Chancellor of the Exchequer. Campbell-Bannerman’s health failed in 1908. He was succeeded as prime minister by the chancellor of the Exchequer, Herbert Henry Asquith, who appointed Lloyd George to take his own place. This was a notable promotion and made him at least a strong competitor for the premiership after Asquith. By this time, the Liberal Party’s fortunes were beginning to languish. The House of Lords had blocked much of its social reform legislation, and the radical wing of the party was concerned that its thunder might be stolen by the nascent Labour Party unless the deadlock could be broken. At the same time, the demand for more battleships to match the German naval program threatened the finances available for social reform. It was to meet these difficulties that Lloyd George framed the famous “People’s Budget” of 1909, calling for taxes upon unearned increment on the sale of land and on land values, higher death duties, and a supertax on incomes above £3,000. Moreover, it seemed for a time that the House of Lords’ veto on progressive legislation would be bypassed, since the custom of the constitution forbade the upper house  David Lloyd George   from interfering with the budget. In fact, however, the Conservative majority in the House of Lords, against the advice of some of its wiser members, decided to reject it. The consequences of this rejection were two general elections, a major constitutional crisis, and the ultimate passage of the Parliament Act of 1911, which severely curtailed the powers of the upper house. The principal burden of all this fell upon Asquith, but Lloyd George gave him vigorous support in a series of notable philippics against the aristocracy and the rich. The most famous of all was his speech at Limehouse, where he denounced the rapacity of the landlord class, especially the dukes, in unforgettable language. In 1913 he faced one of the gravest personal crises in his career. In April 1912, along with Rufus Isaacs, the attorney general, he had purchased shares in the Marconi Wireless Telegraph Company of America at a rate well below that available to the general public. The American Marconi company was legally independent of the British concern, but the two companies were closely connected, and the latter’s shares had recently boomed as a result of the government’s decision to accept its proposal to construct a chain of radio stations throughout the empire. Lloyd George and Isaacs denied, in somewhat ambiguous language, any transactions in the shares of “the Marconi company,” a denial that technically referred only to the British company but was generally assumed to cover the American as well. A select committee of the House of Commons revealed the facts and, although by a party majority it acquitted the ministers of blame, Lloyd George’s reputation was damaged. Social reform and the outbreak of war Lloyd George’s major achievement during the years immediately before the war was in the field of social insurance. Inspired by a visit to Germany (1908), where he studied the Bismarckian scheme of insurance benefits, Lloyd George decided to introduce health and unemployment insurance on a similar basis in Britain. This he did in the National Insurance Act of 1911. The measure inspired bitter opposition and was even unpopular with the working class, who were not convinced by Lloyd George’s slogan “ninepence for fourpence,” the difference in these two figures being the employer’s and the state’s contribution. Lloyd George, undeterred, piloted his measure through Parliament with great skill and determination. He thus laid the foundations of the modern welfare state and, if he had done nothing else, would deserve fame for that achievement. Though much of the government’s time during these years was occupied by the Irish question, Lloyd George played little part in it and, on the whole, left foreign policy to his colleagues. It was, therefore, something of a surprise when, in July 1911, after careful  David Lloyd George   consultation with Asquith and Sir Edward Grey, he issued a formidable warning to Germany over the Moroccan crisis. When the question of entry into the war convulsed the Cabinet in late July and early August 1914, he seemed at first to incline to the isolationist section. For a brief moment he contemplated retirement. But the tide of events swept him to the other side. As chancellor, he plunged into the financial problems posed by the war. Minister of munitions and secretary of state for war Throughout the remainder of 1914 and the early months of 1915, Lloyd George was a vigorous advocate of increased munitions production. Here he came into sharp conflict with Lord Kitchener in the War Office. The resignation of Admiral Fisher in 1915 forced Asquith to reconstruct the government on a coalition basis and admit the Conservatives. In the new administration, Lloyd George became minister of munitions. In this capacity, he made one of the most notable contributions to the victory of the Allies. His methods were unorthodox and shocked the civil service, but his energy was immense. He imported able assistants from big business and used his eloquence to induce the cooperation of organized labour. When, in the summer of 1916, the great Battle of the Somme began, supplies were forthcoming. Lloyd George acquired definite views on war strategy at an early stage. He doubted the possibility of breaking through on the Western Front and advocated instead a flank attack from the Near East. He was thus at loggerheads with the view of the official military hierarchy, cogently pressed by Sir Douglas Haig and Sir William Robertson, that the war could only be won in the West. On June 5, 1916, Kitchener was drowned on his way to Russia, when his ship struck a German mine. A last-minute accident—acute developments in the Irish situation—alone had prevented Lloyd George from travelling with him. After some hesitation, Asquith appointed him to the vacant position at the War Office. Lloyd George held the post for five months, but Robertson as chief of the imperial general staff possessed nearly all the important powers of the war minister. Lloyd George chafed under these restrictions, the more so because he disagreed with Robertson on issues of strategy. Thus frustrated, he began to survey the whole direction of the war with increasing skepticism; and he did not conceal his doubts from his friends who, by the end of November, had become convinced that Asquith should delegate the day-to-day running of the war to a small committee whose chairman should be Lloyd George. There was undoubtedly widespread uneasiness at Asquith’s conduct of affairs, particularly in the Conservative Party. Asquith was manoeuvred into resigning on December 5 and was  David Lloyd George   replaced two days later by Lloyd George. He was supported by the leading Conservatives, but the most prominent Liberal ministers resigned with Asquith. Prime minister Lloyd George was now 54 and at the height of his powers. His energy, eloquence, and ability had already made him the leading statesman of the day, and his accession to the premiership was highly popular in the country generally. He immediately substituted a small War Cabinet of five, which was to be in constant session, for the body of 23 that had hitherto conducted affairs. The result was a general speeding up of decisions. One of Lloyd George’s most notable efforts was in combating the submarine menace, which, in early 1917, threatened to starve Britain into submission. He achieved this by forcing the adoption of the convoy system upon a reluctant Admiralty. The food shortage resulting from the submarine war was acute. Drastic action had to be taken to step up agricultural production, and eventually a system of food rationing had to be introduced (1918). In these matters Lloyd George was at his best, contemptuous of red tape, determined to take action and to make his will prevail. It was in the field of grand strategy that he was least successful. Lloyd George remained profoundly skeptical of the ability of the British high command to conduct even a “Western” strategy successfully. Without warning Haig or Robertson in advance, he confronted them at the Calais Conference of February 1917 with a plan to place the British army under French command for General Robert-Georges Nivelle’s forthcoming offensive. Haig and Robertson deeply distrusted Lloyd George from that moment onward. The Nivelle offensive was a total failure, and Lloyd George was, as a result, on shaky ground when he endeavoured to resist Haig’s proposals for a major British campaign in Flanders in the summer. After much hesitation, he gave way, and on July 31, 1917, the ill-fated Passchendaele offensive began. Although it may have forestalled a possible German attack on the French, Passchendaele, with enormous loss of life, achieved none of its main objectives. Lloyd George was now convinced of the incompetence of the British high command. He still dared not take action against them openly. Instead, he began what Sir Winston Churchill called “a series of extremely laborious and mystifying maneuvers,” with the  David Lloyd George   object of creating a unified command under someone other than Haig. In February 1918 Robertson offered his resignation, which Lloyd George accepted, but Haig remained as commander in chief. Such was Lloyd George’s distrust of Haig that, during the winter of 1917–18, he had deliberately kept him short of troops for fear that he might renew the attack. The result was that the German commander, General Erich Ludendorff, came near to launching a successful offensive against the British sector in March 1918. The emergency caused a unified command under Marshal Ferdinand Foch to be established (April), and by May the situation had stabilized. The tide now turned, and the Western Allies launched a series of successful attacks upon the exhausted Germans. The Armistice of November 1918 presented Lloyd George with a dilemma. Should he allow a return to peacetime party politics or continue the coalition? There was little doubt of the answer. The leader of the Conservatives, Bonar Law, was willing to cooperate. A somewhat perfunctory offer to include Asquith was declined. The ensuing election in December gave the coalitionists an overwhelming victory. The rift between Lloyd George and Asquith’s supporters was now wider than ever, however, and Lloyd George was now largely dependent on Conservative support. As one of the three great statesmen at Versailles, Lloyd George must bear a major responsibility for the peace settlement. He pursued a middle course between Georges Clemenceau and Woodrow Wilson. But, throughout, Lloyd George was under pressure to pursue the more draconian policy of Clemenceau. It is to his credit that the final settlement was not far worse than it was. The treaty was well received in Britain, and in August 1919 the king conferred on Lloyd George the Order of Merit. A major domestic problem was Ireland, where the Sinn Fein refused to recognize the British Parliament. From 1919 to 1921 a civil war raged. In the summer of 1921, Lloyd George, with full agreement of his Conservative colleagues, reversed the policy of repression in Ireland and began the negotiations that culminated in Irish independence in December 1921. The more rigid Tories never forgave this “surrender,” as they deemed it. In 1922 Lloyd George ran into trouble over the so-called honours scandal, when accusations were made that peerages and other honours were being sold for large campaign contributions. Tory discontent was rife, when, from a wholly unexpected quarter, a crisis occurred that drove Lloyd George from power forever. This was the Çanak incident, in  David Lloyd George   which it seemed to critics that the reckless foreign policy of the government had led Britain to the verge of an unnecessary war with Turkey. When the Conservative leaders decided to appeal to the country on a coalition basis once again, a party revolt ensued. Bonar Law, who had retired because of ill health in 1921, returned to the political scene. On Oct. 19, 1922, a two-to-one majority of Conservative members of Parliament endorsed his and Stanley Baldwin’s plea to fight as an independent party. Lloyd George at once resigned. Later years and assessment The long twilight of Lloyd George’s career was a melancholy anticlimax. The feud with the Asquithians was never healed, and from 1926 to 1931 he headed an ailing Liberal Party. He devoted himself thereafter to writing his War Memoirs (1933–36) and The Truth About the Peace Treaties (1938).

Dolley Madison
Dolley Madison, née Dolley Payne, also called
(1790–93) Dolley Todd, Dolley also spelled Dolly,
(born May 20, 1768, Guilford county, North Carolina
[U.S.]—died July 12, 1849, Washington, D.C., U.S.),
American first lady (1809–17), the wife of James
Madison, fourth president of the United States.
Raised in the plain style of her Quaker family, she
was renowned for her charm, warmth, and ingenuity. Her popularity as manager of the
White House made that task a responsibility of every first lady who followed.
Dolley was one of eight children of John Payne, a merchant, and Mary Coles Payne. Soon
after her birth, her father’s business fell on hard times and the family moved to eastern
Virginia, where they were active members of the Society of Friends. When she was 15 her
family moved to Philadelphia, where Dolley married a young lawyer, John Todd, in 1790.
The couple had two children, but in 1793 her youngest son and husband died during an
epidemic of yellow fever, widowing Dolley at 25.
A few months later Aaron Burr, then a United States
senator from New Jersey, introduced Dolley to James
Madison, who was 17 years her senior; though a
small man physically he was a towering political
figure. There was a mutual, immediate, and strong
attraction between James and Dolley, and they wed
on September 15, 1794, at her sister’s home in
Virginia. Because her husband was Episcopalian, however, the Quakers disowned her.
Soon after their marriage, accompanied by her son, the Madisons moved to Philadelphia,
then the nation’s capital, where James served as a member of the House of Representatives.
During the presidency of John Adams (1797–1801), the Madisons lived on James’s estate,
Montpellier (now Montpelier), in Virginia. Soon after the election of Thomas Jefferson in
1800, they relocated to Washington, D.C., where James served as secretary of state and
Dolley assisted the widowed Jefferson as hostess at official events, giving her ample
preparation for her future role as first lady.
The first president’s wife to preside over the White House for any significant amount of
time, Dolley Madison set many precedents. She established the tradition that the mansion

Dolley Madison
would reflect the first lady’s tastes and ideas about entertaining. With the help of Benjamin
Latrobe, architect and surveyor of public buildings, she decorated and furnished the house
so that it was both elegant and comfortable. Unfortunately, not many Americans had the
chance to see it before the British burned the mansion in August 1814 during the War of
1812. Dolley underscored the first lady’s responsibility for caring for the mansion and its
contents when she directed the removal and safe storage of precious holdings, including the
famous Gilbert Stuart portrait of George Washington that still hangs in the East Room.
As hostess, Dolley Madison carefully balanced two
competing traditions in the new nation: the
democratic emphasis on equal treatment and the
elitist notion that the president’s house was the
province of the privileged few. At weekly receptions
she opened the doors to virtually anyone who wanted
to come and then moved among the guests, greeting
all with charming ease. In her stylish turbans and imported clothes, she became enormously
popular and much imitated. Although most Americans approved, she did have her critics,
including Elijah Mills, a senator from Massachusetts, who complained that she mixed “all
classes of people…greasy boots and silk stockings.”
Although she eschewed taking public stands on controversial issues, Dolley had a shrewd
political sense and cultivated her husband’s enemies as carefully as his friends. When
President Madison dismissed his secretary of state, Robert Smith, she invited him to
dinner; when he failed to accept she went to call on him personally. In the election of 1812,
when many Americans complained that Madison had led them into an unnecessary war, she
used her invitation lists to win him favour and a second term, according to some historians.
She insisted on visiting the household of every new representative or senator, a task that
proved very time-consuming as the nation grew and the number of congressmen increased.
Since many representatives chose to bring their families to Washington, dozens of
households expected a call from the president’s wife. Her successors found the practice too
burdensome and stopped it.
Dolley Madison enjoyed a happy marriage; different as she and her husband were in
personality, they doted on each other. However, her relationship with her son, John Payne
Todd, was a different matter. He spent money recklessly and expected his mother to cover
his debts and losses.

Dolley Madison
When James’s second term ended in 1817, he and
Dolley moved back to Montpellier, where they lived
until his death in 1836. James’s last decades were not
prosperous, and the debts of young Payne Todd
depleted the family’s resources. To supplement
Dolley’s income after James’s death, a sympathetic
and grateful Congress appropriated $30,000 to
purchase the Madison papers.
In 1837 Dolley moved back to Washington. Living in a home opposite the White House,
she was the nation’s most prestigious hostess. Presidents and social leaders called on her,
and she was a frequent White House guest. But her profligate son continued to try her
patience and deplete her purse. In 1842 she traveled to New York City to arrange a loan
from the wealthy fur magnate John Jacob Astor, and Congress came to her aid once more

Raised in the plain style of her Quaker family, she was renowned for her charm, warmth, and ingenuity. Her popularity as manager of the White House made that task a responsibility of every first lady who followed. Dolley was one of eight children of John Payne, a merchant, and Mary Coles Payne.

Dolley underscored the first lady’s responsibility for caring for the mansion and its contents when she directed the removal and safe storage of precious holdings, including the famous Gilbert Stuart portrait of George Washington that still hangs in the East Room.

Duy Tan
Duy Tan, original name Vinh San, (born 1899—died Dec. 26, 1945), emperor of Vietnam
from 1907 to 1916 and symbol of the Vietnamese anticolonialist movement against the
French before and during World War I; he became an officer and decorated hero in the
French army during World War II.
Vinh San was the son of Emperor Thanh Thai, who was deposed by the French. Seeking a
more compliant figure to be their puppet king, the French proclaimed Vinh San emperor on
Sept. 5, 1907. Upon his accession, he assumed the name Duy Tan, or reform(s), the
Chinese characters of which were the same as the name of a radical nationalist
organization, Duy Tan Hoi (“Reformation Society”), founded about that time by the
Vietnamese patriots Nguyen Tham and Phan Boi Chau.
Duy Tan was sympathetic to the plans of the Vietnamese liberation leaders, who needed the
symbol and sanction of royalty to win popular support. He cooperated with rebel plans to
stage revolts in the provinces of Thua Thien, Quang Nam, and Quang Ngai in central
Vietnam in 1916. Details of the plot, however, leaked to the French. The attacks were
unsuccessful, and Duy Tan was caught trying to escape to a mountain sanctuary; on May
13, 1916, he was dethroned by the French and exiled to Réunion island, off the coast of
Madagascar, in the Indian Ocean.
During World War II Duy Tan served in Europe with the Free French Army as Major Vinh
San. He was among the early followers of the Free French leader General Charles de
Gaulle and was awarded the highest French honours for bravery, most importantly cited as
“Companion of the French Liberation.” He was killed in an airplane crash and is buried in
what is now the Central African Republic.

Eamon de Valera
Eamon de Valera
Eamon de Valera, original name Edward de Valera,
(born Oct. 14, 1882, New York, N.Y., U.S.—died
Aug. 29, 1975, Dublin, Ire.), Irish politician and
patriot, who served as taoiseach (prime minister;
1932–48, 1951–54, 1957–59) and president (1959–
73) of Ireland. An active revolutionary from 1913, he
became president of Sinn Féin in 1917 and founded
the Fianna Fáil party in 1926. In 1937 he made his country a “sovereign” state, renamed
Ireland, or Éire. His academic attainments also inspired wide respect; he became chancellor
of the National University of Ireland in 1921.
Early life
De Valera’s father, who was Spanish, died when the boy was two. De Valera was then sent
to his mother’s family in County Limerick, Ire., and studied at the local national school and
at Blackrock College, Dublin; he graduated from the Royal University, Dublin, and became
a teacher of mathematics and an ardent supporter of the Irish-language revival. In 1913 he
joined the Irish Volunteers, which had been organized to resist opposition to Home Rule for
Ireland.
In the anti-British Easter Rising in Dublin (1916), de Valera commanded an occupied
building and was the last commander to surrender. Because of his American birth, he
escaped execution by the British but was sentenced to penal servitude. Released in 1917
but arrested again and deported in May 1918 to England, where he was imprisoned, de
Valera was acclaimed by the Irish as the chief survivor of the uprising and in October 1917
was elected president of the revolutionist Sinn Féin (“We Ourselves” or “Ourselves
Alone”) party, which won three-fourths of all the Irish constituencies in December 1918.
After a dramatic escape from Lincoln Jail in February 1919, de Valera went in disguise to
the United States, where he collected funds. He returned to Ireland before the Anglo-Irish
War (Irish War of Independence) ended with the truce that took effect on July 11, 1921, and
appointed plenipotentiaries to negotiate in London. He repudiated the treaty of Dec. 6,
1921, that they signed to form the Irish Free State, however, primarily because it imposed
an oath of allegiance to the British crown.
Rise to power

After Dáil Éireann (Irish Assembly) ratified the treaty by a small majority (1922), de Valera
supported the republican resistance in the ensuing civil war. William Thomas Cosgrave’s
Irish Free State ministry imprisoned him, but he was released in 1924 and then organized a
republican opposition party that would not sit in Dáil Éireann (now the lower house of the
Oireachtas, the Irish parliament). In 1927, however, he persuaded his followers to sign the
oath of allegiance as “an empty political formula,” and his new Fianna Fáil (“Soldiers of
Destiny”) party then entered the Dáil, demanding abolition of the oath of allegiance, of the
governor-general, of the Seanad (senate) as then constituted, and of land-purchase annuities
payable to Great Britain. The Cosgrave ministry was defeated by Fianna Fáil in 1932, and
de Valera, as head of the new ministry, embarked quickly on severing connections with
Great Britain. He withheld payment of the land annuities, and an “economic war” resulted.
Increasing retaliation by both sides enabled de Valera to develop his program of austere
national self-sufficiency in an Irish-speaking Ireland while building up industries behind
protective tariffs. In a new constitution ratified by referendum in 1937, the Irish Free State
became Ireland (in Irish, Éire), a sovereign, independent democracy tenuously linked with
the British Commonwealth (under the External Relations Act of 1936) only for purposes of
diplomatic representation.
De Valera’s prestige was enhanced by his success as president of the council of the League
of Nations in 1932 and of its assembly in 1938. He also entered negotiations with British
Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain in which he guaranteed that he would never allow
Ireland to be used as a base for attacking Britain in the event of war. This culminated in the
Anglo-Irish defense agreement of April 1938, whereby Britain relinquished the naval bases
of Cobh, Berehaven, and Lough Swilly (retained in a defense annex to the 1921 treaty), and
in complementary finance and trade treaties that ended the economic war. This made
possible de Valera’s proclamation in September 1939, upon the outbreak of World War II,
that Ireland would remain neutral and would resist attack from any quarter. In secret,
however, de Valera also authorized significant military and intelligence assistance to both
the British and the Americans throughout the war; he realized that a German victory would
imperil Ireland’s independence, of which neutrality was the ultimate expression. By
avoiding the burdens and destruction of the war, de Valera achieved a relative prosperity
for Ireland in comparison with the war-torn countries of Europe, and he retained office in
subsequent elections.
In 1948 a reaction against the long monopoly of power and patronage held by de Valera’s
party enabled the opposition, with the help of smaller parties, to form an interparty
government under John A. Costello. Ironically, this precarious coalition collapsed within

three years after Ireland became a republic by means of the repeal of the External Relations
Act of 1936 and the severance of all ties with the British Commonwealth, an act de Valera
had avoided. De Valera resumed office until 1954, when he appealed unsuccessfully for a
fresh mandate, and Costello formed his second interparty ministry. No clearly defined
difference now existed between the opposing parties in face of rising prices, continued
emigration, and a backward agriculture. De Valera claimed, however, that a strong single-
party government was indispensable and that all coalitions must be weak and insecure. On
this plea he obtained, in March 1957, the overall majority that he demanded.
In 1959 de Valera agreed to stand as a candidate for the presidency. He resigned his
position as taoiseach and leader of the Fianna Fáil party. In June he was elected president,
and he was reelected in 1966. He retired to a nursing home near Dublin in 1973 and died
there in 1975.
Summary
De Valera’s career spanned the dramatic period of Ireland’s modern cultural and national
revolution. As an anticolonial leader, a skillful constitutionalist, and a symbol of national
liberation, de Valera dominated Ireland in the half century following the country’s
independence.

An active revolutionary from 1913, he became president of Sinn Féin in 1917 and founded the Fianna Fáil party in 1926. In 1937 he made his country a “sovereign” state, renamed Ireland, or Éire. His academic attainments also inspired wide respect; he became chancellor of the National University of Ireland in 1921. Early life De Valera’s father, who was Spanish, died when the boy was two. De Valera was then sent to his mother’s family in County Limerick, Ire., and studied at the local national school and at Blackrock College, Dublin; he graduated from the Royal University, Dublin, and became a teacher of mathematics and an ardent supporter of the Irish-language revival. In 1913 he joined the Irish Volunteers, which had been organized to resist opposition to Home Rule for Ireland. In the anti-British Easter Rising in Dublin (1916), de Valera commanded an occupied building and was the last commander to surrender. Because of his American birth, he escaped execution by the British but was sentenced to penal servitude. Released in 1917 but arrested again and deported in May 1918 to England, where he was imprisoned, de Valera was acclaimed by the Irish as the chief survivor of the uprising and in October 1917 was elected president of the revolutionist Sinn Féin (“We Ourselves” or “Ourselves Alone”) party, which won three-fourths of all the Irish constituencies in December 1918. After a dramatic escape from Lincoln Jail in February 1919, de Valera went in disguise to the United States, where he collected funds. He returned to Ireland before the Anglo-Irish War (Irish War of Independence) ended with the truce that took effect on July 11, 1921, and appointed plenipotentiaries to negotiate in London. He repudiated the treaty of Dec. 6, 1921, that they signed to form the Irish Free State, however, primarily because it imposed an oath of allegiance to the British crown. Rise to power  Eamon de Valera   After Dáil Éireann (Irish Assembly) ratified the treaty by a small majority (1922), de Valera supported the republican resistance in the ensuing civil war. William Thomas Cosgrave’s Irish Free State ministry imprisoned him, but he was released in 1924 and then organized a republican opposition party that would not sit in Dáil Éireann (now the lower house of the Oireachtas, the Irish parliament). In 1927, however, he persuaded his followers to sign the oath of allegiance as “an empty political formula,” and his new Fianna Fáil (“Soldiers of Destiny”) party then entered the Dáil, demanding abolition of the oath of allegiance, of the governor-general, of the Seanad (senate) as then constituted, and of land-purchase annuities payable to Great Britain. The Cosgrave ministry was defeated by Fianna Fáil in 1932, and de Valera, as head of the new ministry, embarked quickly on severing connections with Great Britain. He withheld payment of the land annuities, and an “economic war” resulted. Increasing retaliation by both sides enabled de Valera to develop his program of austere national self-sufficiency in an Irish-speaking Ireland while building up industries behind protective tariffs. In a new constitution ratified by referendum in 1937, the Irish Free State became Ireland (in Irish, Éire), a sovereign, independent democracy tenuously linked with the British Commonwealth (under the External Relations Act of 1936) only for purposes of diplomatic representation. De Valera’s prestige was enhanced by his success as president of the council of the League of Nations in 1932 and of its assembly in 1938. He also entered negotiations with British Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain in which he guaranteed that he would never allow Ireland to be used as a base for attacking Britain in the event of war. This culminated in the Anglo-Irish defense agreement of April 1938, whereby Britain relinquished the naval bases of Cobh, Berehaven, and Lough Swilly (retained in a defense annex to the 1921 treaty), and in complementary finance and trade treaties that ended the economic war. This made possible de Valera’s proclamation in September 1939, upon the outbreak of World War II, that Ireland would remain neutral and would resist attack from any quarter. In secret, however, de Valera also authorized significant military and intelligence assistance to both the British and the Americans throughout the war; he realized that a German victory would imperil Ireland’s independence, of which neutrality was the ultimate expression. By avoiding the burdens and destruction of the war, de Valera achieved a relative prosperity for Ireland in comparison with the war-torn countries of Europe, and he retained office in subsequent elections. In 1948 a reaction against the long monopoly of power and patronage held by de Valera’s party enabled the opposition, with the help of smaller parties, to form an interparty government under John A. Costello. Ironically, this precarious coalition collapsed within  Eamon de Valera   three years after Ireland became a republic by means of the repeal of the External Relations Act of 1936 and the severance of all ties with the British Commonwealth, an act de Valera had avoided. De Valera resumed office until 1954, when he appealed unsuccessfully for a fresh mandate, and Costello formed his second interparty ministry. No clearly defined difference now existed between the opposing parties in face of rising prices, continued emigration, and a backward agriculture. De Valera claimed, however, that a strong single- party government was indispensable and that all coalitions must be weak and insecure. On this plea he obtained, in March 1957, the overall majority that he demanded. In 1959 de Valera agreed to stand as a candidate for the presidency. He resigned his position as taoiseach and leader of the Fianna Fáil party. In June he was elected president, and he was reelected in 1966. He retired to a nursing home near Dublin in 1973 and died there in 1975. Summary De Valera’s career spanned the dramatic period of Ireland’s modern cultural and national revolution. As an anticolonial leader, a skillful constitutionalist, and a symbol of national liberation, de Valera dominated Ireland in the half century following the country’s independence.

Edmund Pendleton
Edmund Pendleton, (born Sept. 9, 1721, Caroline County, Virginia—died Oct. 26, 1803,
Caroline County, Va., U.S.), Virginia patriot during the American Revolution.
Pendleton’s father and grandfather died the year of his birth, and the young man grew up
without paternal care. Apprenticed at the age of 14 to the clerk of the Caroline County
court, Pendleton acquired a legal education, and in 1741 he was admitted to the bar.
In 1751 Pendleton became a justice of the peace, and the following year he was elected to
the House of Burgesses. A conservative, he clashed repeatedly with Patrick Henry (whom
Pendleton considered a demagogue) over Henry’s radical opposition to the Stamp Act and
other divisive issues between Britain and the American colonies. Pendleton did charge that
Parliament had exceeded its authority in passing the Stamp Act, and he soon emerged as a
leader among the patriots.
Selected in 1773 as a member of Virginia’s Committee of Correspondence, Pendleton
represented the colony at the first Continental Congress in 1774. In 1775 he served as
president of the Virginia Committee of Public Safety, which acted as a temporary
government during the critical period just prior to independence. At the Virginia convention
of 1776, Pendleton drew up the instructions to Virginia’s representatives in Congress,
directing them to propose a declaration of independence. He later helped revise the laws of
Virginia and helped draft the state’s first constitution.
Under the new constitution, Pendleton served as first speaker of Virginia’s House of
Delegates. In 1779 he became president of the supreme court of appeals, but except for
trips to Richmond in order to preside, he spent much of the remainder of his life at his
estate, “Edmunsbury,” in Caroline County. He nonetheless exerted influence over national
affairs by corresponding regularly with his friends in Congress, especially James Madison.
Elected president of Virginia’s ratifying convention in 1788, Pendleton vigorously
supported acceptance of the new federal Constitution. He thereafter refused several
positions in the national government offered by his long-time friend George Washington
and spent his final years at his Virginia estate.

Emilio Aguinaldo
Emilio Aguinaldo
Emilio Aguinaldo, (born March 22/23, 1869, near
Cavite, Luzon, Philippines—died February 6, 1964,
Quezon City), Filipino leader and politician who
fought first against Spain and later against the United
States for the independence of the Philippines.
Early life, Spanish-American War, and
the struggle for the independence of the Philippines
Aguinaldo was of Chinese and Tagalog parentage. He attended San Juan de Letrán College
in Manila but left school early to help his mother run the family farm. In August 1896 he
was mayor of Cavite Viejo (present-day Kawit; adjacent to Cavite city) and was the local
leader of the Katipunan, a revolutionary society that fought bitterly and successfully
against the Spanish. In December 1897 he signed an agreement called the Pact of Biac-na-
Bató with the Spanish governor general. Aguinaldo agreed to leave the Philippines and to
remain permanently in exile on condition of a substantial financial reward from Spain
coupled with the promise of liberal reforms. While first in Hong Kong and then in
Singapore, he made arrangements with representatives of the American consulates and of
Commodore George Dewey to return to the Philippines to assist the United States in the
war against Spain.
Aguinaldo returned to the Philippines on May 19, 1898, and announced renewal of the
struggle with Spain. The Filipinos, who declared their independence from Spain on June
12, 1898, proclaimed a provisional republic, of which Aguinaldo was to become president,
and in September a revolutionary assembly met and ratified Filipino independence.
However, the Philippines, along with Puerto Rico and Guam, were ceded by Spain to the
United States by the Treaty of Paris, which was signed on December 10, 1898.
Relations between the Americans and the Filipinos were unfriendly and grew steadily
worse. On January 23, 1899, the Malolos Constitution—by virtue of which the Philippines
was declared a republic and which had been approved by the assembly and by Aguinaldo—
was proclaimed. Aguinaldo, who had been president of the provisional government, was
elected president.

Philippine-American War: burning
of the Malolos headquarters of
Emilio Aguinaldo
Philippine-American War
On the night of February 4 the inevitable conflict
between the Americans and Filipinos surrounding
Manila was precipitated. By the morning of February
5 the Filipinos, who had fought bravely, had been
defeated at all points. While the fighting was in
progress, Aguinaldo issued a proclamation of war
against the United States, which immediately sent
reinforcements to the Philippines. The Filipino
government fled northward. In November 1899 the Filipinos resorted to guerrilla warfare.
After three years of costly fighting, the insurrection
was finally brought to an end when, in a daring
operation on March 23, 1901, led by Gen. Frederick
Funston, Aguinaldo was captured in his secret
headquarters at Palanan in northern Luzon. Aguinaldo
took an oath of allegiance to the United States, was
granted a pension from the U.S. government, and
retired to private life.
In 1935 the commonwealth government of the Philippines was established in preparation
for independence. Aguinaldo ran for president, but he was decisively beaten. He returned to
private life until the Japanese invaded the Philippines in December 1941. The Japanese
used Aguinaldo as an anti-American tool. He made speeches and signed articles. In early
1942 he addressed a radio appeal to U.S. Gen. Douglas MacArthur—who at that time was
with the U.S. garrison holding out against the Japanese on Corregidor Island—to surrender
(the troops there did surrender in May 1942, but MacArthur had already been evacuated).
The Americans returned to the Philippines in late 1944, and, after they had retaken Manila
in 1945, Aguinaldo was arrested. He and others accused of collaboration with the Japanese
were imprisoned for some months before they were released by presidential amnesty. In
1950 Aguinaldo was appointed by Pres. Elpidio Quirino as a member of the Council of
State. In his later years he devoted much attention to veterans’ affairs, the promotion of
nationalism and democracy in the Philippines, and the improvement of relations between
the Philippines and the United States.

Eric Williams, in full Eric Eustace Williams, (born Sept. 25, 1911, Port of Spain,
Trinidad—died March 29, 1981, St. Anne, near Port of Spain), first and longtime prime
minister of independent Trinidad and Tobago (1962–81), who founded (1956) the People’s
National Movement (PNM) and led his country to independence.
Williams was educated at Queen’s Royal College, Port of Spain, and at the University of
Oxford, from which he received a B.A. in 1932 and a D.Phil. in 1938, with studies in
history and political science. In 1939 he went to the United States and joined the faculty of
social and political science at Howard University. While he was at Howard, Williams
became associated with the Caribbean Commission that was established by the United
States, Great Britain, France, and the Netherlands in an effort to coordinate the economic
development of the Caribbean area. His aggressive, commanding role in the commission,
however, tended to alienate the national powers, especially the United States, and in 1955–
56 he organized the PNM party, which won the 1956 general elections. He became chief
minister in the country’s first party government, and, with the achievement of internal self-
government in 1959, he served as premier. The PNM won the December 1961 elections by
a landslide. Williams became prime minister of the colony and then of the new nation upon
its achieving independence in August 1962. He made the country a republic in 1976.
As prime minister, Williams practiced what was called “pragmatic socialism,” which
stressed social services, improved education, and economic development through the
cautious attraction of foreign investment capital. The policy was fruitful in making
Trinidad and Tobago the wealthiest Commonwealth Caribbean nation. He was successively
reelected and served as prime minister until his death.
Williams was the author of a number of books, among which were The Negro in the
Caribbean (1942), Capitalism and Slavery (1944), History of the People of Trinidad and
Tobago (1962), British Historians and the West Indies (1964), Inward Hunger: The
Education of a Prime Minister (1969), and From Columbus to Castro: The History of the
Caribbean, 1492–1969 (1970).

Eugenio María de Hostos, in full Eugenio María de Hostos y Bonilla, (born January 11,
1839, near Mayagüez, Puerto Rico—died August 11, 1903, Santo Domingo, Dominican
Republic), educator and writer who was an early advocate of self-government for the island
of Puerto Rico.
Hostos was educated in Spain and became active in republican politics as a university
student there. He left Spain when that country’s new constitution (1869) refused to grant
autonomy to Puerto Rico. He went to the United States, where he became editor of the
Cuban independence journal La Revolución in 1870. He subsequently traveled widely
throughout South America and taught in Chile. He returned to the United States in 1898
and participated actively in the Cuban independence movement, but his hopes for Puerto
Rican self-government after the Spanish-American War (1898) were disappointed when the
U.S. government rejected his proposal for autonomy and instead established its rule over
the island as a territory. Hostos returned to the Dominican Republic, where he remained
until his death.
Hostos played a major role in reorganizing the educational system of the Dominican
Republic. He wrote many essays and treatises on social science topics and was one of the
first systematic sociologists in Latin America.

Faisal I
Faisal I
Faisal I, Faisal also spelled Fayṣal, (born May 20,
1885, Mecca, Ottoman Empire [now in Saudi Arabia]
—died September 8, 1933, Bern, Switzerland), Arab
statesman and king of Iraq (1921–33) who was a
leader in advancing Arab nationalism during and after
World War I.
Faisal was the son of Hussein ibn Ali, emir and grand sharif of Mecca who ruled the Hejaz
from 1916 to 1924. When World War I provided an opportunity for rebellion for many Arab
leaders who had come to resent Ottoman rule, including certain Syrian Arabs who looked
to Hussein for leadership because he was not under direct Ottoman rule, Faisal in 1915
traveled to Damascus to reach an understanding with the secret Arab nationalist societies
there about the terms under which they would support an Arab revolt led by Hussein.
Faisal’s ability to meet with diverse groups previously unknown to him and to win their
recognition of Hussein as an Arab leader indicated the existence of a nascent Arab
nationalism.
When in the following year the Arab revolt was declared, Faisal played an important part in
the military campaigns against the Ottomans. An Arab military force occupied Damascus in
September 1918, and Faisal was declared king of Syria in accord with his understanding
that Arab support for British military ambitions would be rewarded by British support for
the creation of an Arab state consisting of most of Syria. When Faisal went to Paris in 1919
to participate in the peace conference, however, he became clearly aware of French
determination to establish a sphere of influence in Lebanon and Syria. Realizing that he
would have to make concessions, he negotiated the agreement accepting French military
occupation of Lebanon and the Syrian coastal regions as far north as Alexandretta (now
Iskenderun, Turkey). In January 1920 he returned to Damascus, where he was unable to
calm the violent resentment aroused by the news of French pretensions. Most Arab leaders
did not understand the futility of resisting French military power and the consequent
pressures under which he had laboured in Paris. When France soon found reason to invade
Faisal’s kingdom and occupy Damascus (July 1920), Faisal himself was forced into exile,
and he eventually went to London at the invitation of the British government.
Meanwhile, Britain had established a sphere of influence in Iraq. To ease resistance to
British rule, Britain decided in March 1921 to sponsor Faisal as king of an Iraqi

government with which Britain would conclude a treaty providing for eventual
independence. Faisal accepted the plan and was enthusiastically welcomed in Iraq, where
he was crowned in August 1921. His ability to command widespread support in Iraq as well
as Syria provided a continuing indication of nationalistic feeling among Arabs of the entire
Fertile Crescent. Indeed, as a Pan-Arab leader, he had no specific political roots in Iraq,
deriving his authority by moderating various conflicting elements. He valued British
friendship while maintaining his full credentials among fervent Arab nationalists as their
leader. From his position of influence, he negotiated with Britain a series of treaties
culminating in 1930 with a treaty that enabled Iraq to achieve complete independence and
membership in the League of Nations by 1932.

Felice Orsini, (born December 10, 1819, Meldola,
Papal States [now in Italy]—died March 13, 1858,
Paris, France), Italian nationalist revolutionary and
conspirator who tried to assassinate the French
emperor Napoleon III.
A follower of the Italian revolutionary leader
Giuseppe Mazzini, Orsini participated in the uprisings in Rome in 1848–49, thereafter
serving as Mazzini’s agent in Switzerland, Hungary, and England. After a daring escape
from an Austrian prison in Mantua in 1855, he went to London and wrote two accounts of
his adventures—The Austrian Dungeons in Italy (1856) and Memoirs and Adventures of F.
Orsini Written by Himself (1857)—which were extremely popular with the British public.
Orsini broke with Mazzini in 1857 and, emotionally disturbed, began to plot the
assassination of Napoleon III, impelled by the notion that the emperor’s death would
trigger in France a revolution that would spread to Italy. On the night of January 14, 1858,
he and two accomplices threw bombs at the carriage of Napoleon and Empress Eugénie as
they were going to the opera in Paris; although several persons were killed, the intended
victims were unhurt. Orsini was arrested and executed.
Ironically, following Orsini’s attack, Napoleon, remembering the pro-Italian sympathies of
his youth, was prompted to declare war on Austria in 1859, from which Italy’s

Ferenc Deák
Ferenc Deák
Ferenc Deák, byname The Sage Of The Country,
Hungarian A Haza Bölcse, (born Oct. 17, 1803, Söjtör,
Hung., Austrian Empire [now in Hungary]—died Jan.
28/29, 1876, Budapest), Hungarian statesman whose
negotiations led to the establishment of the dual monarchy
of Austria-Hungary in 1867.
Deák was the son of a wealthy Hungarian landowner. After graduating in law, he entered
the administrative service of his county of Zala, which in 1833 sent him to represent it in
the Hungarian Diet, in place of his brother, who had resigned his mandate. At that Diet and
those of 1839 and 1841, Deák made his mark as a leader of the growing reform movement
for the political emancipation and internal regeneration of Hungary. Reelected in 1843, he
declined his mandate in protest against the scandalous manner in which the election had
been conducted, but by this time his unimpeachable integrity, unvarying good sense, and
encyclopaedic knowledge of the law had made him the most generally respected figure in
his camp. It was he who, in 1847, drafted for the “national opposition” its program of
reform for the Diet of 1847. Ill health prevented him from seeking election to that body, but
when, in March 1848, the crown sanctioned the establishment of an independent Hungarian
ministry, the new minister president, Count Lajos Batthyány, insisted on his taking the
portfolio of justice.
As minister of justice, Deák was mainly responsible for the drafting of the reforming
“April Laws” sanctioned by the monarch on April 11, 1848. During the next months, he
took part in most of the negotiations between the Hungarian government and its opponents.
He ceased to be minister when Batthyány resigned on September 28, and he refused
reappointment, but in January 1849 he was a member of another mission that sought to
intervene with Alfred, Fürst zu Windischgrätz, commander of the Austrian armies that had
occupied Buda. Prevented from rejoining the Diet, he retired to his family estates, where he
lived quietly for some years, unmolested by the Austrian authorities, who had decided that
his activities had not been treasonable, but refusing all invitations to collaborate with a
regime that he condemned as illegal. In 1854 he sold his estates—donating the bulk of the
proceeds to his sister—and moved to Pest, taking up quarters in the Hotel Angol Királyné,
which remained his home until his last illness.

In Pest, Deák became the oracle of all those who sought a practical and honourable way out
of Hungary’s political impasse. Because Deák adamantly refused to recognize any regime
that did not grant the legal validity of the April Laws, a Diet convoked in 1861 was
dissolved and absolutist monarchy reimposed. As his international difficulties gradually
convinced Emperor Francis Joseph of the need for reconciliation with Hungary, Deák, in
both private conversations and public utterances, notably his famous “Easter Article” of
April 16, 1865, put forward Hungary’s conditions in terms that presently led to the
Compromise (Ausgleich) of 1867, by which the dual monarchy was established.
Deák was beyond question the originator of the Compromise. The machinery that it
embodied was not all of his devising, but it was his faith that a constitutionally satisfied
Hungary and a strong monarchy could and must coexist that made the agreement possible;
nor could agreement have been reached without his sagacity, resolution, and integrity and
the faith that these qualities inspired in both camps.
His adherents during the negotiations had styled themselves the “Deák Party.” He helped to
complete the legislation deriving from the Compromise and defended it in Parliament when
necessary. His health began to fail; his last public speech was made in November 1873.
The Compromise was the crowning achievement of Deák’s life work, but there was hardly
a field of public life in which he did not exercise his influence, and always on the side of
humanity, reasoned reform, and good sense. He was a foremost fighter for the reform of the
conditions of the Hungarian peasantry, setting the example on his own estates.

Deák was the son of a wealthy Hungarian landowner. After graduating in law, he entered the administrative service of his county of Zala, which in 1833 sent him to represent it in the Hungarian Diet, in place of his brother, who had resigned his mandate. At that Diet and those of 1839 and 1841, Deák made his mark as a leader of the growing reform movement for the political emancipation and internal regeneration of Hungary. Reelected in 1843, he declined his mandate in protest against the scandalous manner in which the election had been conducted, but by this time his unimpeachable integrity, unvarying good sense, and encyclopaedic knowledge of the law had made him the most generally respected figure in his camp. It was he who, in 1847, drafted for the “national opposition” its program of reform for the Diet of 1847. Ill health prevented him from seeking election to that body, but when, in March 1848, the crown sanctioned the establishment of an independent Hungarian ministry, the new minister president, Count Lajos Batthyány, insisted on his taking the portfolio of justice. As minister of justice, Deák was mainly responsible for the drafting of the reforming “April Laws” sanctioned by the monarch on April 11, 1848. During the next months, he took part in most of the negotiations between the Hungarian government and its opponents. He ceased to be minister when Batthyány resigned on September 28, and he refused reappointment, but in January 1849 he was a member of another mission that sought to intervene with Alfred, Fürst zu Windischgrätz, commander of the Austrian armies that had occupied Buda. Prevented from rejoining the Diet, he retired to his family estates, where he lived quietly for some years, unmolested by the Austrian authorities, who had decided that his activities had not been treasonable, but refusing all invitations to collaborate with a regime that he condemned as illegal.

Because Deák adamantly refused to recognize any regime that did not grant the legal validity of the April Laws, a Diet convoked in 1861 was dissolved and absolutist monarchy reimposed. As his international difficulties gradually convinced Emperor Francis Joseph of the need for reconciliation with Hungary, Deák, in both private conversations and public utterances, notably his famous “Easter Article” of April 16, 1865, put forward Hungary’s conditions in terms that presently led to the Compromise (Ausgleich) of 1867, by which the dual monarchy was established. Deák was beyond question the originator of the Compromise. The machinery that it embodied was not all of his devising, but it was his faith that a constitutionally satisfied Hungary and a strong monarchy could and must coexist that made the agreement possible; nor could agreement have been reached without his sagacity, resolution, and integrity and the faith that these qualities inspired in both camps. His adherents during the negotiations had styled themselves the “Deák Party.” He helped to complete the legislation deriving from the Compromise and defended it in Parliament when necessary. His health began to fail; his last public speech was made in November 1873. The Compromise was the crowning achievement of Deák’s life work, but there was hardly a field of public life in which he did not exercise his influence, and always on the side of humanity, reasoned reform, and good sense. He was a foremost fighter for the reform of the conditions of the Hungarian peasantry, setting the example on his own estates. Carlile Aylmer MacartneyThe Editors of Encyclopaedia Britannica",

Ferhat Abbas
Ferhat Abbas, in full Ferhat Mekki Abbas, (born
Aug. 24, 1899, Chahna, near Constantine, Alg.—died
Dec. 24, 1985, Algiers), politician and leader of the
national independence movement who served as the
first president of the Provisional Government of the
Algerian Republic.
Son of a Muslim official in the Algerian civil service, Abbas received an entirely French
education at Philippeville (now Skikda) and Constantine and at the University of Algiers.
After two years’ service with the French Army, he became a pharmacist at Sétif and was
elected first to the municipal council of Sétif and then to the general council in Constantine.
Early in his political career, he advocated collaboration with the French, the assimilation of
the “native element in French society,” and the abolition of colonialism to bring about the
emancipation of the Algerian Muslims as French citizens. Disillusioned by the French in
1938, he organized the Union Populaire Algérienne, which proposed equal rights for
French and Algerians while preserving the Algerian culture and language. Nevertheless, at
the outbreak of World War II, Abbas enlisted in the medical corps of the French Army.
On Feb. 10, 1943, the “Manifesto of the Algerian People,” prepared by Abbas, was
proclaimed. It was subsequently presented to the French and the Allied authorities in North
Africa. The manifesto, which reflected a fundamental change in its author’s political
position, not only condemned French colonial rule but also called for the application of the
principle of self-determination and demanded an Algerian constitution granting equality to
all inhabitants of Algeria. In May, Abbas, along with a number of his colleagues, wrote an
addendum to the manifesto, which envisioned a sovereign Algerian nation. It was presented
to the French on June 26. On its rejection by the French governor general, Ferhat Abbas
and an Algerian working-class leader, Messali Hadj, formed the Amis du Manifeste et de la
Liberté (AML; Friends of the Manifesto and Liberty), which envisioned an Algerian
autonomous republic federated to a renewed, anti-colonial France. After the suppression of
the AML and a year’s imprisonment, in 1946 he founded the Union Démocratique du
Manifeste Algérien (UDMA; Democratic Union of the Algerian Manifesto), which
advocated cooperation with France in the formation of the Algerian state. Abbas’ moderate
and conciliatory attempts failed to evoke a sympathetic response from the French colonial
officials, however, and in 1956 he escaped to Cairo to join the Front de Libération

Nationale (FLN), an Algerian organization committed to revolutionary struggle for
independence from France.
On Sept. 18, 1958, the Provisional Government of the Algerian Republic was formed with
Ferhat Abbas as president. He resigned in 1961 but was elected president of the Algerian
Constituent Assembly in 1962, when Algeria gained independence. Despite his political
alliance with the revolutionary and Socialist FLN, he remained an exponent of
parliamentary institutions and constitutionalism. To protest the drafting of the Algerian
constitution by the FLN outside the Constituent Assembly, he resigned his post as the
assembly’s president in August 1963 and was expelled from the FLN. An opponent of the
then-president, Ahmed Ben Bella, he was placed under house arrest in 1964 but was
released the following year.
Ferhat Abbas described the Algerian War of Independence in La Nuit coloniale (1962; “The
Colonial Night”). He is also the author of Le Jeune Algérien: de la colonie vers la province
(1931; “The Young Algerian: From Colony to Province”) and Autopsie d’une guerre (1980;
“Autopsy of a War”).

Filips van Montmorency, count van Horne
Filips van Montmorency, count van Horne, Dutch in full Filips van Montmorency,
graaf van Horne, Horne also spelled Hoorne, (born 1524?, Nevele, Flanders [now in
Belgium]—died June 5, 1568, Brussels), stadtholder of Gelderland and Zutphen, admiral of
the Netherlands, and member of the council of state of the Netherlands (1561–65), who
sought to preserve the traditional rights and privileges of the Netherlands and to end the
Spanish Inquisition.
A gentleman-in-waiting at the court of the Holy Roman emperor Charles V, Horne led
imperial troops in the Schmalkaldic War (1546–47) and commanded the bodyguard of the
future Spanish king Philip II (1550). He was appointed stadtholder of Gelderland and
Zutphen (September 1555), was invested as a knight of the Golden Fleece (1556), and
served as an admiral of the Spanish fleet (1559).
A member of the regent’s council of state (1561–65), Horne joined William I the Silent,
prince of Orange, and Lamoraal, count van Egmond, in opposing the repressive religious
and political policies of the leader of the council, Antoine de Granvelle, cardinal
archbishop of Mechelen, and successfully forced Philip II to order Granvelle’s retirement
(1564). The king’s continued persecution of the Protestants resulted in the formation of the
Compromise, or League of Nobles, a group of 400 lesser nobles who petitioned for an end
to the Inquisition, the tribunal established to discover and punish heresy. This league was
largely responsible for the anti-Roman Catholic uprisings in 1566–67 and further
government repressions after the king denied even the regent’s request for religious
toleration.
Although Horne had aligned himself with the Calvinists at Tournai in 1566, he obeyed the
regent’s order to return to Brussels (October 1566). At a meeting (December 1566) with
Orange and Egmond, Horne, like Egmond, refused to support the prince of Orange’s plan
for armed resistance against the king; Horne then retired to his home in Weert, the
Netherlands, where he remained in seclusion.
Lured to Brussels by expressions of reconciliation by the duke of Alba, who had arrived in
August 1567 to assume control of the government, Horne, along with Lamoraal, was
imprisoned (Sept. 9, 1567) by Alba, was convicted of treason and heresy by the Council of
Troubles (Council of Blood; the court established by Alba to prosecute rebels and heretics),
and, together with Egmond, was executed.

Francesco Crispi
Francesco Crispi, (born Oct. 4, 1819, Ribera, Sicily [Italy]—died Aug. 12, 1901, Naples),
Italian statesman who, after being exiled from Naples and Sardinia-Piedmont for
revolutionary activities, eventually became premier of a united Italy.
Crispi grew up in Sicily, where he studied law; but, disillusioned by conditions there, he
went to Naples, where he became active in republican agitation. He helped plan the
successful 1848 uprising in Sicily and became one of the deputies in the new government
before the island was regained by the Bourbon King Ferdinand II in 1849.
Crispi fled to Turin, where he became a journalist. Suspected of complicity in an uprising
in Milan in 1853, he was exiled and made his way to London, where he met Giuseppe
Mazzini, the leader of the republican movement in Italy. Crispi and the republicans hoped
eventually to unify Italy by beginning a revolution in Sicily, and in 1859 Crispi twice
traveled to Sicily, using forged passports, to organize another uprising. After much delay he
persuaded Giuseppe Garibaldi to invade Sicily in May 1860 with his band of volunteers,
known as “the Thousand,” to assist the popular uprising there. Quickly conquering the
whole island, Garibaldi proclaimed himself dictator and named Crispi minister of the
interior.
In that powerful position Crispi came into conflict with Count Cavour, premier of Sardinia-
Piedmont, who wanted to annex Sicily and Naples, which also had been conquered by
Garibaldi. After Crispi’s forced resignation, Sicily and Naples were annexed to the newly
created Kingdom of Italy (October 1860).
Elected deputy from Sicily in the new government (1861), Crispi, a temperamental,
uncompromising man lacking diplomatic finesse, made many political enemies. He broke
with his former ally Mazzini when he decided that unity, even under a monarch, was more
important than the establishment of a republic (1865). Because of his past he was
nevertheless suspected by the monarchists.
When the leftists came to power Crispi was elected president of the chamber (1876). After
a visit to the foreign heads of state in 1877 he began to advocate that Italy should ally with
Germany. Invited to be minister of the interior in the cabinet of Agostino Depretis
(December 1877), he was within a few months forced to resign over a charge of bigamy.

When Depretis died Crispi formed his first cabinet (August 1887), which was characterized
by liberal reform and economic crisis. Holding the positions of minister of the interior and
minister of foreign affairs, as well as that of premier, he was accused of dictatorial
tendencies. His foreign policy, moreover, was extremely unpopular, both because he
renewed the alliance of 1882 with Austria-Hungary and Germany and because he broke off
trade with France (1889), causing great economic hardship. A large budgetary deficit,
necessitating increased taxes, toppled his government in 1891.
Nevertheless, in December 1893 Crispi again became premier. While he greatly improved
the economic situation, he became increasingly repressive, brutally crushing a socialist
uprising in Sicily. He also embarked upon a disastrous foreign policy. He organized Italy’s
few possessions on the Red Sea into Eritrea, and then he tried to turn Italy into a colonial
power in Africa. The disastrous Italian defeat at the Battle of Adwa in 1896 at the hands of
Emperor Menilek II of Ethiopia earned Crispi a vote of censure that caused him to resign in
March of the same year.

Crispi grew up in Sicily, where he studied law; but, disillusioned by conditions there, he went to Naples, where he became active in republican agitation. He helped plan the successful 1848 uprising in Sicily and became one of the deputies in the new government before the island was regained by the Bourbon King Ferdinand II in 1849. Crispi fled to Turin, where he became a journalist. Suspected of complicity in an uprising in Milan in 1853, he was exiled and made his way to London, where he met Giuseppe Mazzini, the leader of the republican movement in Italy. Crispi and the republicans hoped eventually to unify Italy by beginning a revolution in Sicily, and in 1859 Crispi twice traveled to Sicily, using forged passports, to organize another uprising. After much delay he persuaded Giuseppe Garibaldi to invade Sicily in May 1860 with his band of volunteers, known as “the Thousand,” to assist the popular uprising there. Quickly conquering the whole island, Garibaldi proclaimed himself dictator and named Crispi minister of the interior. In that powerful position Crispi came into conflict with Count Cavour, premier of Sardinia- Piedmont, who wanted to annex Sicily and Naples, which also had been conquered by Garibaldi. After Crispi’s forced resignation, Sicily and Naples were annexed to the newly created Kingdom of Italy (October 1860). Elected deputy from Sicily in the new government (1861), Crispi, a temperamental, uncompromising man lacking diplomatic finesse, made many political enemies. He broke with his former ally Mazzini when he decided that unity, even under a monarch, was more important than the establishment of a republic (1865). Because of his past he was nevertheless suspected by the monarchists. When the leftists came to power Crispi was elected president of the chamber (1876). After a visit to the foreign heads of state in 1877 he began to advocate that Italy should ally with Germany. Invited to be minister of the interior in the cabinet of Agostino Depretis (December 1877), he was within a few months forced to resign over a charge of bigamy. Francesco Crispi   When Depretis died Crispi formed his first cabinet (August 1887), which was characterized by liberal reform and economic crisis. Holding the positions of minister of the interior and minister of foreign affairs, as well as that of premier, he was accused of dictatorial tendencies. His foreign policy, moreover, was extremely unpopular, both because he renewed the alliance of 1882 with Austria-Hungary and Germany and because he broke off trade with France (1889), causing great economic hardship. A large budgetary deficit, necessitating increased taxes, toppled his government in 1891. Nevertheless, in December 1893 Crispi again became premier. While he greatly improved the economic situation, he became increasingly repressive, brutally crushing a socialist uprising in Sicily. He also embarked upon a disastrous foreign policy. He organized Italy’s few possessions on the Red Sea into Eritrea, and then he tried to turn Italy into a colonial power in Africa. The disastrous Italian defeat at the Battle of Adwa in 1896 at the hands of Emperor Menilek II of Ethiopia earned Crispi a vote of censure that caused him to resign in March of the same year.",

Francis Hopkinson
Francis Hopkinson, (born October 2, 1737, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania [U.S.]—died May
9, 1791, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, U.S.), American lawyer, musician, author, member of
the Continental Congress, and signer of the Declaration of Independence.
Hopkinson was educated at the College of Philadelphia (later the University of
Pennsylvania), graduating in 1757, and also studied law. After a brief business career, he
launched a successful legal practice in New Jersey, being admitted to the bar in 1761.
During the 1760s he was secretary of a commission that finalized a treaty between Native
Americans and Pennsylvania, and he served as a customs collector in Salem, New Jersey,
and New Castle, Delaware.
In 1774 Hopkinson, who had restarted his law practice in Bordentown, N.J., was appointed
to the governor’s council, and in 1776 he represented New Jersey in the Continental
Congress. He signed the Declaration of Independence and later served in several minor
offices in the new American government. From 1779 to 1789 he was judge of the admiralty
court for Pennsylvania, and from 1789 to his death he was U.S. district judge for eastern
Pennsylvania. An ardent backer of the Constitution, he was a member of the convention
that approved it and wrote several effective articles that contributed to the ratification effort
in Pennsylvania. From 1789–91 he served as U.S. district court judge in Pennsylvania.
Hopkinson was an accomplished player of the harpsichord and a composer of both
religious and secular songs. In addition, he wrote poetry and literary essays. During the
Revolution, he ridiculed the British and their loyalist sympathizers with pointed political
satires. After the Revolution, he maintained a steady correspondence with Benjamin
Franklin, George Washington, and Thomas Jefferson.
Among his varied pursuits, Hopkinson was also an artist. He designed the seal of the
American Philosophical Society, the seal for the state of New Jersey, and seals for various
departments of the U.S. government. There is strong evidence to support the view that he
helped design the American flag; the U.S. Congress, however, turned down his petition for
payment, asserting that others had also contributed to the design.

Francis II
Francis II, (born June 23, 1435—died Sept. 9, 1488,
Couëron, Brittany), duke of Brittany from 1458, who
succeeded his uncle, Arthur III; he maintained a
lifelong policy of Breton independence in the face of
encroachments by the French crown. The problems of
Breton independence were magnified by the fact that
Francis had no sons; the fate of his Breton lands would depend on the terms of the
marriages he secured for his daughters.
Francis joined the League of the Public Weal against King Louis XI of France in 1465,
invaded Normandy in 1467 on behalf of the dispossessed Charles de France (Louis XI’s
brother), and allied himself with King Edward IV of England in 1468. Forced to sign the
Treaty of Ancenis with France (1468), he allied himself again with Edward in 1475, but
once more had to come to terms with France. When Louis XI bought the House of
Penthièvre’s rights to the duchy of Brittany (1480), Francis in 1481 made yet another treaty
with Edward, whereby his eldest daughter, Anne (later queen consort of France), was to
marry the Prince of Wales.
When Francis’ chief counsellor, Pierre Landais, provoked the hatred of the Breton nobles
by his persecution of the chancellor Guillaume Chauvin, the nobles, with the support of
Anne of Beaujeu, regent of France, had Landais hanged (1485). When Anne sent French
troops into Brittany, however, the nobles rallied to the Duke’s side. Defeated in 1488,
Francis was forced to sign the Treaty of Le Verger, in which he undertook to contract
marriages for his daughters Anne and Isabelle only with the French king’s permission,
thereby relieving France of the danger that Brittany might fall to some foreign power.

Miranda, Francisco de
Francisco de Miranda
Francisco de Miranda, (born March 28, 1750,
Caracas, Venez.—died July 14, 1816, Cádiz, Spain),
Venezuelan revolutionary who helped to pave the way
for independence in Latin America. His own plan for
the liberation of Spain’s American colonies with the
help of the European powers failed, but he remains
known as El Precursor—i.e., “the forerunner” of
Bolívar and other more effective revolutionaries.
Educated in Caracas, Miranda purchased a captaincy in the Spanish army at the age of 22.
He was imprisoned for disobedience but was released in 1780 and sent to Cuba to fight
against Great Britain. There he was accused of misuse of funds. Protesting his innocence,
he fled to the United States in 1783.
There he met many of the leaders of the American Revolution and formed his plans for the
liberation of South and Central America from Spanish domination. Hounded by Spanish
agents, he fled to London, where he tried to enlist the aid of Prime Minister William Pitt in
his plan of revolution. Pitt, realizing that Spain would eventually lose its grip on its
American colonies, thought that Miranda was useful for Britain’s purposes and provided
him with limited support and protection. Miranda envisioned an independent empire,
stretching from the Mississippi to Cape Horn, under the leadership of a hereditary emperor
from the Incan royal family and with a legislature of two houses.
The French Revolution delayed Miranda’s plans for a few years. He served as a French
Revolutionary general and was jailed for suspected treason and then acquitted. Returning
once again to London, he became the leader of all the exiled plotters against Spain. With
volunteers gathered from the United States, he embarked on an invasion of Venezuela in
1806, but he was forced to turn back when Venezuelans failed to rally to his side. In 1810
he met Simón Bolívar, who was in London attempting to get British support for the
revolution that had finally begun in South America. Bolívar persuaded Miranda to return to
Venezuela, where he was made a general in the revolutionary army. When the country
formally declared independence on July 5, 1811, he assumed dictatorial powers.
The Spanish forces counterattacked, and Miranda, fearing a brutal and hopeless defeat,
signed an armistice with them in July 1812 at San Mateo. The other revolutionary leaders,

to escape; they allowed him to be handed over to the Spanish. Transported in chains to

Francisco de Paula Santander
Francisco de Paula Santander
Francisco de Paula Santander, (born April 2, 1792,
Rosario, New Granada [now Colombia]—died May
6, 1840, Bogotá), soldier and statesman who fought
beside Simón Bolívar in the war for South American
independence and who served as president of the
newly formed New Granada (Colombia) from 1833
until 1837.
Santander left law school in 1810 to join the patriot army and was promoted rapidly. He
escaped the Spanish reconquest of 1816 by fleeing to the eastern lowlands and returned in
1819 as brigadier general in Bolívar’s invading force. Santander remained as vice president
of New Granada in the Republic of Colombia, or Gran Colombia (which also included
Venezuela and Ecuador). During much of the time before 1827, he served as acting
president in Bolívar’s absences. Santander proved to be an able statesman, known for his
democratic republican principles and efficient procedures. Santander and Bolívar began to
clash over political differences soon after New Granada’s independence; a climax was
reached in 1826, when Bolívar decided to retain Venezuela in Colombia, a decision of
which Santander disapproved.
In 1828 conspirators attacked Bolívar’s palace at San Carlos; he escaped through a window
as the intruders entered. Santander was believed to be connected with the plot and was
sentenced to death, though it is now thought that he tried to discourage the conspirators.
Nothing was proved, and his sentence was therefore commuted to banishment.
After Gran Colombia was dissolved in 1830 and a new constitution was promulgated in
1832, Santander was called back to become president of New Granada on April 1, 1833;
his administration was noted for its economy, firmness, and orderliness. His intolerance of
Bolívaristas, however, caused some disturbance, and an unsuccessful plot to overthrow him
was led by General José Sarda. His presidency ended in 1837, after which he served as
senator for New Granada. His death was followed by a two-year civil conflict of major
proportions.

Franjo Tudjman
Franjo Tudjman, (born May 14, 1922, Veliko Trgovisce, Kingdom of Serbs, Croats, and
Slovenes [now Croatia]—died December 10, 1999, Zagreb, Croatia), Croat politician who
led the country to independence from Yugoslavia in 1991 and who was president until his
death.
Having joined the Partisans in 1941, Tudjman launched a military career in the Yugoslav
army, rose quickly in rank, and in 1960 became one of its youngest generals. The following
year he left military service and became the director of the Institute for the History of the
Workers’ Movement. He received a doctorate in history from the University of Zagreb’s
faculty of arts in Zadar (now the University of Zadar) in 1965.
Tudjman was outspoken on nationalist issues, including the charge that Yugoslav
authorities had inflated the crimes committed by Croatian Nazis (Ustaša) during World War
II. His criticism of the government led to his expulsion from the Communist Party in 1967
and dismissal from his job, and twice, in 1972 and in 1981, he was sentenced to prison
terms for antigovernment activities.
In 1989 Tudjman founded the Croatian Democratic
Union (HDZ), which won Croatia’s first free
parliamentary elections in 1990. Named president, he
pressed for the creation of a homogenous Croat state.
When Serb areas of Eastern and Western Slavonia
and the Krajina revolted, they were occupied by the
Yugoslav army. Beginning in 1995, Tudjman
reasserted control over these areas and established virtual control over portions of Bosnia
and Herzegovina with majority Croat populations. Although he signed the 1995 Dayton
Peace Agreement on Bosnia, his authoritarian style, along with his refusal to cooperate
with the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia, led to the international
isolation of Croatia.

François Bonivard
François Bonivard, (born 1493, Seyssel, Savoy [France]—died 1570, Geneva
[Switzerland]), Genevan patriot, the hero of Lord Byron’s poem “The Prisoner of Chillon.”
Bonivard’s real character and history are very different from the legendary account that
Byron popularized. After succeeding his uncle as head of the Cluniac priory of St. Victor,
near Geneva, he began to oppose the encroachments made by Charles III, duke of Savoy,
and the bishop of Geneva against that city’s liberties. He was imprisoned by the duke at
Grolée from 1519 to 1521, lost his priory, and became more and more anti-Savoyard. In
1528, supported by the city of Geneva, he took up arms against those who had seized his
ecclesiastical revenues; in 1530, however, he was imprisoned in the castle of Chillon,
where he was kept underground from 1532 until he was released in 1536.
Becoming a Protestant, Bonivard obtained a pension from Geneva and was married four
times. In 1542 he began compiling his Chroniques de Genève, a history of Geneva from the
earliest times. His manuscript was submitted to the reformer John Calvin for correction in
1551, but it was not published until 1831. He also wrote De l’ancienne et nouvelle police
de Genève (1555; “The Old and New Government of Geneva”).

Frédéric-César de La Harpe
Frédéric-César de La Harpe, (born April 6, 1754, Rolle, Vaud, Switz.—died March 30,
1838, Lausanne), Swiss political leader and Vaudois patriot, tutor and confidant to Tsar
Alexander I of Russia and a central figure in the creation of the Helvetic Republic (1798).
Resentment of Bernese administration in his native Vaud caused La Harpe to go abroad,
and at the Russian imperial court he found employment as tutor to the future tsar Alexander
and his brother Constantine (1784). Following the outbreak of the French Revolution, he
began to plot a Vaudois uprising from St. Petersburg. In 1794 he returned to Switzerland
and thence to Paris, where he sought French assistance for releasing the Vaud from Bern’s
domination. In 1797 La Harpe published his Essai sur la constitution du pays de Vaud
(“Essay on the Constitution of the Vaud”), an anti-Bernese tract, and on Dec. 9, 1797, on
behalf of a group of refugees from the Vaud and Fribourg, he addressed a petition to the
French Directory urging military intervention in Switzerland to secure Vaudois
independence, thus providing the official pretext for the subsequent French invasion
(March 1798). With Peter Ochs he succeeded in creating a unitary government for
Switzerland, and on June 29, 1798, he entered the Directory (chief executive organ) of the
new Helvetic Republic. After securing the deposition of Ochs (June 1799), La Harpe
sought dictatorial power but was himself deposed in the coup of Jan. 7, 1800. Later,
accused of conspiracy against the state and anti-French intrigue, he was forced to flee the
country. With the fall of Napoleon, he secured from his protector and erstwhile pupil, Tsar
Alexander I, a formal promise of Vaudois independence (1814) and made representations
on behalf of Switzerland and his native canton at the Congress of Vienna (1815). Returning
to the Vaud the following year, he served on its legislative council until 1828.

Félix Houphouët-Boigny
Félix Houphouët-Boigny, (born Oct. 18, 1905?,
Yamoussoukro, Côte d’Ivoire, French West Africa—died
Dec. 7, 1993, Yamoussoukro, Côte d’Ivoire), politician
and physician who was president of Côte d’Ivoire (Ivory
Coast) from independence in 1960 until his death in 1993.
Under his rule it became one of the most prosperous
nations in sub-Saharan Africa.
The son of a wealthy Baule chief, Houphouët-Boigny worked as a rural doctor and pursued
a second career as a wealthy planter. He began his political career as a cofounder of the
African Agricultural Syndicate, formed by disgruntled African planters (1944) to protect
their interests against European settlers. In the first Côte d’Ivoire elections (1945) he was
elected a deputy to the French National Assembly and was easily reelected in 1946. That
year he also founded the Democratic Party of Côte d’Ivoire (PDCI); this party was
affiliated with the French Communist Party and was an important component of the
interterritorial French West African Federation party, the African Democratic Rally, of
which he was also president.
In the late 1940s the French administration became increasingly hostile to the PDCI,
especially after the Communist Party went into opposition in France, and in October 1950
Houphouët-Boigny decided to break his party’s ties with the Communists and to cooperate
with the French, all the time building up his party’s strength and organization through
successive elections. In the period from 1956 to 1960 he divided his time between France,
where he was a member of the National Assembly and a cabinet minister, and Côte
d’Ivoire, where he was president of the territorial assembly and mayor of Abidjan as well
as overall party leader. Meanwhile, he strongly rejected the idea of a West African
federation of independent states because he was unwilling to have the wealthy Côte
d’Ivoire subsidizing its poorer neighbours. When President Charles de Gaulle in 1958
offered French territories a referendum on whether to join a new federal community or to
become independent, Houphouët-Boigny campaigned successfully for self-government
within the French Community.
Houphouët-Boigny became prime minister of the Côte d’Ivoire government in 1959 and
was elected the first president of the independent country in 1960. He was reelected to the
presidency unopposed in 1965, 1970, 1975, 1980, and 1985. A skillful and pragmatic

politician, he won over opponents to his one-party rule through cooperation, consensus,
and compromise.
From the start Houphouët-Boigny pursued liberal free-enterprise policies and developed
Côte d’Ivoire’s cash-crop agriculture at a time when many other African nations were
pursuing costly and abortive attempts at state-run industrialization. Under his leadership the
country became a major exporter of cocoa, coffee, pineapples, and palm oil. Houphouët-
Boigny welcomed foreign investment and cooperated closely with France in economic
matters, even going so far as to employ thousands of French technical and managerial
personnel to ensure his country’s development. By the early 1980s Côte d’Ivoire had one of
the highest per capita incomes of any sub-Saharan African nation without petroleum
exports. In 1990 Houphouët-Boigny was reelected in Côte d’Ivoire’s first contested
presidential elections.

In the late 1940s the French administration became increasingly hostile to the PDCI, especially after the Communist Party went into opposition in France, and in October 1950 Houphouët-Boigny decided to break his party’s ties with the Communists and to cooperate with the French, all the time building up his party’s strength and organization through successive elections. In the period from 1956 to 1960 he divided his time between France, where he was a member of the National Assembly and a cabinet minister, and Côte d’Ivoire, where he was president of the territorial assembly and mayor of Abidjan as well as overall party leader. Meanwhile, he strongly rejected the idea of a West African federation of independent states because he was unwilling to have the wealthy Côte d’Ivoire subsidizing its poorer neighbours. When President Charles de Gaulle in 1958 offered French territories a referendum on whether to join a new federal community or to become independent, Houphouët-Boigny campaigned successfully for self-government within the French Community. Houphouët-Boigny became prime minister of the Côte d’Ivoire government in 1959 and was elected the first president of the independent country in 1960. He was reelected to the presidency unopposed in 1965, 1970, 1975, 1980, and 1985. A skillful and pragmatic  Félix Houphouët-Boigny   politician, he won over opponents to his one-party rule through cooperation, consensus, and compromise. From the start Houphouët-Boigny pursued liberal free-enterprise policies and developed Côte d’Ivoire’s cash-crop agriculture at a time when many other African nations were pursuing costly and abortive attempts at state-run industrialization. Under his leadership the country became a major exporter of cocoa, coffee, pineapples, and palm oil. Houphouët- Boigny welcomed foreign investment and cooperated closely with France in economic matters, even going so far as to employ thousands of French technical and managerial personnel to ensure his country’s development. By the early 1980s Côte d’Ivoire had one of the highest per capita incomes of any sub-Saharan African nation without petroleum exports. In 1990 Houphouët-Boigny was reelected in Côte d’Ivoire’s first contested presidential elections. This article was most recently revised and updated by Amy McKenna.",

Gaston Eyskens
Gaston Eyskens, (born April 1, 1905, Lier, Belg.—died Jan. 3, 1988, Leuven [Louvain]),
economist and statesman who as Belgian premier (1949–50, 1958–61, and 1968–72)
settled crises concerning aid to parochial schools and the accelerating independence
movement in the Belgian Congo (now Congo [Kinshasa]).
A professor of economics at the Catholic University of Leuven (Louvain) from 1934,
Eyskens entered the Belgian Parliament in 1939 as a member of the Catholic (now Social
Christian) Party. He served as minister of finance (1945, 1947–49) and as premier of a
Social Christian–Liberal coalition government (1949–50). He resigned during the
controversy over the exiled King Leopold III’s proposed return, when anti-Leopold
Liberals withdrew from the Cabinet.
Chosen in 1958 to head another coalition government, Eyskens settled a long-standing
dispute by enacting the Schools Pact, which granted equal financial aid to public and
parochial schools. In 1960, realizing that Belgium could no longer handle the political and
economic problems of the Belgian Congo, he persuaded Parliament to grant independence
to that colony. Belgium’s internal economic problems, as well as the bloody civil war that
followed the Congo’s independence, toppled his government in the March 1961 election.
After again serving as minister of finance (1965–66), he began a third term as premier in
June 1968. Unable to put into effect a paragraph in the new Belgian constitution that
provided for regionalization of the country, he resigned in November 1972. From 1973 to
1980 he was chairman of the board of the Kredietbank NV in Brussels.

George Washington
George Washington
George Washington, also called Father of His
Country, (born February 22 [February 11, Old Style],
1732, Westmoreland county, Virginia [U.S.]—died
December 14, 1799, Mount Vernon, Virginia, U.S.),
American general and commander in chief of the
colonial armies in the American Revolution (1775–
83) and subsequently first president of the United
States (1789–97).
Washington’s father, Augustine Washington, had gone
to school in England, tasted seafaring life, and then
settled down to manage his growing Virginia estates.
His mother was Mary Ball, whom Augustine, a
widower, had married early the previous year.
Washington’s paternal lineage had some distinction; an early forebear was described as a
“gentleman,” Henry VIII later gave the family lands, and its members held various offices.
But family fortunes fell with the Puritan revolution in England, and John Washington,
grandfather of Augustine, migrated in 1657 to Virginia. The ancestral home at Sulgrave,
Northamptonshire, is maintained as a Washington memorial. Little definite information
exists on any of the line until Augustine. He was an energetic, ambitious man who acquired
much land, built mills, took an interest in opening iron mines, and sent his two eldest sons
to England for schooling. By his first wife, Jane Butler, he had four children. By his second
wife, Mary Ball, he had six. Augustine died April 12, 1743.
Childhood and youth
Little is known of George Washington’s early
childhood, spent largely on the Ferry Farm on the
Rappahannock River, opposite Fredericksburg,
Virginia. Mason L. Weems’s stories of the hatchet and
cherry tree and of young Washington’s repugnance to
fighting are apocryphal efforts to fill a manifest gap.
He attended school irregularly from his 7th to his
15th year, first with the local church sexton and later
with a schoolmaster named Williams. Some of his

schoolboy papers survive. He was fairly well trained
in practical mathematics—gauging, several types of
mensuration, and such trigonometry as was useful in
surveying. He studied geography, possibly had a little
Latin, and certainly read some of The Spectator and
other English classics. The copybook in which he
transcribed at 14 a set of moral precepts, or Rules of
Civility and Decent Behaviour in Company and Conversation, was carefully preserved. His
best training, however, was given him by practical men and outdoor occupations, not by
books. He mastered tobacco growing and stock raising, and early in his teens he was
sufficiently familiar with surveying to plot the fields about him.
At his father’s death, the 11-year-old boy became the ward of his half brother Lawrence, a
man of fine character who gave him wise and affectionate care. Lawrence inherited the
beautiful estate of Little Hunting Creek, which had been granted to the original settler, John
Washington, and which Augustine had done much since 1738 to develop. Lawrence
married Anne (Nancy) Fairfax, daughter of Col. William Fairfax, a cousin and agent of
Lord Fairfax and one of the chief proprietors of the region. Lawrence also built a house and
named the 2,500-acre (1,000-hectare) holding Mount Vernon in honour of the admiral
under whom he had served in the siege of Cartagena. Living there chiefly with Lawrence
(though he spent some time near Fredericksburg with his other half brother, Augustine,
called Austin), George entered a more spacious and polite world. Anne Fairfax Washington
was a woman of charm, grace, and culture; Lawrence had brought from his English school
and naval service much knowledge and experience. A valued neighbour and relative,
George William Fairfax, whose large estate, Belvoir, was about 4 miles (6 km) distant, and
other relatives by marriage, the Carlyles of Alexandria, helped form George’s mind and
manners.
The youth turned first to surveying as a profession. Lord Fairfax, a middle-aged bachelor
who owned more than 5,000,000 acres (2,000,000 hectares) in northern Virginia and the
Shenandoah Valley, came to America in 1746 to live with his cousin George William at
Belvoir and to look after his properties. Two years later he sent to the Shenandoah Valley a
party to survey and plot his lands to make regular tenants of the squatters moving in from
Pennsylvania. With the official surveyor of Prince William county in charge, Washington
went along as assistant. The 16-year-old lad kept a disjointed diary of the trip, which shows
skill in observation. He describes the discomfort of sleeping under “one thread Bear
blanket with double its Weight of Vermin such as Lice Fleas & c”; an encounter with an

Indian war party bearing a scalp; the Pennsylvania-German emigrants, “as ignorant a set of
people as the Indians they would never speak English but when spoken to they speak all
Dutch”; and the serving of roast wild turkey on “a Large Chip,” for “as for dishes we had
none.”
The following year (1749), aided by Lord Fairfax, Washington received an appointment as
official surveyor of Culpeper county, and for more than two years he was kept almost
constantly busy. Surveying not only in Culpeper but also in Frederick and Augusta
counties, he made journeys far beyond the Tidewater region into the western wilderness.
The experience taught him resourcefulness and endurance and toughened him in both body
and mind. Coupled with Lawrence’s ventures in land, it also gave him an interest in
western development that endured throughout his life. He was always disposed to speculate
in western holdings and to view favourably projects for colonizing the West, and he greatly
resented the limitations that the crown in time laid on the westward movement. In 1752
Lord Fairfax determined to take up his final residence in the Shenandoah Valley and settled
there in a log hunting lodge, which he called Greenway Court after a Kentish manor of his
family’s. There Washington was sometimes entertained and had access to a small library
that Fairfax had begun accumulating at Oxford.
The years 1751–52 marked a turning point in
Washington’s life, for they placed him in control of
Mount Vernon. Lawrence, stricken by tuberculosis,
went to Barbados in 1751 for his health, taking
George along. From this sole journey beyond the
present borders of the United States, Washington
returned with the light scars of an attack of smallpox.
In July of the next year, Lawrence died, making George executor and residuary heir of his
estate should his daughter, Sarah, die without issue. As she died within two months,
Washington at age 20 became head of one of the best Virginia estates. He always thought
farming the “most delectable” of pursuits. “It is honorable,” he wrote, “it is amusing, and,
with superior judgment, it is profitable.” And, of all the spots for farming, he thought
Mount Vernon the best. “No estate in United America,” he assured an English
correspondent, “is more pleasantly situated than this.” His greatest pride in later days was
to be regarded as the first farmer of the land.
He gradually increased the estate until it exceeded 8,000 acres (3,000 hectares). He
enlarged the house in 1760 and made further enlargements and improvements on the house

The Farmer, George Washington
and its landscaping in 1784–86. He also tried to keep abreast of the latest scientific
advances.
For the next 20 years the main background of
Washington’s life was the work and society of Mount
Vernon. He gave assiduous attention to the rotation of
crops, fertilization of the soil, and the management of
livestock. He had to manage the 18 slaves that came
with the estate and others he bought later; by 1760 he
had paid taxes on 49 slaves—though he strongly
disapproved of the institution and hoped for some mode of abolishing it. At the time of his
death, more than 300 slaves were housed in the quarters on his property. He had been
unwilling to sell slaves lest families be broken up, even though the increase in their
numbers placed a burden on him for their upkeep and gave him a larger force of workers
than he required, especially after he gave up the cultivation of tobacco. In his will, he
bequeathed the slaves in his possession to his wife and ordered that upon her death they be
set free, declaring also that the young, the aged, and the infirm among them “shall be
comfortably cloathed & fed by my heirs.” Still, this accounted for only about half the
slaves on his property. The other half, owned by his wife, were entailed to the Custis estate,
so that on her death they were destined to pass to her heirs. However, she freed all the
slaves in 1800 after his death.
For diversion Washington was fond of riding, fox hunting, and dancing, of such theatrical
performances as he could reach, and of duck hunting and sturgeon fishing. He liked
billiards and cards and not only subscribed to racing associations but also ran his own
horses in races. In all outdoor pursuits, from wrestling to colt breaking, he excelled. A
friend of the 1750s describes him as “straight as an Indian, measuring six feet two inches in
his stockings”; as very muscular and broad-shouldered but, though large-boned, weighing
only 175 pounds; and as having long arms and legs. His penetrating blue-gray eyes were
overhung by heavy brows, his nose was large and straight, and his mouth was large and
firmly closed. “His movements and gestures are graceful, his walk majestic, and he is a
splendid horseman.” He soon became prominent in community affairs, was an active
member and later vestryman of the Episcopal church, and as early as 1755 expressed a
desire to stand for the Virginia House of Burgesses.

Traditions of John Washington’s feats as Indian fighter and Lawrence Washington’s talk of
service days helped imbue George with military ambition. Just after Lawrence’s death,
Lieut. Gov. Robert Dinwiddie appointed George adjutant for the southern district of
Virginia at £100 a year (November 1752). In 1753 he became adjutant of the Northern
Neck and Eastern Shore. Later that year, Dinwiddie found it necessary to warn the French
to desist from their encroachments on Ohio Valley lands claimed by the crown. After
sending one messenger who failed to reach the goal, he determined to dispatch Washington.
On the day he received his orders, October 31, 1753, Washington set out for the French
posts. His party consisted of a Dutchman to serve as interpreter, the expert scout
Christopher Gist as guide, and four others, two of them experienced traders with the
Indians. Theoretically, Great Britain and France were at peace. Actually, war impended,
and Dinwiddie’s message was an ultimatum: the French must get out or be put out.
The journey proved rough, perilous, and futile.
Washington’s party left what is now Cumberland,
Maryland, in the middle of November and, despite
wintry weather and impediments of the wilderness,
reached Fort LeBoeuf, at what is now Waterford,
Pennsylvania, 20 miles (32 km) south of Lake Erie,
without delay. The French commander was courteous
but adamant. As Washington reported, his officers “told me, That it was their absolute
Design to take possession of the Ohio, and by God they would do it.” Eager to carry this
alarming news back, Washington pushed off hurriedly with Gist. He was lucky to have
gotten back alive. An Indian fired at them at 15 paces but missed. When they crossed the
Allegheny River on a raft, Washington was jerked into the ice-filled stream but saved
himself by catching one of the timbers. That night he almost froze in his wet clothing. He
reached Williamsburg, Virginia, on January 16, 1754, where he hastily penned a record of
the journey. Dinwiddie, who was labouring to convince the crown of the seriousness of the
French threat, had it printed, and when he sent it to London, it was reprinted in three
different forms.
The enterprising governor forthwith planned an expedition to hold the Ohio country. He
made Joshua Fry colonel of a provincial regiment, appointed Washington lieutenant
colonel, and set them to recruiting troops. Two agents of the Ohio Company, which
Lawrence Washington and others had formed to develop lands on the upper Potomac and
Ohio rivers, had begun building a fort at what later became Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.
Dinwiddie, ready to launch into his own war, sent Washington with two companies to

reinforce this post. In April 1754 the lieutenant colonel set out from Alexandria with about
160 men at his back. He marched to Cumberland only to learn that the French had
anticipated the British blow; they had taken possession of the fort of the Ohio Company
and had renamed it Fort Duquesne. Happily, the Indians of the area offered support.
Washington therefore struggled cautiously forward to within about 40 miles (60 km) of the
French position and erected his own post at Great Meadows, near what is now Confluence,
Pennsylvania. From this base, he made a surprise attack (May 28, 1754) upon an advance
detachment of 30 French, killing the commander, Coulon de Jumonville, and nine others
and taking the rest prisoners. The French and Indian War had begun.
Washington at once received promotion to a full colonelcy and was reinforced,
commanding a considerable body of Virginia and North Carolina troops, with Indian
auxiliaries. But his attack soon brought the whole French force down upon him. They
drove his 350 men into the Great Meadows fort (Fort Necessity) on July 3, besieged it with
700 men, and, after an all-day fight, compelled him to surrender. The construction of the
fort had been a blunder, for it lay in a waterlogged creek bottom, was commanded on three
sides by forested elevations approaching it closely, and was too far from Washington’s
supports. The French agreed to let the disarmed colonials march back to Virginia with the
honours of war, but they compelled Washington to promise that Virginia would not build
another fort on the Ohio for a year and to sign a paper acknowledging responsibility for
“l’assassinat” of de Jumonville, a word that Washington later explained he did not rightly
understand. He returned to Virginia, chagrined but proud, to receive the thanks of the
House of Burgesses and to find that his name had been mentioned in the London gazettes.
His remark in a letter to his brother that “I have heard the bullets whistle; and believe me,
there is something charming in the sound” was commented on humorously by the author
Horace Walpole and sarcastically by King George II.
The arrival of Gen. Edward Braddock and his army in Virginia in February 1755, as part of
the triple plan of campaign that called for his advance on Fort Duquesne and in New York
Gov. William Shirley’s capture of Fort Niagara and Sir William Johnson’s capture of
Crown Point, brought Washington new opportunities and responsibilities. He had resigned
his commission in October 1754 in resentment of the slighting treatment and underpayment
of colonial officers and particularly because of an untactful order of the British war office
that provincial officers of whatever rank would be subordinate to any officer holding the
king’s commission. But he ardently desired a part in the war; “my inclinations,” he wrote a
friend, “are strongly bent to arms.” When Braddock showed appreciation of his merits and
invited him to join the expedition as personal aide-de-camp, with the courtesy title of
1/14/23, 3:48 PM

https://www.britannica.com/print/article/636381

colonel, he therefore accepted. His self-reliance, decision, and masterfulness soon became
apparent.
At table he had frequent disputes with Braddock, who, when contractors failed to deliver
their supplies, attacked the colonials as supine and dishonest while Washington defended
them warmly. His freedom of utterance is proof of Braddock’s esteem. Braddock accepted
Washington’s unwise advice that he divide his army, leaving half of it to come up with the
slow wagons and cattle train and taking the other half forward against Fort Duquesne at a
rapid pace. Washington was ill with fever during June but joined the advance guard in a
covered wagon on July 8, begged to lead the march on Fort Duquesne with his Virginians
and Indian allies, and was by Braddock’s side when on July 9 the army was ambushed and
bloodily defeated.
In this defeat Washington displayed the combination of coolness and determination, the
alliance of unconquerable energy with complete poise, that was the secret of so many of his
successes. So ill that he had to use a pillow instead of a saddle and that Braddock ordered
his body servant to keep special watch over him, Washington was, nevertheless,
everywhere at once. At first he followed Braddock as the general bravely tried to rally his
men to push either forward or backward, the wisest course the circumstances permitted.
Then he rode back to bring up the Virginians from the rear and rallied them with effect on
the flank. To him was largely due the escape of the force. His exposure of his person was as
reckless as Braddock’s, who was fatally wounded on his fifth horse; Washington had two
horses shot out from under him and his clothes cut by four bullets without being hurt. He
was at Braddock’s deathbed, helped bring the troops back, and was repaid by being
appointed, in August 1755, while still only 23 years old, commander of all Virginia troops.
But no part of his later service was conspicuous. Finding that a Maryland captain who held
a royal commission would not obey him, he rode north in February 1756 to Boston to have
the question settled by the commander in chief in America, Governor Shirley, and, bearing
a letter from Dinwiddie, had no difficulty in carrying his point. On his return he plunged
into a multitude of vexations. He had to protect a weak, thinly settled frontier nearly 400
miles (650 km) in length with only some 700 ill-disciplined colonial troops, to cope with a
legislature unwilling to support him, to meet attacks on the drunkenness and inefficiency of
the soldiers, and to endure constant wilderness hardships. It is not strange that in 1757 his
health failed and in the closing weeks of that year he was so ill of a “bloody flux”
(dysentery) that his physician ordered him home to Mount Vernon.

George Washington: wedding
to Martha Dandridge Custis
George Washington: Mount
Vernon map
In the spring of 1758 he had recovered sufficiently to return to duty as colonel in command
of all Virginia troops. As part of the grand sweep of several armies organized by British
statesman William Pitt the Elder, Gen. John Forbes led a new advance upon Fort Duquesne.
Forbes resolved not to use Braddock’s road but to cut a new one west from Raystown,
Pennsylvania. Washington disapproved of the route but played an important part in the
movement. Late in the autumn the French evacuated and burned Fort Duquesne, and
Forbes reared Fort Pitt on the site. Washington, who had just been elected to the House of
Burgesses, was able to resign with the honorary rank of brigadier general.
Although his officers expressed regret at the “loss of such an excellent Commander, such a
sincere Friend, and so affable a Companion,” he quit the service with a sense of frustration.
He had thought the war excessively slow. The Virginia legislature had been niggardly in
voting money; the Virginia recruits had come forward reluctantly and had proved of poor
quality—Washington had hanged a few deserters and flogged others heavily. Virginia gave
him less pay than other colonies offered their troops. Desiring a regular commission such
as his half brother Lawrence had held, he applied in vain to the British commander in
North America, Lord Loudoun, to make good a promise that Braddock had given him.
Ambitious for both rank and honour, he showed a somewhat strident vigour in asserting his
desires and in complaining when they were denied. He returned to Mount Vernon
somewhat disillusioned.
Marriage and plantation life
Immediately on resigning his commission,
Washington was married (January 6, 1759) to Martha
Dandridge, the widow of Daniel Parke Custis. She
was a few months older than he, was the mother of
two children living and two dead, and possessed one
of the considerable fortunes of Virginia. Washington
had met her the previous March and had asked for her
hand before his campaign with Forbes. Though it
does not seem to have been a romantic love match,
the marriage united two harmonious temperaments
and proved happy. Martha was a good housewife, an
amiable companion, and a dignified hostess. Like
many wellborn women of the era, she had little
formal schooling, and Washington often helped her compose important letters.

Martha Washington and George
Washington and their children
Some estimates of the property brought to him by this
marriage have been exaggerated, but it did include a
number of slaves and about 15,000 acres (6,000
hectares), much of it valuable for its proximity to
Williamsburg. More important to Washington were
the two stepchildren, John Parke (“Jacky”) and
Martha Parke (“Patsy”) Custis, who at the time of the
marriage were six and four, respectively. He lavished
great affection and care upon them, worried greatly over Jacky’s waywardness, and was
overcome with grief when Patsy died just before the Revolution. Jacky died during the war,
leaving four children. Washington adopted two of them, a boy and a girl, and even signed
his letters to the boy as “your papa.” Himself childless, he thus had a real family.
From the time of his marriage Washington added to the care of Mount Vernon the
supervision of the Custis estate at the White House on the York River. As his holdings
expanded, they were divided into farms, each under its own overseer; but he minutely
inspected operations every day and according to one visitor often pulled off his coat and
performed ordinary labour. As he once wrote, “middling land under a man’s own eyes, is
more profitable than rich land at a distance.” Until the eve of the Revolution he devoted
himself to the duties and pleasures of a great landholder, varied by several weeks’
attendance every year in the House of Burgesses in Williamsburg. During 1760–74 he was
also a justice of the peace for Fairfax county, sitting in court in Alexandria.
In no light does Washington appear more characteristically than as one of the richest,
largest, and most industrious of Virginia planters. For six days a week he rose early and
worked hard; on Sundays he irregularly attended Pohick Church (16 times in 1760),
entertained company, wrote letters, made purchases and sales, and sometimes went fox
hunting. In these years he took snuff and smoked a pipe; throughout life he liked Madeira
wine and punch. Although wheat and tobacco were his staples, he practiced crop rotation
on a three-year or five-year plan. He had his own water-powered flour mill, blacksmith
shop, brick and charcoal kilns, carpenters, and masons. His fishery supplied shad, bass,
herring, and other catches, salted as food for his slaves. Coopers, weavers, and his own
shoemaker turned out barrels, cotton, linen, and woollen goods, and brogans for all needs.
In short, his estates, in accordance with his orders to overseers to “buy nothing you can
make yourselves,” were largely self-sufficient communities. But he did send large orders to
England for farm implements, tools, paint, fine textiles, hardware, and agricultural books
and hence was painfully aware of British commercial restrictions.

George Washington: painting
Washington was an innovative farmer and a responsible landowner. He experimented at
breeding cattle, acquired at least one buffalo, with the hope of proving its utility as a meat
animal, and kept stallions at stud. He also took pride in a peach and apple orchard.
His care of slaves was exemplary. He carefully clothed and fed them, engaged a doctor for
them by the year, generally refused to sell them—“I am principled against this kind of
traffic in the human species”—and administered correction mildly. They showed so much
attachment that few ran away.
He meanwhile played a prominent role in the social life of the Tidewater region. The
members of the council and House of Burgesses, a roster of influential Virginians, were all
friends. He visited the Byrds of Westover, the Lees of Stratford, the Carters of Shirley and
Sabine Hall, and the Lewises of Warner Hall; Mount Vernon often was busy with guests in
return. He liked house parties and afternoon tea on the Mount Vernon porch overlooking
the grand Potomac; he was fond of picnics, barbecues, and clambakes; and throughout life
he enjoyed dancing, frequently going to Alexandria for balls. Cards were a steady
diversion, and his accounts record sums lost at them, the largest reaching nearly £10. His
diary sometimes states that in bad weather he was “at home all day, over cards.” Billiards
was a rival amusement. Not only the theatre, when available, but also concerts, cockfights,
circuses, puppet shows, and exhibitions of animals received his patronage.
He insisted on the best clothes—coats, laced waistcoats, hats, coloured silk hose—bought
in London. The Virginia of the Randolphs, Corbins, Harrisons, Tylers, Nicholases, and
other prominent families had an aristocratic quality, and Washington liked to do things in a
large way. It has been computed that in the seven years prior to 1775, Mount Vernon had
2,000 guests, most of whom stayed to dinner if not overnight.
Prerevolutionary politics
Washington’s contented life was interrupted by the
rising storm in imperial affairs. The British ministry,
facing a heavy postwar debt, high home taxes, and
continued military costs in America, decided in 1764
to obtain revenue from the colonies. Up to that time,
Washington, though regarded by associates, in Col.
John L. Peyton’s words, as “a young man of an
extraordinary and exalted character,” had shown no signs of personal greatness and few
signs of interest in state affairs. The Proclamation of 1763 interdicting settlement beyond

the Alleghenies irked him, for he was interested in the Ohio Company, the Mississippi
Company, and other speculative western ventures. He nevertheless played a silent part in
the House of Burgesses and was a thoroughly loyal subject.
But he was present when Patrick Henry introduced his resolutions against the Stamp Act in
May 1765 and shortly thereafter gave token of his adherence to the cause of the colonial
Whigs against the Tory ministries of England. In 1768 he told George Mason at Mount
Vernon that he would take his musket on his shoulder whenever his country called him.
The next spring, on April 4, 1769, he sent Mason the Philadelphia nonimportation
resolutions with a letter declaring that it was necessary to resist the strokes of “our lordly
masters” in England; that, courteous remonstrances to Parliament having failed, he wholly
endorsed the resort to commercial warfare; and that as a last resort no man should scruple
to use arms in defense of liberty. When, the following month, the royal governor of
Virginia dissolved the House of Burgesses, he shared in the gathering, at the Raleigh
Tavern in Williamsburg, that drew up nonimportation resolutions, and he went further than
most of his neighbours in adhering to them. At that time and later he believed with most
Americans that peace need not be broken.
Late in 1770 he paid a land-hunting visit to Fort Pitt, where George Croghan was maturing
his plans for the proposed 14th colony of Vandalia. Washington directed his agent to locate
and survey 10,000 acres adjoining the Vandalia tract, and at one time he wished to share in
certain of Croghan’s schemes. But the Boston Tea Party of December 1773 and the bursting
of the Vandalia bubble at about the same time turned his eyes back to the East and the
threatening state of Anglo-American relations. He was not a member of the Virginia
committee of correspondence formed in 1773 to communicate with other colonies, but
when the Virginia legislators, meeting irregularly again at the Raleigh Tavern in May 1774,
called for a Continental Congress, he was present and signed the resolutions. Moreover, he
was a leading member of the first provincial convention or revolutionary legislature late
that summer, and to that body he made a speech that was much praised for its pithy
eloquence, declaring that “I will raise one thousand men, subsist them at my own expense,
and march myself at their head for the relief of Boston.”
The Virginia provincial convention promptly elected Washington one of the seven
delegates to the first Continental Congress. He was by this time known as a radical rather
than a moderate, and in several letters of the time he opposed a continuance of petitions to
the British crown, declaring that they would inevitably meet with a humiliating rejection.
“Shall we after this whine and cry for relief when we have already tried it in vain?” he

wrote. When the Congress met in Philadelphia on September 5, 1774, he was in his seat in
full uniform, and his participation in its councils marks the beginning of his national career.
His letters of the period show that, while still utterly opposed to the idea of independence,
he was determined never to submit “to the loss of those valuable rights and privileges,
which are essential to the happiness of every free State, and without which life, liberty, and
property are rendered totally insecure.” If the ministry pushed matters to an extremity, he
wrote, “more blood will be spilled on this occasion than ever before in American history.”
Though he served on none of the committees, he was a useful member, his advice being
sought on military matters and weight being attached to his advocacy of a nonexportation
as well as nonimportation agreement. He also helped to secure approval of the Suffolk
Resolves, which looked toward armed resistance as a last resort and did much to harden the
king’s heart against America.
Returning to Virginia in November, he took command of the volunteer companies drilling
there and served as chairman of the Committee of Safety in Fairfax county. Although the
province contained many experienced officers and Col. William Byrd of Westover had
succeeded Washington as commander in chief, the unanimity with which the Virginia
troops turned to Washington was a tribute to his reputation and personality; it was
understood that Virginia expected him to be its general. He was elected to the second
Continental Congress at the March 1775 session of the legislature and again set out for
Philadelphia.
Revolutionary leadership
Head of the colonial forces
The choice of Washington as commander in chief of the military forces of all the colonies
followed immediately upon the first fighting, though it was by no means inevitable and was
the product of partly artificial forces. The Virginia delegates differed upon his appointment.
Edmund Pendleton was, according to John Adams, “very full and clear against it,” and
Washington himself recommended Gen. Andrew Lewis for the post. It was chiefly the fruit
of a political bargain by which New England offered Virginia the chief command as its
price for the adoption and support of the New England army. This army had gathered
hastily and in force about Boston immediately after the clash of British troops and
American minutemen at Lexington and Concord on April 19, 1775. When the second
Continental Congress met in Philadelphia on May 10, one of its first tasks was to find a
permanent leadership for this force. On June 15, Washington, whose military counsel had
already proved invaluable on two committees, was nominated and chosen by unanimous

vote. Beyond the considerations noted, he owed being chosen to the facts that Virginia
stood with Massachusetts as one of the most powerful colonies; that his appointment would
augment the zeal of the Southern people; that he had gained an enduring reputation in the
Braddock campaign; and that his poise, sense, and resolution had impressed all the
delegates. The scene of his election, with Washington darting modestly into an adjoining
room and John Hancock flushing with jealous mortification, will always impress the
historical imagination; so also will the scene of July 3, 1775, when, wheeling his horse
under an elm in front of the troops paraded on Cambridge common, he drew his sword and
took command of the army investing Boston. News of Bunker Hill had reached him before
he was a day’s journey from Philadelphia, and he had expressed confidence of victory
when told how the militia had fought. In accepting the command, he refused any payment
beyond his expenses and called upon “every gentleman in the room” to bear witness that he
disclaimed fitness for it. At once he showed characteristic decision and energy in
organizing the raw volunteers, collecting provisions and munitions, and rallying Congress
and the colonies to his support.
The first phase of Washington’s command covered
the period from July 1775 to the British evacuation of
Boston in March 1776. In those eight months he
imparted discipline to the army, which at maximum
strength slightly exceeded 20,000; he dealt with
subordinates who, as John Adams said, quarrelled
“like cats and dogs”; and he kept the siege vigorously
alive. Having himself planned an invasion of Canada by Lake Champlain, to be entrusted
to Gen. Philip Schuyler, he heartily approved of Benedict Arnold’s proposal to march north
along the Kennebec River in Maine and take Quebec. Giving Arnold 1,100 men, he
instructed him to do everything possible to conciliate the Canadians. He was equally active
in encouraging privateers to attack British commerce. As fast as means offered, he
strengthened his army with ammunition and siege guns, having heavy artillery brought
from Fort Ticonderoga, New York, over the frozen roads early in 1776. His position was at
first precarious, for the Charles River pierced the centre of his lines investing Boston. If the
British general, Sir William Howe, had moved his 20 veteran regiments boldly up the
stream, he might have pierced Washington’s army and rolled either wing back to
destruction. But all the generalship was on Washington’s side. Seeing that Dorchester
Heights, just south of Boston, commanded the city and harbour and that Howe had
unaccountably failed to occupy it, he seized it on the night of March 4, 1776, placing his

Ticonderoga guns in position. The British naval commander declared that he could not
remain if the Americans were not dislodged, and Howe, after a storm disrupted his plans
for an assault, evacuated the city on March 17. He left 200 cannons and invaluable stores of
small arms and munitions. After collecting his booty, Washington hurried south to take up
the defense of New York.
Washington had won the first round, but there
remained five years of the war, during which the
American cause was repeatedly near complete
disaster. It is unquestionable that Washington’s
strength of character, his ability to hold the
confidence of army and people and to diffuse his own
courage among them, his unremitting activity, and his
strong common sense constituted the chief factors in
achieving American victory. He was not a great tactician: as Jefferson said later, he often
“failed in the field”; he was sometimes guilty of grave military blunders, the chief being his
assumption of a position on Long Island, New York, in 1776 that exposed his entire army
to capture the moment it was defeated. At the outset he was painfully inexperienced, the
wilderness fighting of the French war having done nothing to teach him the strategy of
maneuvering whole armies. One of his chief faults was his tendency to subordinate his own
judgment to that of the generals surrounding him; at every critical juncture, before Boston,
before New York, before Philadelphia, and in New Jersey, he called a council of war and in
almost every instance accepted its decision. Naturally bold and dashing—as he proved at
Trenton and Princeton, as well as at Germantown—he repeatedly adopted evasive and
delaying tactics on the advice of his associates; however, he did succeed in keeping a
strong army in existence and maintaining the flame of national spirit. When the auspicious
moment arrived, he planned the rapid movements that ended the war.
One element of Washington’s strength was his sternness as a disciplinarian. The army was
continually dwindling and refilling, politics largely governed the selection of officers by
Congress and the states, and the ill-fed, ill-clothed, ill-paid forces were often half-
prostrated by sickness and ripe for mutiny. Troops from each of the three sections, New
England, the middle states, and the South, showed a deplorable jealousy of the others.
Washington was rigorous in breaking cowardly, inefficient, and dishonest men and boasted
in front of Boston that he had “made a pretty good sort of slam among such kind of
officers.” Deserters and plunderers were flogged, and Washington once erected a gallows
40 feet (12 metres) high, writing, “I am determined if I can be justified in the proceeding,

Island
to hang two or three on it, as an example to others.” At the same time, the commander in
chief won the devotion of many of his men by his earnestness in demanding better
treatment for them from Congress. He complained of their short rations, declaring once that
they were forced to “eat every kind of horse food but hay.”
The darkest chapter in Washington’s military
leadership was opened when, reaching New York in
April 1776, he placed half his army, about 9,000 men,
under Israel Putnam, on the perilous position of
Brooklyn Heights, Long Island, where a British fleet
in the East River might cut off their retreat. He spent
a fortnight in May with the Continental Congress in
Philadelphia, then discussing the question of
independence; though no record of his utterances exists, there can be no doubt that he
advocated complete separation. His return to New York preceded but slightly the arrival of
the British army under Howe, which made its main encampment on Staten Island until its
whole strength of nearly 30,000 could be mobilized. On August 22, 1776, Howe moved
about 20,000 men across to Gravesend Bay on Long Island. Four days later, sending the
fleet under command of his brother Adm. Richard Howe to make a feint against New York
City, he thrust a crushing force along feebly protected roads against the American flank.
The patriots were outmaneuvered, defeated, and suffered a total loss of 5,000 men, of
whom 2,000 were captured. Their whole position might have been carried by storm, but,
fortunately for Washington, General Howe delayed. While the enemy lingered, Washington
succeeded under cover of a dense fog in ferrying the remaining force across the East River
to Manhattan, where he took up a fortified position. The British, suddenly landing on the
lower part of the island, drove back the Americans in a clash marked by disgraceful
cowardice on the part of troops from Connecticut and others. In a series of actions,
Washington was forced northward, more than once in danger of capture, until the loss of
his two Hudson River forts, one of them with 2,600 men, compelled him to retreat from
White Plains across the river into New Jersey. He retired toward the Delaware River while
his army melted away, until it seemed that armed resistance to the British was about to
expire.
The Trenton-Princeton campaign
It was at this darkest hour of the Revolution that Washington struck his brilliant blows at
Trenton and Princeton in New Jersey, reviving the hopes and energies of the nation. Howe,

believing that the American army soon would
dissolve totally, retired to New York, leaving strong
forces in Trenton and Burlington. Washington, at his
camp west of the Delaware River, planned a
simultaneous attack on both posts, using his whole
command of 6,000 men. But his subordinates in
charge of both wings failed him, and he was left on
the night of December 25, 1776, to march on Trenton
with about 2,400 men. With the help of Colonel John
Glover’s regiment, which was comprised of
fishermen and sailors from Marblehead,
Massachusetts, Washington and his troops were
ferried across the Delaware River. In the dead of night
and amid a blinding snowstorm, they then marched
10 miles (16 km) downstream and in the early hours of the morning caught the enemy at
Trenton unaware. In less than two hours and without the loss of a single man in battle,
Washington’s troops defeated the Hessians, killed their commander (Johann Rall), and
captured nearly 1,000 prisoners and arms and ammunition. This historic Christmas crossing
proved to be a turning point in the war, and it was immortalized for posterity by Emanuel
Gottlieb Leutze in his famous 1851 painting of the event. (The painting is historically
inaccurate: the depicted flag is anachronistic, the boats are the wrong size and shape, and it
is questionable whether Washington could have crossed the icy Delaware while standing in
the manner depicted.)
The immediate result of this American victory was that Gen. Charles Cornwallis hastened
with about 8,000 men to Trenton, where he found Washington strongly posted behind the
Assunpink Creek, skirmished with him, and decided to wait overnight “to bag the old fox.”
During the night, the wind shifted, the roads froze hard, and Washington was able to steal
away from camp (leaving his fires deceptively burning), march around Cornwallis’s rear,
and fall at daybreak upon the three British regiments at Princeton. These were put to flight
with a loss of 500 men, and Washington escaped with more captured munitions to a strong
position at Morristown, New Jersey. The effect of these victories heartened all Americans,
brought recruits flocking to camp in the spring, and encouraged foreign sympathizers with
the American cause.
Thus far the important successes had been won by Washington; then battlefield success fell
to others, while he was left to face popular apathy, military cabals, and the disaffection of

Congress. The year 1777 was marked by the British
capture of Philadelphia and the surrender of British
Gen. John Burgoyne’s invading army to Gen. Horatio
Gates at Saratoga, New York, followed by intrigues to
displace Washington from his command. Howe’s
main British army of 18,000 left New York by sea on
July 23, 1777, and landed on August 25 in Maryland,
not far below Philadelphia. Washington, despite his
inferiority of force—he had only 11,000 men, mostly militia and, in the marquis de
Lafayette’s words, “badly armed and worse clothed”—risked a pitched battle on September
11 at the fords of Brandywine Creek, about 13 miles (21 km) north of Wilmington,
Delaware. While part of the British force held the Americans engaged, General Cornwallis,
with the rest, made a secret 17-mile (27-km) detour and fell with crushing effect on the
American right and rear, the result being a complete defeat from which Washington was
fortunate to extricate his army in fairly good order. For a time he hoped to hold the
Schuylkill Fords, but the British passed them and on September 26 triumphantly marched
into Philadelphia. Congress fled to the interior of Pennsylvania, and Washington, after an
unsuccessful effort to repeat his stroke at Trenton against the British troops posted at
Germantown, had to take up winter quarters at Valley Forge. His army, twice beaten, ill
housed, and ill fed, with thousands of men “barefoot and otherwise naked,” was at the point
of exhaustion; it could not keep the field, for inside of a month it would have disappeared.
Under these circumstances, there is nothing that better proves the true fibre of
Washington’s character and the courage of his soul than the unyielding persistence with
which he held his strong position at Valley Forge through a winter of semistarvation, of
justified grumbling by his men, of harsh public criticism, and of captious meddling by a
Congress that was too weak to help him. In February Martha Washington arrived and
helped to organize entertainment for the soldiers.
Washington’s enemies seized the moment of his greatest weakness to give vent to an
antagonism that had been nourished by sectional jealousies of North against South, by the
ambition of small rivals, and by baseless accusations that he showed favouritism to such
foreigners as Lafayette. The intrigues of Thomas Conway, an Irish adventurer who had
served in the French army and had become an American general, enlisted Thomas Mifflin,
Charles Lee, Benjamin Rush, and others in an attempt to displace Washington. General
Gates appears to have been a tool of rather than a party to the plot, expecting that the chief
command would devolve upon himself. A faction of Congress sympathized with the

of Monmouth
movement and attempted to paralyze Washington by reorganizing the board of war, a body
vested with the general superintendence of operations, of which Gates became the
president; his chief of staff, James Wilkinson, the secretary; and Mifflin and Timothy
Pickering, members. Washington was well aware of the hostility in congress, of the
slanders spread by Rush and James Lovell of Massachusetts, and of the effect of forgeries
published in the American press by adroit British agents. He realized the intense jealousy
of many New Englanders, which made even John Adams write his wife that he was
thankful Burgoyne had not been captured by Washington, who would then “have been
deified. It is bad enough as it is.” But Washington decisively crushed the cabal: after the
loose tongue of Wilkinson disclosed Conway’s treachery, Washington sent the general on
November 9, 1777, proof of his knowledge of the whole affair.
With the conclusion of the French alliance in the
spring of 1778, the aspect of the war was radically
altered. The British army in Philadelphia, fearing that
a French fleet would blockade the Delaware while the
militia of New Jersey and Pennsylvania invested the
city, hastily retreated upon New York City.
Washington hoped to cut off part of the enemy and by
a hurried march with six brigades interposed himself
at the end of June between Sir Henry Clinton (who had succeeded Howe) and the New
Jersey coast. The result was the Battle of Monmouth on June 28, where a shrewd strategic
plan and vigorous assault were brought to naught by the treachery of Charles Lee. When
Lee ruined the attack by a sudden order to retreat, Washington hurried forward, fiercely
denounced him, and restored the line, but the golden opportunity had been lost. The British
made good their march to Sandy Hook, and Washington took up his quarters at New
Brunswick. Lee was arrested, court-martialed, and convicted on all three of the charges
made against him; but instead of being shot, as he deserved, he was sentenced to a
suspension from command for one year. The arrival of the French fleet under Adm.
Charles-Hector Estaing on July 1778 completed the isolation of the British, and Clinton
was thenceforth held to New York City and the surrounding area. Washington made his
headquarters in the highlands of the Hudson and distributed his troops in cantonments
around the city and in New Jersey.
The final decisive stroke of the war, the capture of Cornwallis at Yorktown, is to be
credited chiefly to Washington’s vision. With the domestic situation intensely gloomy early
in 1781, he was hampered by the feebleness of Congress, the popular discouragement, and

the lack of prompt and strong support by the French
fleet. A French army under the comte de Rochambeau
had arrived to reinforce him in 1780, and Washington
had pressed Admiral de Grasse to assist in an attack
upon either Cornwallis in the south or Clinton in New
York. In August the French admiral sent definite word
that he preferred the Chesapeake, with its large area
and deep water, as the scene of his operations; and within a week, on August 19, 1781,
Washington marched south with his army, leaving Gen. William Heath with 4,000 men to
hold West Point. He hurried his troops through New Jersey, embarked them on transports in
Delaware Bay, and landed them at Williamsburg, Virginia, where he had arrived on
September 14. Cornwallis had retreated to Yorktown and entrenched his army of 7,000
British regulars. Their works were completely invested before the end of the month; the
siege was pressed with vigour by the allied armies under Washington, consisting of 5,500
Continentals, 3,500 Virginia militia, and 5,000 French regulars; and on October 19
Cornwallis surrendered. By this campaign, probably the finest single display of
Washington’s generalship, the war was brought to a virtual close.
Washington remained during the winter of 1781–82
with the Continental Congress in Philadelphia,
exhorting it to maintain its exertions for liberty and to
settle the army’s claims for pay. He continued these
exhortations after he joined his command at
Newburgh on the Hudson in April 1782. He was
astounded and angered when some loose camp
suggestions found expression in a letter from Col.
Lewis Nicola offering a plan by which he should use
the army to make himself king. He blasted the
proposal with fierce condemnation. When the
discontent of his unpaid men came to a head in the
circulation of the “Newburgh Address” (an
anonymously written grievance) early in 1783, he
issued a general order censuring the paper and at a

Washington
and on December 4 took leave of his closest officers in an affecting scene at Fraunces
Tavern. Traveling south, on December 23, in a solemn ceremonial immortalized by the pen
of William Makepeace Thackeray, he resigned his commission to the Continental Congress
in the state senate chamber of Maryland in Annapolis and received the thanks of the nation.
His accounts of personal expenditures during his service, kept with minute exactness in his
own handwriting and totalling £24,700, without charge for salary, had been given the
controller of the treasury to be discharged. Washington left Annapolis at sunrise of
December 24 and before nightfall was at home in Mount Vernon.
In the next four years Washington found sufficient occupation in his estates, wishing to
close his days as a gentleman farmer and to give to agriculture as much energy and thought
as he had to the army. He enlarged the Mount Vernon house; he laid out the grounds anew,
with sunken walls, or ha-has; and he embarked on experiments with mahogany, palmetto,
pepper, and other foreign trees, and English grasses and grains. His farm manager during
the Revolution, a distant relative named Lund Washington, retired in 1785 and was
succeeded by a nephew, Maj. George Augustine Washington, who resided at Mount Vernon
until his death in 1792. Washington’s losses during the war had been heavy, caused by
neglect of his lands, stoppage of exportation, and depreciation of paper money, which cost
him hardly less than $30,000. He then attempted successfully to repair his fortunes, his
annual receipts from all his estates being from $10,000 to $15,000 a year. In 1784 he made
a tour of nearly 700 miles (1,125 km) to view the wildlands he owned to the westward,
Congress having made him a generous grant. As a national figure, he was constrained to
offer hospitality to old army friends, visitors from other states and nations, diplomats, and
Indian delegations, and he and his household seldom sat down to dinner alone.
Presidency
Postrevolutionary politics
Viewing the chaotic political condition of the United
States after 1783 with frank pessimism and declaring
(May 18, 1786) that “something must be done, or the
fabric must fall, for it is certainly tottering,”
Washington repeatedly wrote his friends urging steps
toward “an indissoluble union.” At first he believed
that the Articles of Confederation might be amended.
Later, especially after the shock of Shays’s Rebellion,
he took the view that a more radical reform was necessary but doubted as late as the end of

1786 that the time was ripe. His progress toward adoption of the idea of a federal
convention was, in fact, puzzlingly slow. Although John Jay assured him in March 1786
that breakup of the nation seemed near and opinion for a constitutional convention was
crystallizing, Washington remained noncommittal. But, despite long hesitations, he
earnestly supported the proposal for a federal impost, warning the states that their policy
must decide “whether the Revolution must ultimately be considered a blessing or a curse.”
And his numerous letters to the leading men of the country assisted greatly to form a
sentiment favourable to a more perfect union. Some understanding being necessary
between Virginia and Maryland regarding the navigation of the Potomac, commissioners
from the two states had met at Mount Vernon in the spring of 1785; from this seed sprang
the federal convention. Washington approved in advance the call for a gathering of all the
states to meet in Philadelphia in May 1787 to “render the Constitution of the Federal
Government adequate to the exigencies of the Union.” But he was again hesitant about
attending, partly because he felt tired and infirm, partly because of doubts about the
outcome. Although he hoped to the last to be excused, he was chosen one of Virginia’s five
delegates.
Washington arrived in Philadelphia on May 13, the day before the opening of the
Constitutional Convention, and as soon as a quorum was obtained he was unanimously
chosen its president. For four months he presided over the convention, breaking his silence
only once upon a minor question of congressional apportionment. Although he said little in
debate, no one did more outside the hall to insist on stern measures. “My wish is,” he
wrote, “that the convention may adopt no temporizing expedients, but probe the defects of
the Constitution to the bottom, and provide a radical cure.” His weight of character did
more than any other single force to bring the convention to an agreement and obtain
ratification of the instrument afterward. He did not believe it perfect, though his precise
criticisms of it are unknown. But his support gave it victory in Virginia, where he sent
copies to Patrick Henry and other leaders with a hint that the alternative to adoption was
anarchy, declaring that “it or dis-union is before us to chuse from.” He received and
personally circulated copies of The Federalist. When ratification was obtained, he wrote to
leaders in the various states urging that men staunchly favourable to it be elected to
Congress. For a time he sincerely believed that, the new framework completed, he would
be allowed to retire again to privacy. But all eyes immediately turned to him for the first
president. He alone commanded the respect of both the parties engendered by the struggle
over ratification, and he alone would be able to give prestige to the republic throughout
Europe. In no state was any other name considered. The electors chosen in the first days of

Washington delivering his
inaugural address
1789 cast a unanimous vote for him, and reluctantly—for his love of peace, his distrust of
his own abilities, and his fear that his motives in advocating the new government might be
misconstrued all made him unwilling—he accepted.
On April 16, after receiving congressional notification
of the honour, he set out from Mount Vernon,
reaching New York City in time to be inaugurated on
April 30 (see primary source document: First
Inaugural Address). His journey northward was a
celebratory procession as people in every town and
village through which he passed turned out to greet
him, often with banners and speeches, and in some
places with triumphal arches. He came across the Hudson River in a specially built barge
decorated in red, white, and blue. The inaugural ceremony was performed on Wall Street,
near the spot now marked by John Quincy Adams Ward’s statue of Washington. A great
crowd broke into cheers as, standing on the balcony of Federal Hall, he took the oath
administered by Chancellor Robert Livingston and retired indoors to read Congress his
inaugural address. Washington was clad in a brown suit of American manufacture, but he
wore white stockings and a sword after the fashion of European courts.
Martha was as reluctant as her husband to resume public life. But a month later she came
from Mount Vernon to join him. She, too, was greeted wildly on her way. And when
Washington crossed the Hudson to bring her to Manhattan, guns boomed in salute. The
Washingtons, to considerable public criticism, traveled about in a coach-and-four like
monarchs. Moreover, during his presidency, Washington did not shake hands, and he met
his guests on state occasions while standing on a raised platform and displaying a sword on
his hip. Slowly, feeling his way, Washington was defining the style of the first president of
a country in the history of the world. The people, too, were adjusting to a government
without a king. Even the question of how to address a president had to be discussed. It was
decided that in a republic the simple salutation “Mr. President” would do.
The Washington administration
Washington’s administration of the government in the next eight years was marked by the
caution, the methodical precision, and the sober judgment that had always characterized
him. He regarded himself as standing aloof from party divisions and emphasized his
position as president of the whole country by touring first through the Northern states and

Washington
later through the Southern. A painstaking inquiry into
all the problems confronting the new nation laid the
basis for a series of judicious recommendations to
Congress in his first message. In selecting the four
members of his first cabinet—Thomas Jefferson as
secretary of state, Alexander Hamilton as secretary of
treasury, Henry Knox as secretary of war, and
Edmund Randolph as attorney general—Washington
balanced the two parties evenly. But he leaned with especial weight upon Hamilton, who
supported his scheme for the federal assumption of state debts, took his view that the bill
establishing the Bank of the United States was constitutional, and in general favoured
strengthening the authority of the federal government. Distressed when the inevitable clash
between Jefferson and Hamilton arose, he tried to keep harmony, writing frankly to each
and refusing to accept their resignations.
But when war was declared between France and England in 1793, he took Hamilton’s view
that the United States should completely disregard the treaty of alliance with France and
pursue a course of strict neutrality, while he acted decisively to stop the improper
operations of the French minister, Edmond-Charles Genêt. He had a firm belief that the
United States must insist on its national identity, strength, and dignity. His object, he wrote,
was to keep the country “free from political connections with every other country, to see
them independent of all, and under the influence of none. In a word, I want an American
character that the powers of Europe may be convinced that we act for ourselves, and not for
others.” The sequel was the resignation of Jefferson at the close of 1793, the two men
parting on good terms and Washington praising Jefferson’s “integrity and talents.” The
suppression of the Whiskey Rebellion in 1794 by federal troops whom Hamilton led in
person and the dispatch of John Jay to conclude a treaty of commerce with Great Britain
tended further to align Washington with the federalists. Although the general voice of the
people compelled him to acquiesce reluctantly to a second term in 1792 and his election
that year was again unanimous, during his last four years in office he suffered from a fierce
personal and partisan animosity. This culminated when the publication of the terms of the
Jay Treaty, which Washington signed in August 1795, provoked a bitter discussion, and the
House of Representatives called upon the president for the instructions and correspondence
relating to the treaty. These Washington, who had already clashed with the Senate on
foreign affairs, refused to deliver, and, in the face of an acrimonious debate, he firmly
maintained his position.

Washington's Farewell Address
George Washington on Mount
Rushmore
Early in his first term, Washington, who by education and natural inclination was minutely
careful of the proprieties of life, established the rules of a virtual republican court. In both
New York and Philadelphia he rented the best houses procurable, refusing to accept the
hospitality of George Clinton, for he believed the head of the nation should be no man’s
guest. He returned no calls and shook hands with no one, acknowledging salutations by a
formal bow. He drove in a coach drawn by four or six smart horses, with outriders and
lackeys in rich livery. He attended receptions dressed in a black velvet suit with gold
buckles, with yellow gloves, powdered hair, a cocked hat with an ostrich plume in one
hand, and a sword in a white leather scabbard. After being overwhelmed by callers, he
announced that, except for a weekly levee open to all, persons desiring to see him had to
make appointments in advance. On Friday afternoons the first lady held informal
receptions, at which the president appeared. Although the presidents of the Continental
Congress had made their tables partly public, Washington, who entertained largely, inviting
members of Congress in rotation, insisted that his hospitality be private. He served good
wines and the menus were elaborate, but such visitors as Pennsylvania Sen. William
Maclay complained that the atmosphere was too “solemn.” Indeed, his simple ceremony
offended many of the more radical anti-federalists, who did not share his sense of its fitness
and accused the president of conducting himself like a king. But his cold and reserved
manner was caused by native diffidence rather than any excessive sense of dignity.
Retirement
Earnestly desiring leisure, feeling a decline of his
physical powers, and wincing under abuses of the
opposition, Washington refused to yield to the general
pressure for a third term. This refusal was blended
with a testament of sagacious advice to his country in
the Farewell Address (see original text) of September
19, 1796, written largely by Hamilton but remolded
by Washington and expressing his ideas. Retiring in
March 1797 to Mount Vernon, he devoted himself for
the last two and a half years of his life to his family,
farm operations, and care of his slaves. In 1798 his
seclusion was briefly interrupted when the prospect of
war with France caused his appointment as commander in chief of the provisional army,
and he was much worried by the political quarrels over high commissions; but the war
cloud passed away.

procession
On December 12, 1799, after riding on horseback for
several hours in cold and snow, he returned home
exhausted and was attacked late the next day with
quinsy or acute laryngitis. He was bled heavily four
times and given gargles of “molasses, vinegar and
butter,” and a blister of cantharides (a preparation of
dried beetles) was placed on his throat, his strength
meanwhile rapidly sinking. He faced the end with
characteristic serenity, saying, “I die hard, but I am
not afraid to go,” and later: “I feel myself going. I
thank you for your attentions; but I pray you to take
no more trouble about me. Let me go off quietly. I
cannot last long.” After giving instructions to his
secretary, Tobias Lear, about his burial, he died at
10:00 PM on December 14. The news of his death placed the entire country in mourning,
and the sentiment of the country endorsed the famous words of Henry (“Light-Horse
Harry”) Lee, embodied in resolutions that John Marshall introduced in the House of
Representatives, that he was “first in war, first in peace, and first in the hearts of his
countrymen.” When the news reached Europe, the British channel fleet and the armies of
Napoleon paid tribute to his memory, and many of the leaders of the time joined in
according him a preeminent place among the heroes of history. His fellow citizens
memorialized him forever by naming the newly created capital city of the young nation for
him while he was still alive. Later, one of the states of union would bear his name—the
only state named for an individual American. Moreover, counties in 32 states were given
his name, and in time it also could be found in 121 postal addresses. The people of the
United States have continued to glory in knowing him as “the Father of His Country,” an
accolade he was pleased to accept, even though it pained him that he fathered no children
of his own. For almost a century beginning in the 1770s, Washington was the uncontested
giant in the American pantheon of greats, but only until Abraham Lincoln was enshrined
there after another critical epoch in the life of the country.

Washington’s father, Augustine Washington, had gone to school in England, tasted seafaring life, and then settled down to manage his growing Virginia estates. His mother was Mary Ball, whom Augustine, a widower, had married early the previous year. Washington’s paternal lineage had some distinction; an early forebear was described as a “gentleman,” Henry VIII later gave the family lands, and its members held various offices. But family fortunes fell with the Puritan revolution in England, and John Washington, grandfather of Augustine, migrated in 1657 to Virginia. The ancestral home at Sulgrave, Northamptonshire, is maintained as a Washington memorial. Little definite information exists on any of the line until Augustine. He was an energetic, ambitious man who acquired much land, built mills, took an interest in opening iron mines, and sent his two eldest sons to England for schooling. By his first wife, Jane Butler, he had four children. By his second wife, Mary Ball, he had six. Augustine died April 12, 1743. Childhood and youth Little is known of George Washington’s early childhood, spent largely on the Ferry Farm on the Rappahannock River, opposite Fredericksburg, Virginia. Mason L. Weems’s stories of the hatchet and cherry tree and of young Washington’s repugnance to fighting are apocryphal efforts to fill a manifest gap. He attended school irregularly from his 7th to his 15th year, first with the local church sexton and later with a schoolmaster named Williams. Some of his  George Washington   George Washington: map schoolboy papers survive. He was fairly well trained in practical mathematics—gauging, several types of mensuration, and such trigonometry as was useful in surveying. He studied geography, possibly had a little Latin, and certainly read some of The Spectator and other English classics. The copybook in which he transcribed at 14 a set of moral precepts, or Rules of Civility and Decent Behaviour in Company and Conversation, was carefully preserved. His best training, however, was given him by practical men and outdoor occupations, not by books. He mastered tobacco growing and stock raising, and early in his teens he was sufficiently familiar with surveying to plot the fields about him. At his father’s death, the 11-year-old boy became the ward of his half brother Lawrence, a man of fine character who gave him wise and affectionate care. Lawrence inherited the beautiful estate of Little Hunting Creek, which had been granted to the original settler, John Washington, and which Augustine had done much since 1738 to develop. Lawrence married Anne (Nancy) Fairfax, daughter of Col. William Fairfax, a cousin and agent of Lord Fairfax and one of the chief proprietors of the region. Lawrence also built a house and named the 2,500-acre (1,000-hectare) holding Mount Vernon in honour of the admiral under whom he had served in the siege of Cartagena. Living there chiefly with Lawrence (though he spent some time near Fredericksburg with his other half brother, Augustine, called Austin), George entered a more spacious and polite world. Anne Fairfax Washington was a woman of charm, grace, and culture; Lawrence had brought from his English school and naval service much knowledge and experience. A valued neighbour and relative, George William Fairfax, whose large estate, Belvoir, was about 4 miles (6 km) distant, and other relatives by marriage, the Carlyles of Alexandria, helped form George’s mind and manners. The youth turned first to surveying as a profession. Lord Fairfax, a middle-aged bachelor who owned more than 5,000,000 acres (2,000,000 hectares) in northern Virginia and the Shenandoah Valley, came to America in 1746 to live with his cousin George William at Belvoir and to look after his properties. Two years later he sent to the Shenandoah Valley a party to survey and plot his lands to make regular tenants of the squatters moving in from Pennsylvania. With the official surveyor of Prince William county in charge, Washington went along as assistant. The 16-year-old lad kept a disjointed diary of the trip, which shows skill in observation. He describes the discomfort of sleeping under “one thread Bear blanket with double its Weight of Vermin such as Lice Fleas & c”; an encounter with an  George Washington   Mount Vernon Indian war party bearing a scalp; the Pennsylvania-German emigrants, “as ignorant a set of people as the Indians they would never speak English but when spoken to they speak all Dutch”; and the serving of roast wild turkey on “a Large Chip,” for “as for dishes we had none.” The following year (1749), aided by Lord Fairfax, Washington received an appointment as official surveyor of Culpeper county, and for more than two years he was kept almost constantly busy. Surveying not only in Culpeper but also in Frederick and Augusta counties, he made journeys far beyond the Tidewater region into the western wilderness. The experience taught him resourcefulness and endurance and toughened him in both body and mind. Coupled with Lawrence’s ventures in land, it also gave him an interest in western development that endured throughout his life. He was always disposed to speculate in western holdings and to view favourably projects for colonizing the West, and he greatly resented the limitations that the crown in time laid on the westward movement. In 1752 Lord Fairfax determined to take up his final residence in the Shenandoah Valley and settled there in a log hunting lodge, which he called Greenway Court after a Kentish manor of his family’s. There Washington was sometimes entertained and had access to a small library that Fairfax had begun accumulating at Oxford. The years 1751–52 marked a turning point in Washington’s life, for they placed him in control of Mount Vernon. Lawrence, stricken by tuberculosis, went to Barbados in 1751 for his health, taking George along. From this sole journey beyond the present borders of the United States, Washington returned with the light scars of an attack of smallpox. In July of the next year, Lawrence died, making George executor and residuary heir of his estate should his daughter, Sarah, die without issue. As she died within two months, Washington at age 20 became head of one of the best Virginia estates. He always thought farming the “most delectable” of pursuits. “It is honorable,” he wrote, “it is amusing, and, with superior judgment, it is profitable.” And, of all the spots for farming, he thought Mount Vernon the best. “No estate in United America,” he assured an English correspondent, “is more pleasantly situated than this.” His greatest pride in later days was to be regarded as the first farmer of the land. He gradually increased the estate until it exceeded 8,000 acres (3,000 hectares). He enlarged the house in 1760 and made further enlargements and improvements on the house  George Washington   The Farmer, George Washington and its landscaping in 1784–86. He also tried to keep abreast of the latest scientific advances. For the next 20 years the main background of Washington’s life was the work and society of Mount Vernon. He gave assiduous attention to the rotation of crops, fertilization of the soil, and the management of livestock. He had to manage the 18 slaves that came with the estate and others he bought later; by 1760 he had paid taxes on 49 slaves—though he strongly disapproved of the institution and hoped for some mode of abolishing it. At the time of his death, more than 300 slaves were housed in the quarters on his property. He had been unwilling to sell slaves lest families be broken up, even though the increase in their numbers placed a burden on him for their upkeep and gave him a larger force of workers than he required, especially after he gave up the cultivation of tobacco. In his will, he bequeathed the slaves in his possession to his wife and ordered that upon her death they be set free, declaring also that the young, the aged, and the infirm among them “shall be comfortably cloathed & fed by my heirs.” Still, this accounted for only about half the slaves on his property. The other half, owned by his wife, were entailed to the Custis estate, so that on her death they were destined to pass to her heirs. However, she freed all the slaves in 1800 after his death. For diversion Washington was fond of riding, fox hunting, and dancing, of such theatrical performances as he could reach, and of duck hunting and sturgeon fishing. He liked billiards and cards and not only subscribed to racing associations but also ran his own horses in races. In all outdoor pursuits, from wrestling to colt breaking, he excelled. A friend of the 1750s describes him as “straight as an Indian, measuring six feet two inches in his stockings”; as very muscular and broad-shouldered but, though large-boned, weighing only 175 pounds; and as having long arms and legs. His penetrating blue-gray eyes were overhung by heavy brows, his nose was large and straight, and his mouth was large and firmly closed. “His movements and gestures are graceful, his walk majestic, and he is a splendid horseman.” He soon became prominent in community affairs, was an active member and later vestryman of the Episcopal church, and as early as 1755 expressed a desire to stand for the Virginia House of Burgesses. Prerevolutionary military and political career Early military career  George Washington   George Washington: sketch map Traditions of John Washington’s feats as Indian fighter and Lawrence Washington’s talk of service days helped imbue George with military ambition. Just after Lawrence’s death, Lieut. Gov. Robert Dinwiddie appointed George adjutant for the southern district of Virginia at £100 a year (November 1752). In 1753 he became adjutant of the Northern Neck and Eastern Shore. Later that year, Dinwiddie found it necessary to warn the French to desist from their encroachments on Ohio Valley lands claimed by the crown. After sending one messenger who failed to reach the goal, he determined to dispatch Washington. On the day he received his orders, October 31, 1753, Washington set out for the French posts. His party consisted of a Dutchman to serve as interpreter, the expert scout Christopher Gist as guide, and four others, two of them experienced traders with the Indians. Theoretically, Great Britain and France were at peace. Actually, war impended, and Dinwiddie’s message was an ultimatum: the French must get out or be put out. The journey proved rough, perilous, and futile. Washington’s party left what is now Cumberland, Maryland, in the middle of November and, despite wintry weather and impediments of the wilderness, reached Fort LeBoeuf, at what is now Waterford, Pennsylvania, 20 miles (32 km) south of Lake Erie, without delay. The French commander was courteous but adamant. As Washington reported, his officers “told me, That it was their absolute Design to take possession of the Ohio, and by God they would do it.” Eager to carry this alarming news back, Washington pushed off hurriedly with Gist. He was lucky to have gotten back alive. An Indian fired at them at 15 paces but missed. When they crossed the Allegheny River on a raft, Washington was jerked into the ice-filled stream but saved himself by catching one of the timbers. That night he almost froze in his wet clothing. He reached Williamsburg, Virginia, on January 16, 1754, where he hastily penned a record of the journey. Dinwiddie, who was labouring to convince the crown of the seriousness of the French threat, had it printed, and when he sent it to London, it was reprinted in three different forms. The enterprising governor forthwith planned an expedition to hold the Ohio country. He made Joshua Fry colonel of a provincial regiment, appointed Washington lieutenant colonel, and set them to recruiting troops. Two agents of the Ohio Company, which Lawrence Washington and others had formed to develop lands on the upper Potomac and Ohio rivers, had begun building a fort at what later became Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. Dinwiddie, ready to launch into his own war, sent Washington with two companies to  George Washington   reinforce this post. In April 1754 the lieutenant colonel set out from Alexandria with about 160 men at his back. He marched to Cumberland only to learn that the French had anticipated the British blow; they had taken possession of the fort of the Ohio Company and had renamed it Fort Duquesne. Happily, the Indians of the area offered support. Washington therefore struggled cautiously forward to within about 40 miles (60 km) of the French position and erected his own post at Great Meadows, near what is now Confluence, Pennsylvania. From this base, he made a surprise attack (May 28, 1754) upon an advance detachment of 30 French, killing the commander, Coulon de Jumonville, and nine others and taking the rest prisoners. The French and Indian War had begun. Washington at once received promotion to a full colonelcy and was reinforced, commanding a considerable body of Virginia and North Carolina troops, with Indian auxiliaries. But his attack soon brought the whole French force down upon him. They drove his 350 men into the Great Meadows fort (Fort Necessity) on July 3, besieged it with 700 men, and, after an all-day fight, compelled him to surrender. The construction of the fort had been a blunder, for it lay in a waterlogged creek bottom, was commanded on three sides by forested elevations approaching it closely, and was too far from Washington’s supports. The French agreed to let the disarmed colonials march back to Virginia with the honours of war, but they compelled Washington to promise that Virginia would not build another fort on the Ohio for a year and to sign a paper acknowledging responsibility for “l’assassinat” of de Jumonville, a word that Washington later explained he did not rightly understand. He returned to Virginia, chagrined but proud, to receive the thanks of the House of Burgesses and to find that his name had been mentioned in the London gazettes. His remark in a letter to his brother that “I have heard the bullets whistle; and believe me, there is something charming in the sound” was commented on humorously by the author Horace Walpole and sarcastically by King George II. The arrival of Gen. Edward Braddock and his army in Virginia in February 1755, as part of the triple plan of campaign that called for his advance on Fort Duquesne and in New York Gov. William Shirley’s capture of Fort Niagara and Sir William Johnson’s capture of Crown Point, brought Washington new opportunities and responsibilities. He had resigned his commission in October 1754 in resentment of the slighting treatment and underpayment of colonial officers and particularly because of an untactful order of the British war office that provincial officers of whatever rank would be subordinate to any officer holding the king’s commission. But he ardently desired a part in the war; “my inclinations,” he wrote a friend, “are strongly bent to arms.” When Braddock showed appreciation of his merits and invited him to join the expedition as personal aide-de-camp, with the courtesy title of  George Washington   colonel, he therefore accepted. His self-reliance, decision, and masterfulness soon became apparent. At table he had frequent disputes with Braddock, who, when contractors failed to deliver their supplies, attacked the colonials as supine and dishonest while Washington defended them warmly. His freedom of utterance is proof of Braddock’s esteem. Braddock accepted Washington’s unwise advice that he divide his army, leaving half of it to come up with the slow wagons and cattle train and taking the other half forward against Fort Duquesne at a rapid pace. Washington was ill with fever during June but joined the advance guard in a covered wagon on July 8, begged to lead the march on Fort Duquesne with his Virginians and Indian allies, and was by Braddock’s side when on July 9 the army was ambushed and bloodily defeated. In this defeat Washington displayed the combination of coolness and determination, the alliance of unconquerable energy with complete poise, that was the secret of so many of his successes. So ill that he had to use a pillow instead of a saddle and that Braddock ordered his body servant to keep special watch over him, Washington was, nevertheless, everywhere at once. At first he followed Braddock as the general bravely tried to rally his men to push either forward or backward, the wisest course the circumstances permitted. Then he rode back to bring up the Virginians from the rear and rallied them with effect on the flank. To him was largely due the escape of the force. His exposure of his person was as reckless as Braddock’s, who was fatally wounded on his fifth horse; Washington had two horses shot out from under him and his clothes cut by four bullets without being hurt. He was at Braddock’s deathbed, helped bring the troops back, and was repaid by being appointed, in August 1755, while still only 23 years old, commander of all Virginia troops. But no part of his later service was conspicuous. Finding that a Maryland captain who held a royal commission would not obey him, he rode north in February 1756 to Boston to have the question settled by the commander in chief in America, Governor Shirley, and, bearing a letter from Dinwiddie, had no difficulty in carrying his point. On his return he plunged into a multitude of vexations. He had to protect a weak, thinly settled frontier nearly 400 miles (650 km) in length with only some 700 ill-disciplined colonial troops, to cope with a legislature unwilling to support him, to meet attacks on the drunkenness and inefficiency of the soldiers, and to endure constant wilderness hardships. It is not strange that in 1757 his health failed and in the closing weeks of that year he was so ill of a “bloody flux” (dysentery) that his physician ordered him home to Mount Vernon. George Washington   George Washington: wedding to Martha Dandridge Custis George Washington: Mount Vernon map In the spring of 1758 he had recovered sufficiently to return to duty as colonel in command of all Virginia troops. As part of the grand sweep of several armies organized by British statesman William Pitt the Elder, Gen. John Forbes led a new advance upon Fort Duquesne. Forbes resolved not to use Braddock’s road but to cut a new one west from Raystown, Pennsylvania. Washington disapproved of the route but played an important part in the movement. Late in the autumn the French evacuated and burned Fort Duquesne, and Forbes reared Fort Pitt on the site. Washington, who had just been elected to the House of Burgesses, was able to resign with the honorary rank of brigadier general. Although his officers expressed regret at the “loss of such an excellent Commander, such a sincere Friend, and so affable a Companion,” he quit the service with a sense of frustration. He had thought the war excessively slow. The Virginia legislature had been niggardly in voting money; the Virginia recruits had come forward reluctantly and had proved of poor quality—Washington had hanged a few deserters and flogged others heavily. Virginia gave him less pay than other colonies offered their troops. Desiring a regular commission such as his half brother Lawrence had held, he applied in vain to the British commander in North America, Lord Loudoun, to make good a promise that Braddock had given him. Ambitious for both rank and honour, he showed a somewhat strident vigour in asserting his desires and in complaining when they were denied. He returned to Mount Vernon somewhat disillusioned. Marriage and plantation life Immediately on resigning his commission, Washington was married (January 6, 1759) to Martha Dandridge, the widow of Daniel Parke Custis. She was a few months older than he, was the mother of two children living and two dead, and possessed one of the considerable fortunes of Virginia. Washington had met her the previous March and had asked for her hand before his campaign with Forbes. Though it does not seem to have been a romantic love match, the marriage united two harmonious temperaments and proved happy. Martha was a good housewife, an amiable companion, and a dignified hostess. Like many wellborn women of the era, she had little formal schooling, and Washington often helped her compose important letters. George Washington   Martha Washington and George Washington and their children Some estimates of the property brought to him by this marriage have been exaggerated, but it did include a number of slaves and about 15,000 acres (6,000 hectares), much of it valuable for its proximity to Williamsburg. More important to Washington were the two stepchildren, John Parke (“Jacky”) and Martha Parke (“Patsy”) Custis, who at the time of the marriage were six and four, respectively. He lavished great affection and care upon them, worried greatly over Jacky’s waywardness, and was overcome with grief when Patsy died just before the Revolution. Jacky died during the war, leaving four children. Washington adopted two of them, a boy and a girl, and even signed his letters to the boy as “your papa.” Himself childless, he thus had a real family. From the time of his marriage Washington added to the care of Mount Vernon the supervision of the Custis estate at the White House on the York River. As his holdings expanded, they were divided into farms, each under its own overseer; but he minutely inspected operations every day and according to one visitor often pulled off his coat and performed ordinary labour. As he once wrote, “middling land under a man’s own eyes, is more profitable than rich land at a distance.” Until the eve of the Revolution he devoted himself to the duties and pleasures of a great landholder, varied by several weeks’ attendance every year in the House of Burgesses in Williamsburg. During 1760–74 he was also a justice of the peace for Fairfax county, sitting in court in Alexandria. In no light does Washington appear more characteristically than as one of the richest, largest, and most industrious of Virginia planters. For six days a week he rose early and worked hard; on Sundays he irregularly attended Pohick Church (16 times in 1760), entertained company, wrote letters, made purchases and sales, and sometimes went fox hunting. In these years he took snuff and smoked a pipe; throughout life he liked Madeira wine and punch. Although wheat and tobacco were his staples, he practiced crop rotation on a three-year or five-year plan. He had his own water-powered flour mill, blacksmith shop, brick and charcoal kilns, carpenters, and masons. His fishery supplied shad, bass, herring, and other catches, salted as food for his slaves. Coopers, weavers, and his own shoemaker turned out barrels, cotton, linen, and woollen goods, and brogans for all needs. In short, his estates, in accordance with his orders to overseers to “buy nothing you can make yourselves,” were largely self-sufficient communities. But he did send large orders to England for farm implements, tools, paint, fine textiles, hardware, and agricultural books and hence was painfully aware of British commercial restrictions. George Washington   George Washington: painting Washington was an innovative farmer and a responsible landowner. He experimented at breeding cattle, acquired at least one buffalo, with the hope of proving its utility as a meat animal, and kept stallions at stud. He also took pride in a peach and apple orchard. His care of slaves was exemplary. He carefully clothed and fed them, engaged a doctor for them by the year, generally refused to sell them—“I am principled against this kind of traffic in the human species”—and administered correction mildly. They showed so much attachment that few ran away. He meanwhile played a prominent role in the social life of the Tidewater region. The members of the council and House of Burgesses, a roster of influential Virginians, were all friends. He visited the Byrds of Westover, the Lees of Stratford, the Carters of Shirley and Sabine Hall, and the Lewises of Warner Hall; Mount Vernon often was busy with guests in return. He liked house parties and afternoon tea on the Mount Vernon porch overlooking the grand Potomac; he was fond of picnics, barbecues, and clambakes; and throughout life he enjoyed dancing, frequently going to Alexandria for balls. Cards were a steady diversion, and his accounts record sums lost at them, the largest reaching nearly £10. His diary sometimes states that in bad weather he was “at home all day, over cards.” Billiards was a rival amusement. Not only the theatre, when available, but also concerts, cockfights, circuses, puppet shows, and exhibitions of animals received his patronage. He insisted on the best clothes—coats, laced waistcoats, hats, coloured silk hose—bought in London. The Virginia of the Randolphs, Corbins, Harrisons, Tylers, Nicholases, and other prominent families had an aristocratic quality, and Washington liked to do things in a large way. It has been computed that in the seven years prior to 1775, Mount Vernon had 2,000 guests, most of whom stayed to dinner if not overnight. Prerevolutionary politics Washington’s contented life was interrupted by the rising storm in imperial affairs. The British ministry, facing a heavy postwar debt, high home taxes, and continued military costs in America, decided in 1764 to obtain revenue from the colonies. Up to that time, Washington, though regarded by associates, in Col. John L. Peyton’s words, as “a young man of an extraordinary and exalted character,” had shown no signs of personal greatness and few signs of interest in state affairs. The Proclamation of 1763 interdicting settlement beyond  George Washington   the Alleghenies irked him, for he was interested in the Ohio Company, the Mississippi Company, and other speculative western ventures. He nevertheless played a silent part in the House of Burgesses and was a thoroughly loyal subject. But he was present when Patrick Henry introduced his resolutions against the Stamp Act in May 1765 and shortly thereafter gave token of his adherence to the cause of the colonial Whigs against the Tory ministries of England. In 1768 he told George Mason at Mount Vernon that he would take his musket on his shoulder whenever his country called him. The next spring, on April 4, 1769, he sent Mason the Philadelphia nonimportation resolutions with a letter declaring that it was necessary to resist the strokes of “our lordly masters” in England; that, courteous remonstrances to Parliament having failed, he wholly endorsed the resort to commercial warfare; and that as a last resort no man should scruple to use arms in defense of liberty. When, the following month, the royal governor of Virginia dissolved the House of Burgesses, he shared in the gathering, at the Raleigh Tavern in Williamsburg, that drew up nonimportation resolutions, and he went further than most of his neighbours in adhering to them. At that time and later he believed with most Americans that peace need not be broken. Late in 1770 he paid a land-hunting visit to Fort Pitt, where George Croghan was maturing his plans for the proposed 14th colony of Vandalia. Washington directed his agent to locate and survey 10,000 acres adjoining the Vandalia tract, and at one time he wished to share in certain of Croghan’s schemes. But the Boston Tea Party of December 1773 and the bursting of the Vandalia bubble at about the same time turned his eyes back to the East and the threatening state of Anglo-American relations. He was not a member of the Virginia committee of correspondence formed in 1773 to communicate with other colonies, but when the Virginia legislators, meeting irregularly again at the Raleigh Tavern in May 1774, called for a Continental Congress, he was present and signed the resolutions. Moreover, he was a leading member of the first provincial convention or revolutionary legislature late that summer, and to that body he made a speech that was much praised for its pithy eloquence, declaring that “I will raise one thousand men, subsist them at my own expense, and march myself at their head for the relief of Boston.” The Virginia provincial convention promptly elected Washington one of the seven delegates to the first Continental Congress. He was by this time known as a radical rather than a moderate, and in several letters of the time he opposed a continuance of petitions to the British crown, declaring that they would inevitably meet with a humiliating rejection. “Shall we after this whine and cry for relief when we have already tried it in vain?” he  George Washington   wrote. When the Congress met in Philadelphia on September 5, 1774, he was in his seat in full uniform, and his participation in its councils marks the beginning of his national career. His letters of the period show that, while still utterly opposed to the idea of independence, he was determined never to submit “to the loss of those valuable rights and privileges, which are essential to the happiness of every free State, and without which life, liberty, and property are rendered totally insecure.” If the ministry pushed matters to an extremity, he wrote, “more blood will be spilled on this occasion than ever before in American history.” Though he served on none of the committees, he was a useful member, his advice being sought on military matters and weight being attached to his advocacy of a nonexportation as well as nonimportation agreement. He also helped to secure approval of the Suffolk Resolves, which looked toward armed resistance as a last resort and did much to harden the king’s heart against America. Returning to Virginia in November, he took command of the volunteer companies drilling there and served as chairman of the Committee of Safety in Fairfax county. Although the province contained many experienced officers and Col. William Byrd of Westover had succeeded Washington as commander in chief, the unanimity with which the Virginia troops turned to Washington was a tribute to his reputation and personality; it was understood that Virginia expected him to be its general. He was elected to the second Continental Congress at the March 1775 session of the legislature and again set out for Philadelphia. Revolutionary leadership Head of the colonial forces The choice of Washington as commander in chief of the military forces of all the colonies followed immediately upon the first fighting, though it was by no means inevitable and was the product of partly artificial forces. The Virginia delegates differed upon his appointment. Edmund Pendleton was, according to John Adams, “very full and clear against it,” and Washington himself recommended Gen. Andrew Lewis for the post. It was chiefly the fruit of a political bargain by which New England offered Virginia the chief command as its price for the adoption and support of the New England army. This army had gathered hastily and in force about Boston immediately after the clash of British troops and American minutemen at Lexington and Concord on April 19, 1775. When the second Continental Congress met in Philadelphia on May 10, one of its first tasks was to find a permanent leadership for this force. On June 15, Washington, whose military counsel had already proved invaluable on two committees, was nominated and chosen by unanimous  George Washington   George Washington vote. Beyond the considerations noted, he owed being chosen to the facts that Virginia stood with Massachusetts as one of the most powerful colonies; that his appointment would augment the zeal of the Southern people; that he had gained an enduring reputation in the Braddock campaign; and that his poise, sense, and resolution had impressed all the delegates. The scene of his election, with Washington darting modestly into an adjoining room and John Hancock flushing with jealous mortification, will always impress the historical imagination; so also will the scene of July 3, 1775, when, wheeling his horse under an elm in front of the troops paraded on Cambridge common, he drew his sword and took command of the army investing Boston. News of Bunker Hill had reached him before he was a day’s journey from Philadelphia, and he had expressed confidence of victory when told how the militia had fought. In accepting the command, he refused any payment beyond his expenses and called upon “every gentleman in the room” to bear witness that he disclaimed fitness for it. At once he showed characteristic decision and energy in organizing the raw volunteers, collecting provisions and munitions, and rallying Congress and the colonies to his support. The first phase of Washington’s command covered the period from July 1775 to the British evacuation of Boston in March 1776. In those eight months he imparted discipline to the army, which at maximum strength slightly exceeded 20,000; he dealt with subordinates who, as John Adams said, quarrelled “like cats and dogs”; and he kept the siege vigorously alive. Having himself planned an invasion of Canada by Lake Champlain, to be entrusted to Gen. Philip Schuyler, he heartily approved of Benedict Arnold’s proposal to march north along the Kennebec River in Maine and take Quebec. Giving Arnold 1,100 men, he instructed him to do everything possible to conciliate the Canadians. He was equally active in encouraging privateers to attack British commerce. As fast as means offered, he strengthened his army with ammunition and siege guns, having heavy artillery brought from Fort Ticonderoga, New York, over the frozen roads early in 1776. His position was at first precarious, for the Charles River pierced the centre of his lines investing Boston. If the British general, Sir William Howe, had moved his 20 veteran regiments boldly up the stream, he might have pierced Washington’s army and rolled either wing back to destruction. But all the generalship was on Washington’s side. Seeing that Dorchester Heights, just south of Boston, commanded the city and harbour and that Howe had unaccountably failed to occupy it, he seized it on the night of March 4, 1776, placing his  George Washington   Charles Willson Peale: George Washington Ticonderoga guns in position. The British naval commander declared that he could not remain if the Americans were not dislodged, and Howe, after a storm disrupted his plans for an assault, evacuated the city on March 17. He left 200 cannons and invaluable stores of small arms and munitions. After collecting his booty, Washington hurried south to take up the defense of New York. Washington had won the first round, but there remained five years of the war, during which the American cause was repeatedly near complete disaster. It is unquestionable that Washington’s strength of character, his ability to hold the confidence of army and people and to diffuse his own courage among them, his unremitting activity, and his strong common sense constituted the chief factors in achieving American victory. He was not a great tactician: as Jefferson said later, he often “failed in the field”; he was sometimes guilty of grave military blunders, the chief being his assumption of a position on Long Island, New York, in 1776 that exposed his entire army to capture the moment it was defeated. At the outset he was painfully inexperienced, the wilderness fighting of the French war having done nothing to teach him the strategy of maneuvering whole armies. One of his chief faults was his tendency to subordinate his own judgment to that of the generals surrounding him; at every critical juncture, before Boston, before New York, before Philadelphia, and in New Jersey, he called a council of war and in almost every instance accepted its decision. Naturally bold and dashing—as he proved at Trenton and Princeton, as well as at Germantown—he repeatedly adopted evasive and delaying tactics on the advice of his associates; however, he did succeed in keeping a strong army in existence and maintaining the flame of national spirit. When the auspicious moment arrived, he planned the rapid movements that ended the war. One element of Washington’s strength was his sternness as a disciplinarian. The army was continually dwindling and refilling, politics largely governed the selection of officers by Congress and the states, and the ill-fed, ill-clothed, ill-paid forces were often half- prostrated by sickness and ripe for mutiny. Troops from each of the three sections, New England, the middle states, and the South, showed a deplorable jealousy of the others. Washington was rigorous in breaking cowardly, inefficient, and dishonest men and boasted in front of Boston that he had “made a pretty good sort of slam among such kind of officers.” Deserters and plunderers were flogged, and Washington once erected a gallows 40 feet (12 metres) high, writing, “I am determined if I can be justified in the proceeding,  George Washington   J.C. Armytage: Retreat at Long Island to hang two or three on it, as an example to others.” At the same time, the commander in chief won the devotion of many of his men by his earnestness in demanding better treatment for them from Congress. He complained of their short rations, declaring once that they were forced to “eat every kind of horse food but hay.” The darkest chapter in Washington’s military leadership was opened when, reaching New York in April 1776, he placed half his army, about 9,000 men, under Israel Putnam, on the perilous position of Brooklyn Heights, Long Island, where a British fleet in the East River might cut off their retreat. He spent a fortnight in May with the Continental Congress in Philadelphia, then discussing the question of independence; though no record of his utterances exists, there can be no doubt that he advocated complete separation. His return to New York preceded but slightly the arrival of the British army under Howe, which made its main encampment on Staten Island until its whole strength of nearly 30,000 could be mobilized. On August 22, 1776, Howe moved about 20,000 men across to Gravesend Bay on Long Island. Four days later, sending the fleet under command of his brother Adm. Richard Howe to make a feint against New York City, he thrust a crushing force along feebly protected roads against the American flank. The patriots were outmaneuvered, defeated, and suffered a total loss of 5,000 men, of whom 2,000 were captured. Their whole position might have been carried by storm, but, fortunately for Washington, General Howe delayed. While the enemy lingered, Washington succeeded under cover of a dense fog in ferrying the remaining force across the East River to Manhattan, where he took up a fortified position. The British, suddenly landing on the lower part of the island, drove back the Americans in a clash marked by disgraceful cowardice on the part of troops from Connecticut and others. In a series of actions, Washington was forced northward, more than once in danger of capture, until the loss of his two Hudson River forts, one of them with 2,600 men, compelled him to retreat from White Plains across the river into New Jersey. He retired toward the Delaware River while his army melted away, until it seemed that armed resistance to the British was about to expire. The Trenton-Princeton campaign It was at this darkest hour of the Revolution that Washington struck his brilliant blows at Trenton and Princeton in New Jersey, reviving the hopes and energies of the nation. Howe,  George Washington   Emanuel Leutze: Washington Crossing the Delaware George Washington believing that the American army soon would dissolve totally, retired to New York, leaving strong forces in Trenton and Burlington. Washington, at his camp west of the Delaware River, planned a simultaneous attack on both posts, using his whole command of 6,000 men. But his subordinates in charge of both wings failed him, and he was left on the night of December 25, 1776, to march on Trenton with about 2,400 men. With the help of Colonel John Glover’s regiment, which was comprised of fishermen and sailors from Marblehead, Massachusetts, Washington and his troops were ferried across the Delaware River. In the dead of night and amid a blinding snowstorm, they then marched 10 miles (16 km) downstream and in the early hours of the morning caught the enemy at Trenton unaware. In less than two hours and without the loss of a single man in battle, Washington’s troops defeated the Hessians, killed their commander (Johann Rall), and captured nearly 1,000 prisoners and arms and ammunition. This historic Christmas crossing proved to be a turning point in the war, and it was immortalized for posterity by Emanuel Gottlieb Leutze in his famous 1851 painting of the event. (The painting is historically inaccurate: the depicted flag is anachronistic, the boats are the wrong size and shape, and it is questionable whether Washington could have crossed the icy Delaware while standing in the manner depicted.) The immediate result of this American victory was that Gen. Charles Cornwallis hastened with about 8,000 men to Trenton, where he found Washington strongly posted behind the Assunpink Creek, skirmished with him, and decided to wait overnight “to bag the old fox.” During the night, the wind shifted, the roads froze hard, and Washington was able to steal away from camp (leaving his fires deceptively burning), march around Cornwallis’s rear, and fall at daybreak upon the three British regiments at Princeton. These were put to flight with a loss of 500 men, and Washington escaped with more captured munitions to a strong position at Morristown, New Jersey. The effect of these victories heartened all Americans, brought recruits flocking to camp in the spring, and encouraged foreign sympathizers with the American cause. Thus far the important successes had been won by Washington; then battlefield success fell to others, while he was left to face popular apathy, military cabals, and the disaffection of  George Washington   Edward Percy Moran: Washington at Valley Forge Congress. The year 1777 was marked by the British capture of Philadelphia and the surrender of British Gen. John Burgoyne’s invading army to Gen. Horatio Gates at Saratoga, New York, followed by intrigues to displace Washington from his command. Howe’s main British army of 18,000 left New York by sea on July 23, 1777, and landed on August 25 in Maryland, not far below Philadelphia. Washington, despite his inferiority of force—he had only 11,000 men, mostly militia and, in the marquis de Lafayette’s words, “badly armed and worse clothed”—risked a pitched battle on September 11 at the fords of Brandywine Creek, about 13 miles (21 km) north of Wilmington, Delaware. While part of the British force held the Americans engaged, General Cornwallis, with the rest, made a secret 17-mile (27-km) detour and fell with crushing effect on the American right and rear, the result being a complete defeat from which Washington was fortunate to extricate his army in fairly good order. For a time he hoped to hold the Schuylkill Fords, but the British passed them and on September 26 triumphantly marched into Philadelphia. Congress fled to the interior of Pennsylvania, and Washington, after an unsuccessful effort to repeat his stroke at Trenton against the British troops posted at Germantown, had to take up winter quarters at Valley Forge. His army, twice beaten, ill housed, and ill fed, with thousands of men “barefoot and otherwise naked,” was at the point of exhaustion; it could not keep the field, for inside of a month it would have disappeared. Under these circumstances, there is nothing that better proves the true fibre of Washington’s character and the courage of his soul than the unyielding persistence with which he held his strong position at Valley Forge through a winter of semistarvation, of justified grumbling by his men, of harsh public criticism, and of captious meddling by a Congress that was too weak to help him. In February Martha Washington arrived and helped to organize entertainment for the soldiers. Washington’s enemies seized the moment of his greatest weakness to give vent to an antagonism that had been nourished by sectional jealousies of North against South, by the ambition of small rivals, and by baseless accusations that he showed favouritism to such foreigners as Lafayette. The intrigues of Thomas Conway, an Irish adventurer who had served in the French army and had become an American general, enlisted Thomas Mifflin, Charles Lee, Benjamin Rush, and others in an attempt to displace Washington. General Gates appears to have been a tool of rather than a party to the plot, expecting that the chief command would devolve upon himself. A faction of Congress sympathized with the  George Washington   George Washington at the Battle of Monmouth movement and attempted to paralyze Washington by reorganizing the board of war, a body vested with the general superintendence of operations, of which Gates became the president; his chief of staff, James Wilkinson, the secretary; and Mifflin and Timothy Pickering, members. Washington was well aware of the hostility in congress, of the slanders spread by Rush and James Lovell of Massachusetts, and of the effect of forgeries published in the American press by adroit British agents. He realized the intense jealousy of many New Englanders, which made even John Adams write his wife that he was thankful Burgoyne had not been captured by Washington, who would then “have been deified. It is bad enough as it is.” But Washington decisively crushed the cabal: after the loose tongue of Wilkinson disclosed Conway’s treachery, Washington sent the general on November 9, 1777, proof of his knowledge of the whole affair. With the conclusion of the French alliance in the spring of 1778, the aspect of the war was radically altered. The British army in Philadelphia, fearing that a French fleet would blockade the Delaware while the militia of New Jersey and Pennsylvania invested the city, hastily retreated upon New York City. Washington hoped to cut off part of the enemy and by a hurried march with six brigades interposed himself at the end of June between Sir Henry Clinton (who had succeeded Howe) and the New Jersey coast. The result was the Battle of Monmouth on June 28, where a shrewd strategic plan and vigorous assault were brought to naught by the treachery of Charles Lee. When Lee ruined the attack by a sudden order to retreat, Washington hurried forward, fiercely denounced him, and restored the line, but the golden opportunity had been lost. The British made good their march to Sandy Hook, and Washington took up his quarters at New Brunswick. Lee was arrested, court-martialed, and convicted on all three of the charges made against him; but instead of being shot, as he deserved, he was sentenced to a suspension from command for one year. The arrival of the French fleet under Adm. Charles-Hector Estaing on July 1778 completed the isolation of the British, and Clinton was thenceforth held to New York City and the surrounding area. Washington made his headquarters in the highlands of the Hudson and distributed his troops in cantonments around the city and in New Jersey. The final decisive stroke of the war, the capture of Cornwallis at Yorktown, is to be credited chiefly to Washington’s vision. With the domestic situation intensely gloomy early in 1781, he was hampered by the feebleness of Congress, the popular discouragement, and  George Washington   Surrender of Cornwallis George Washington: resigning commission Currier & Ives: Washington Taking Leave of the Officers of His Army the lack of prompt and strong support by the French fleet. A French army under the comte de Rochambeau had arrived to reinforce him in 1780, and Washington had pressed Admiral de Grasse to assist in an attack upon either Cornwallis in the south or Clinton in New York. In August the French admiral sent definite word that he preferred the Chesapeake, with its large area and deep water, as the scene of his operations; and within a week, on August 19, 1781, Washington marched south with his army, leaving Gen. William Heath with 4,000 men to hold West Point. He hurried his troops through New Jersey, embarked them on transports in Delaware Bay, and landed them at Williamsburg, Virginia, where he had arrived on September 14. Cornwallis had retreated to Yorktown and entrenched his army of 7,000 British regulars. Their works were completely invested before the end of the month; the siege was pressed with vigour by the allied armies under Washington, consisting of 5,500 Continentals, 3,500 Virginia militia, and 5,000 French regulars; and on October 19 Cornwallis surrendered. By this campaign, probably the finest single display of Washington’s generalship, the war was brought to a virtual close. Washington remained during the winter of 1781–82 with the Continental Congress in Philadelphia, exhorting it to maintain its exertions for liberty and to settle the army’s claims for pay. He continued these exhortations after he joined his command at Newburgh on the Hudson in April 1782. He was astounded and angered when some loose camp suggestions found expression in a letter from Col. Lewis Nicola offering a plan by which he should use the army to make himself king. He blasted the proposal with fierce condemnation. When the discontent of his unpaid men came to a head in the circulation of the “Newburgh Address” (an anonymously written grievance) early in 1783, he issued a general order censuring the paper and at a meeting of officers on March 15 read a speech admonishing the army to obey Congress and promising his best efforts for a redress of grievances. He was present at the entrance of the American army into New York on the day of the British evacuation, November 25, 1783,  George Washington   Jean-Antoine Houdon: George Washington and on December 4 took leave of his closest officers in an affecting scene at Fraunces Tavern. Traveling south, on December 23, in a solemn ceremonial immortalized by the pen of William Makepeace Thackeray, he resigned his commission to the Continental Congress in the state senate chamber of Maryland in Annapolis and received the thanks of the nation. His accounts of personal expenditures during his service, kept with minute exactness in his own handwriting and totalling £24,700, without charge for salary, had been given the controller of the treasury to be discharged. Washington left Annapolis at sunrise of December 24 and before nightfall was at home in Mount Vernon. In the next four years Washington found sufficient occupation in his estates, wishing to close his days as a gentleman farmer and to give to agriculture as much energy and thought as he had to the army. He enlarged the Mount Vernon house; he laid out the grounds anew, with sunken walls, or ha-has; and he embarked on experiments with mahogany, palmetto, pepper, and other foreign trees, and English grasses and grains. His farm manager during the Revolution, a distant relative named Lund Washington, retired in 1785 and was succeeded by a nephew, Maj. George Augustine Washington, who resided at Mount Vernon until his death in 1792. Washington’s losses during the war had been heavy, caused by neglect of his lands, stoppage of exportation, and depreciation of paper money, which cost him hardly less than $30,000. He then attempted successfully to repair his fortunes, his annual receipts from all his estates being from $10,000 to $15,000 a year. In 1784 he made a tour of nearly 700 miles (1,125 km) to view the wildlands he owned to the westward, Congress having made him a generous grant. As a national figure, he was constrained to offer hospitality to old army friends, visitors from other states and nations, diplomats, and Indian delegations, and he and his household seldom sat down to dinner alone. Presidency Postrevolutionary politics Viewing the chaotic political condition of the United States after 1783 with frank pessimism and declaring (May 18, 1786) that “something must be done, or the fabric must fall, for it is certainly tottering,” Washington repeatedly wrote his friends urging steps toward “an indissoluble union.” At first he believed that the Articles of Confederation might be amended. Later, especially after the shock of Shays’s Rebellion, he took the view that a more radical reform was necessary but doubted as late as the end of  George Washington   1786 that the time was ripe. His progress toward adoption of the idea of a federal convention was, in fact, puzzlingly slow. Although John Jay assured him in March 1786 that breakup of the nation seemed near and opinion for a constitutional convention was crystallizing, Washington remained noncommittal. But, despite long hesitations, he earnestly supported the proposal for a federal impost, warning the states that their policy must decide “whether the Revolution must ultimately be considered a blessing or a curse.” And his numerous letters to the leading men of the country assisted greatly to form a sentiment favourable to a more perfect union. Some understanding being necessary between Virginia and Maryland regarding the navigation of the Potomac, commissioners from the two states had met at Mount Vernon in the spring of 1785; from this seed sprang the federal convention. Washington approved in advance the call for a gathering of all the states to meet in Philadelphia in May 1787 to “render the Constitution of the Federal Government adequate to the exigencies of the Union.” But he was again hesitant about attending, partly because he felt tired and infirm, partly because of doubts about the outcome. Although he hoped to the last to be excused, he was chosen one of Virginia’s five delegates. Washington arrived in Philadelphia on May 13, the day before the opening of the Constitutional Convention, and as soon as a quorum was obtained he was unanimously chosen its president. For four months he presided over the convention, breaking his silence only once upon a minor question of congressional apportionment. Although he said little in debate, no one did more outside the hall to insist on stern measures. “My wish is,” he wrote, “that the convention may adopt no temporizing expedients, but probe the defects of the Constitution to the bottom, and provide a radical cure.” His weight of character did more than any other single force to bring the convention to an agreement and obtain ratification of the instrument afterward. He did not believe it perfect, though his precise criticisms of it are unknown. But his support gave it victory in Virginia, where he sent copies to Patrick Henry and other leaders with a hint that the alternative to adoption was anarchy, declaring that “it or dis-union is before us to chuse from.” He received and personally circulated copies of The Federalist. When ratification was obtained, he wrote to leaders in the various states urging that men staunchly favourable to it be elected to Congress. For a time he sincerely believed that, the new framework completed, he would be allowed to retire again to privacy. But all eyes immediately turned to him for the first president. He alone commanded the respect of both the parties engendered by the struggle over ratification, and he alone would be able to give prestige to the republic throughout Europe. In no state was any other name considered. The electors chosen in the first days of  George Washington   Washington delivering his inaugural address 1789 cast a unanimous vote for him, and reluctantly—for his love of peace, his distrust of his own abilities, and his fear that his motives in advocating the new government might be misconstrued all made him unwilling—he accepted. On April 16, after receiving congressional notification of the honour, he set out from Mount Vernon, reaching New York City in time to be inaugurated on April 30 (see primary source document: First Inaugural Address). His journey northward was a celebratory procession as people in every town and village through which he passed turned out to greet him, often with banners and speeches, and in some places with triumphal arches. He came across the Hudson River in a specially built barge decorated in red, white, and blue. The inaugural ceremony was performed on Wall Street, near the spot now marked by John Quincy Adams Ward’s statue of Washington. A great crowd broke into cheers as, standing on the balcony of Federal Hall, he took the oath administered by Chancellor Robert Livingston and retired indoors to read Congress his inaugural address. Washington was clad in a brown suit of American manufacture, but he wore white stockings and a sword after the fashion of European courts. Martha was as reluctant as her husband to resume public life. But a month later she came from Mount Vernon to join him. She, too, was greeted wildly on her way. And when Washington crossed the Hudson to bring her to Manhattan, guns boomed in salute. The Washingtons, to considerable public criticism, traveled about in a coach-and-four like monarchs. Moreover, during his presidency, Washington did not shake hands, and he met his guests on state occasions while standing on a raised platform and displaying a sword on his hip. Slowly, feeling his way, Washington was defining the style of the first president of a country in the history of the world. The people, too, were adjusting to a government without a king. Even the question of how to address a president had to be discussed. It was decided that in a republic the simple salutation “Mr. President” would do. The Washington administration Washington’s administration of the government in the next eight years was marked by the caution, the methodical precision, and the sober judgment that had always characterized him. He regarded himself as standing aloof from party divisions and emphasized his position as president of the whole country by touring first through the Northern states and  George Washington   Gilbert Stuart: portrait of George Washington later through the Southern. A painstaking inquiry into all the problems confronting the new nation laid the basis for a series of judicious recommendations to Congress in his first message. In selecting the four members of his first cabinet—Thomas Jefferson as secretary of state, Alexander Hamilton as secretary of treasury, Henry Knox as secretary of war, and Edmund Randolph as attorney general—Washington balanced the two parties evenly. But he leaned with especial weight upon Hamilton, who supported his scheme for the federal assumption of state debts, took his view that the bill establishing the Bank of the United States was constitutional, and in general favoured strengthening the authority of the federal government. Distressed when the inevitable clash between Jefferson and Hamilton arose, he tried to keep harmony, writing frankly to each and refusing to accept their resignations. But when war was declared between France and England in 1793, he took Hamilton’s view that the United States should completely disregard the treaty of alliance with France and pursue a course of strict neutrality, while he acted decisively to stop the improper operations of the French minister, Edmond-Charles Genêt. He had a firm belief that the United States must insist on its national identity, strength, and dignity. His object, he wrote, was to keep the country “free from political connections with every other country, to see them independent of all, and under the influence of none. In a word, I want an American character that the powers of Europe may be convinced that we act for ourselves, and not for others.” The sequel was the resignation of Jefferson at the close of 1793, the two men parting on good terms and Washington praising Jefferson’s “integrity and talents.” The suppression of the Whiskey Rebellion in 1794 by federal troops whom Hamilton led in person and the dispatch of John Jay to conclude a treaty of commerce with Great Britain tended further to align Washington with the federalists. Although the general voice of the people compelled him to acquiesce reluctantly to a second term in 1792 and his election that year was again unanimous, during his last four years in office he suffered from a fierce personal and partisan animosity. This culminated when the publication of the terms of the Jay Treaty, which Washington signed in August 1795, provoked a bitter discussion, and the House of Representatives called upon the president for the instructions and correspondence relating to the treaty. These Washington, who had already clashed with the Senate on foreign affairs, refused to deliver, and, in the face of an acrimonious debate, he firmly maintained his position. George Washington   Washington's Farewell Address George Washington on Mount Rushmore Early in his first term, Washington, who by education and natural inclination was minutely careful of the proprieties of life, established the rules of a virtual republican court. In both New York and Philadelphia he rented the best houses procurable, refusing to accept the hospitality of George Clinton, for he believed the head of the nation should be no man’s guest. He returned no calls and shook hands with no one, acknowledging salutations by a formal bow. He drove in a coach drawn by four or six smart horses, with outriders and lackeys in rich livery. He attended receptions dressed in a black velvet suit with gold buckles, with yellow gloves, powdered hair, a cocked hat with an ostrich plume in one hand, and a sword in a white leather scabbard. After being overwhelmed by callers, he announced that, except for a weekly levee open to all, persons desiring to see him had to make appointments in advance. On Friday afternoons the first lady held informal receptions, at which the president appeared. Although the presidents of the Continental Congress had made their tables partly public, Washington, who entertained largely, inviting members of Congress in rotation, insisted that his hospitality be private. He served good wines and the menus were elaborate, but such visitors as Pennsylvania Sen. William Maclay complained that the atmosphere was too “solemn.” Indeed, his simple ceremony offended many of the more radical anti-federalists, who did not share his sense of its fitness and accused the president of conducting himself like a king. But his cold and reserved manner was caused by native diffidence rather than any excessive sense of dignity. Retirement Earnestly desiring leisure, feeling a decline of his physical powers, and wincing under abuses of the opposition, Washington refused to yield to the general pressure for a third term. This refusal was blended with a testament of sagacious advice to his country in the Farewell Address (see original text) of September 19, 1796, written largely by Hamilton but remolded by Washington and expressing his ideas. Retiring in March 1797 to Mount Vernon, he devoted himself for the last two and a half years of his life to his family, farm operations, and care of his slaves. In 1798 his seclusion was briefly interrupted when the prospect of war with France caused his appointment as commander in chief of the provisional army, and he was much worried by the political quarrels over high commissions; but the war cloud passed away. George Washington   George Washington: death George Washington: death procession On December 12, 1799, after riding on horseback for several hours in cold and snow, he returned home exhausted and was attacked late the next day with quinsy or acute laryngitis. He was bled heavily four times and given gargles of “molasses, vinegar and butter,” and a blister of cantharides (a preparation of dried beetles) was placed on his throat, his strength meanwhile rapidly sinking. He faced the end with characteristic serenity, saying, “I die hard, but I am not afraid to go,” and later: “I feel myself going. I thank you for your attentions; but I pray you to take no more trouble about me. Let me go off quietly. I cannot last long.” After giving instructions to his secretary, Tobias Lear, about his burial, he died at 10:00 PM on December 14. The news of his death placed the entire country in mourning, and the sentiment of the country endorsed the famous words of Henry (“Light-Horse Harry”) Lee, embodied in resolutions that John Marshall introduced in the House of Representatives, that he was “first in war, first in peace, and first in the hearts of his countrymen.” When the news reached Europe, the British channel fleet and the armies of Napoleon paid tribute to his memory, and many of the leaders of the time joined in according him a preeminent place among the heroes of history. His fellow citizens memorialized him forever by naming the newly created capital city of the young nation for him while he was still alive. Later, one of the states of union would bear his name—the only state named for an individual American. Moreover, counties in 32 states were given his name, and in time it also could be found in 121 postal addresses. The people of the United States have continued to glory in knowing him as “the Father of His Country,” an accolade he was pleased to accept, even though it pained him that he fathered no children of his own. For almost a century beginning in the 1770s, Washington was the uncontested giant in the American pantheon of greats, but only until Abraham Lincoln was enshrined there after another critical epoch in the life of the country.

2008, Amman, Jordan), militant Palestinian and leader of the Popular Front for the
Liberation of Palestine (PFLP).
Ḥabash was forced to flee Palestine in 1948, after the State of Israel was established there,
and earned a medical degree at the American University of Beirut. In the early 1950s he
was active in the “Youth of Vengeance” group, which advocated violent attacks on
traditional Arab governments. Ḥabash founded the militant PFLP after his goal to liberate
Palestine through Arab unity proved unrealistic following the Arab defeat by Israel in the
Six-Day War of 1967 (see Arab-Israeli wars). Under the leadership of Ḥabash, the PFLP
staged several airplane hijackings, including the abduction of three Western passenger jets
to a Jordanian airstrip in September 1970. These activities destabilized the Jordanian
monarchy and triggered King Ḥussein’s crackdown on Palestinian guerrillas operating in
Jordan. A bloody civil war followed, in which the PFLP and other guerrillas were driven
from the country.
Ḥabash, a Marxist, visited China in 1970 (where Chinese leaders criticized the PFLP’s
“foreign operations”) and Moscow in 1972. Following the Yom Kippur War of 1973,
Ḥabash became the leading voice of the “Rejection Front,” four Palestinian groups that
opposed any diplomatic settlement to the conflict with Israel. He attacked what he called
the “defeatist” attitude of the Palestine Liberation Organization’s leadership, whose
attempts at reconciliation with King Ḥussein he sharply criticized. Under his leadership the
PFLP successfully organized clandestine cells in the Israeli-occupied West Bank and Gaza
Strip. Ḥabash stepped down as leader of the PLFP in 2000.

revolutionary leader and writer, an early and influential partisan of Bulgarian liberation
from Ottoman Turkish rule.
Already a national revolutionary by the age of 16, he participated in an insurrection against
the Turks in 1841. Later, as an employee of the Turkish war ministry during the Crimean
War (1853–56), he secretly organized an armed revolt in Bulgaria. Arrested and sentenced
to death, he escaped abroad to Serbia, Romania, and Russia, where he sought European
support for Bulgarian liberation and published journals. He addressed his revolutionary
appeals to his Bulgarian countrymen. Though his radical, violent schemes cost him
conservative support, his leadership gave the first real impetus to the Bulgarian
independence movement, and his journalistic and literary work especially won young
Bulgarians to the national cause. His diplomatic efforts made the Bulgarian problem better
known in the European capitals. He organized a “Bulgarian Legion” of volunteers in
Belgrade and later in Bucharest that was intended to form the core of a future Bulgarian
army. The legion supported the Serbs against the Ottoman Empire in the skirmishes of
1862.

Georgios Grivas, in full Georgios Theodoros Grivas, also called Dighenis, (born May
23, 1898, Trikomo, Cyprus—died Jan. 27, 1974, Limassol), Cypriot patriot who helped
bring Cyprus independence in 1960. His goal was enosis (union) with Greece, and in this
he failed; indeed, he was a fugitive at the time of his death.
Grivas organized EOKA (Ethnikí Orgánosis Kipriakoú Agónos, the “National Organization
of Cypriot Struggle”) about 1955, after leading a right-wing resistance group in the Athens
area during the German occupation of World War II. With his friend, afterward his enemy,
the Orthodox cleric Makarios III, Grivas conducted a guerrilla war against the British that
led to the independence of Cyprus but not to the enosis that was always his objective.
Grivas, who had been serving as commander of the Greek Cypriot National Guard, was
recalled by the Greek government in 1967 following clashes between the National Guard
and Turkish Cypriots near Larnarca. In 1971 he returned to Cyprus to revitalize the
underground movement against Makarios (then president of Cyprus). On his death, his
followers vowed to continue his armed campaign for enosis.

Gino, Marquess Capponi
Gino, Marquess Capponi, (born Sept. 13, 1792, Florence [Italy]—died Feb. 3, 1876,
Florence), historian, statesman, and leader of liberalism in Tuscany who played an
extremely influential role in the rise of the Risorgimento. His salon in Florence was long a
centre for the leading liberal thinkers of Europe.
Capponi founded two periodicals, L’Antologia (1821; “Anthology”), which was modeled
after the Edinburgh Review, and Archivio storico italiano (1839; “Italian Historical
Review”). Although he was completely blind by 1840, he continued to lead an active
political life, striving for the liberal government that he had so long envisioned. King
Leopold II of Tuscany regarded him so highly that he appointed him, successively,
counselor of state (1847) and minister of state (1848). After a long and successful battle to
gain a liberal constitution from Leopold, Capponi served as senator in the Tuscan Assembly
(1859), and he was nominated senator of the newly created kingdom of Italy in 1860
following the annexation of Tuscany that year by King Victor Emmanuel II of Sardinia-
Piedmont. His failing health, however, prevented him from taking his seat in the Senate,
and Capponi spent his last years writing his great work, Storia della repubblica di Firenze
(1875; “History of the Republic of Florence”).

Giuseppe Garibaldi
Giuseppe Garibaldi
Giuseppe Garibaldi, (born July 4, 1807, Nice,
French Empire [now in France]—died June 2, 1882,
Caprera, Italy), Italian patriot and soldier of the
Risorgimento, a republican who, through his conquest
of Sicily and Naples with his guerrilla Redshirts,
contributed to the achievement of Italian unification
under the royal house of Savoy.
Early life
Garibaldi’s family was one of fishermen and coastal traders, and for more than 10 years he
himself was a sailor. In 1832 he acquired a master’s certificate as a merchant captain. By
1833–34, when he served in the navy of the kingdom of Piedmont-Sardinia, he had come
under the influence of Giuseppe Mazzini, the great prophet of Italian nationalism, and the
French socialist thinker the comte de Saint-Simon. Garibaldi, in 1834, took part in a mutiny
intended to provoke a republican revolution in Piedmont, but the plot failed; he escaped to
France and in his absence was condemned to death by a Genoese court.
Exile in South America
From 1836 to 1848, Garibaldi lived in South America as an exile, and these years of
turmoil and revolution in that continent strongly influenced his career. He volunteered as a
naval captain for the Rio Grande do Sul republic during that small state’s unsuccessful
attempt to break free from the Brazilian Empire. Actually, he did little more than prey on
Brazilian shipping. In the course of often harrowing adventures on land and sea, he
managed to elope with Anna Maria Ribeiro da Silva (Anita), a married woman, who
remained his companion in arms until her death. After a succession of victories by the
Brazilians in 1839–40, Garibaldi finally decided to leave the service of Rio Grande.
Driving a herd of cattle, he made the long trek to Montevideo with Anita and their son.
There he tried his hand as commercial traveler and teacher but could not accustom himself
to civilian life. In 1842 he was put in charge of the Uruguayan navy in another war of
liberation—this time against Juan Manuel de Rosas, the dictator of Argentina. The
following year, again in the service of Uruguay, Garibaldi took command of a newly
formed Italian Legion at Montevideo, the first of the Redshirts, with whom his name
became so closely associated. After he won a small but heroic engagement at the Battle of

Sant’Antonio in 1846, his fame reached even to Europe, and in Italy a sword of honour,
paid for by subscriptions, was donated to him.
He was in charge of the defense of Montevideo for a short time in 1847, when he first came
to the attention of Alexandre Dumas père, who later did much to foster his reputation.
Garibaldi also greatly impressed other foreign observers as an honest and able man. His
South American experiences gave him invaluable training in the techniques of guerrilla
warfare that he later used with great effect against French and Austrian armies, which had
not been taught how to counter them. These first exploits in the cause of freedom cast him
in the mold of a professional rebel, an indomitable individualist who all his life continued
to wear the gaucho costume of the pampas and to act as if life were a perpetual battle for
liberty.
War of liberation
In April 1848 Garibaldi led 60 members of his Italian Legion back to Italy to fight for the
Risorgimento, or resurrection, of Italy in the war of independence against the Austrians. He
first offered to fight for Pope Pius IX, then—when his offer was refused—for Charles
Albert, the king of Piedmont-Sardinia. The king, too, rebuffed him, for Garibaldi’s
conviction as a rebel in 1834 was still remembered; moreover, the regular army despised
the self-taught guerrilla leader. Therefore, Garibaldi went to the aid of the city of Milan,
where Mazzini had already arrived and had given the war of liberation a more republican
and radical turn. Charles Albert, after his defeat at the hands of the Austrians at Custoza,
agreed to an armistice, but Garibaldi continued in the name of Milan what had become his
private war and emerged creditably from two engagements with the Austrians at Luino and
Morazzone. But at the end of August, heavily outnumbered, he had to retreat across the
frontier to Switzerland.
For a time Garibaldi settled down in Nice with Anita (whom he had married in 1842) and
their three children, but his resolve to help free Italy from foreign rule was stronger than
ever. He was confirmed in his purpose by his belief—which he and only a handful of others
shared with Mazzini—that the many Italian states, though often engaged in internecine
warfare, could nonetheless be unified into a single state. When Pius IX, threatened by
liberal forces within the Papal States, fled from Rome toward the end of 1848, Garibaldi
led a group of volunteers to that city. There, in February 1849, he was elected a deputy in
the Roman Assembly, and it was he who proposed that Rome should become an
independent republic. In April a French army arrived to restore papal government, and
Garibaldi was the chief inspiration of a spirited defense that repulsed a French attack on the

Janiculum Hill. In May he defeated a Neapolitan army outside Rome at Velletri, and in
June he was the leading figure in the defense of Rome against a French siege. There was no
chance at all of holding the city, but the gallantry of the resistance became one of the most
inspiring stories of the Risorgimento. Refusing to accept defeat, Garibaldi led a few
thousand men out of Rome and through central Italy in July 1849, maneuvering to avoid
French and Austrian armies, until he reached the neutral republic of San Marino.
Retreat
There Garibaldi found himself surrounded and decided to disband his men. Soon afterward,
he was pursued by the Austrians as he tried to escape. Although Anita died, Garibaldi
successfully crossed the Apennines to the Tuscan coast. The retreat through central Italy,
coming after the defense of Rome, made Garibaldi a well-known figure. From then on he
was the “hero of two worlds.” Some criticized his military skill in this campaign, but his
qualities as a leader had proved to be extraordinary, and his courage and determination not
to surrender were a lesson in patriotism for his fellow countrymen.
The Piedmontese monarchy, however, was too frightened to let this rebel return to his
mother and children, and soon he was in exile again, first in Tangier, then on Staten Island,
and finally in Peru, where he returned to his original trade as a ship’s captain. Only in 1854
was he allowed to return to Italy. The conte di Cavour, the prime minister of Piedmont,
believed that by permitting Garibaldi’s repatriation he could pry him away from the
republican Mazzini. In the following year, Garibaldi bought part of the island of Caprera
off the Sardinian coast, which remained his home for the rest of his life. In 1856 he tried to
lead an expedition to release political prisoners held by the Bourbon kings of Naples, but it
came to nothing. In 1858 he received an invitation from Cavour to help prepare for another
war against Austria. His task was to lead an army of volunteers from other Italian
provinces, and he was given the rank of major general in the Piedmontese army. When war
broke out in April 1859, he led his Cacciatori delle Alpi (Alpine Huntsmen) in the capture
of Varese and Como and reached the frontier of the south Tirol. This war ended with the
acquisition of Lombardy by Piedmont.
In September 1859, after peace had returned to northern Italy, Garibaldi transferred his
attention to central Italy, where a revolutionary government had been established in
Florence. There, on several occasions, he had private meetings with King Victor Emmanuel
II of Piedmont-Sardinia, and it was agreed that he should prepare to invade the Papal
States; the king would support his venture if it succeeded but disown him if it failed. At the
last moment, however, the king realized that the undertaking was too dangerous and asked

him to give up the idea. Garibaldi agreed, though reluctantly. He was ready at any moment
to revive this kind of unwritten agreement with Victor Emmanuel, but it became
increasingly clear that their aims were not identical. Though both men were patriots,
Garibaldi was already working for the unification of Italy. The king was more prudent,
concerned foremost with expanding Piedmont. Garibaldi was especially furious when,
early in 1860, Cavour and Victor Emmanuel gave his hometown of Nice back to France (it
had become Piedmontese in 1814), and he made one of his rare appearances in parliament
to protest this violation of the national principle. In January 1860 he married Giuseppina,
the daughter of the Marchese Raimondi, but abandoned her, within hours of the marriage,
when he discovered she was five months pregnant, almost certainly by one of his own
officers. Twenty years later, he was able to obtain the decree of nullity that enabled him to
legitimize his children by Francesca Armosino, his longtime companion.
Conquest of Sicily and Naples
In May 1860 Garibaldi set out on the greatest venture
of his life, the conquest of Sicily and Naples. This
time he had no government backing, but Cavour and
Victor Emmanuel did not dare to stop him, for he had
become a popular hero. They stood ready to assist,
but only if he proved successful, and he accepted this
unwritten arrangement, confident that he could thus
force Cavour to support a new move toward the
unification of the Italian peninsula. Sailing from near
Genoa on May 6 with about 1,000 men, he reached
Marsala in Sicily on May 11 and in the name of
Victor Emmanuel proclaimed himself dictator. A
popular revolution in Sicily helped him considerably, for his personal charm was
irresistible, and many of the peasants thought him a god intent on freeing them from
slavery and feudalism. The decisive moment for his forces was a small engagement at
Calatafimi, when he gave convincing proof that he could defeat the regular soldiers of the
king of Naples’s army. Immediately there was a great popular movement in his support,
and at the end of May he captured Palermo.
The seizure of Palermo was one of Garibaldi’s most remarkable military successes, and it
convinced Cavour that this volunteer army should now be strongly, if still secretly,
supported by Piedmont. Moving across the island, Garibaldi won the Battle of Milazzo in
July, helped by reinforcements from northern Italy. In August he crossed over the Strait of

Messina and landed on the mainland in Calabria. As always, his strategy was to deny the
enemy a moment’s pause. After a lightning campaign, he moved up through Calabria and
on September 7, 1860, entered Naples, Italy’s largest city, where he proclaimed himself
“Dictator of the Two Sicilies” (the name of the territories of the king of Naples, comprising
Sicily and most of southern Italy).
With 30,000 men under his command, he then fought the biggest battle of his career, on the
Volturno River north of Naples. After his victory, he held plebiscites in Sicily and Naples,
which allowed him to hand over the whole of southern Italy to King Victor Emmanuel.
When the two met, Garibaldi was the first person to hail Victor Emmanuel as king of a
united Italy. The king made a triumphal entry into Naples on November 7, and Garibaldi
sat beside him in the royal carriage. But immediately afterward the former dictator returned
to Caprera, refusing all the rewards thrust on him. He had asked for only one thing—to be
allowed to continue governing Naples as the king’s viceroy until conditions returned to
normal; but this was refused him, for in the eyes of the conservatives he was still a
dangerous radical—an anticlerical who also professed to hold advanced ideas on social
reform. He was also a man who was known to want to reconquer Rome from the pope and
make it into Italy’s capital. This was too dangerous a scheme for Victor Emmanuel, for a
French garrison defended papal temporal power in Rome. There was also another, more
insidious danger: Garibaldi was more popular than the king himself. Furthermore, the
regular army of Piedmont was deeply jealous of his successes and determined that he
should not be permitted to score fresh ones. Finally, it was feared that Mazzini and the
republicans might recapture Garibaldi’s allegiance and make him desert the monarchical
cause.
Kingdom of Italy
In 1861 a new kingdom of Italy came into existence,
but from the start it found Garibaldi virtually in
opposition. Many people regarded him as an
embarrassment. He opposed Cavour in parliament
and accused the government of shabby treatment of
the volunteer soldiers who had conquered half the
country and given it to the king. Moreover, he
condemned the inefficient administration of the provinces that he had conquered and for
which he felt especially responsible. In many ways he showed that he considered himself
almost an independent power, both in his dealings with his own government and with
foreign powers. So admired abroad was Garibaldi that in July 1861 U.S. President

Abraham Lincoln offered him a Union command in the American Civil War; the offer was
declined, partly because Lincoln would not make a sweeping enough condemnation of
slavery, but also because he would not give Garibaldi supreme command of the Federal
troops. Another sign of Garibaldi’s reputation was the rapturous reception that he received
in England in April 1864. Perhaps never before in history had there been such a large
spontaneous gathering as the one that cheered him through the streets of London.
Last campaigns
Early in 1862 Victor Emmanuel again persuaded Garibaldi to lead a revolutionary
expedition, this time to attack Austria in the Balkans. He was allowed to recruit another
volunteer army, and munitions were collected for him in Sicily; but he then decided to use
this army to attack the Papal States. Not wanting to jeopardize its relations with the French,
the Italian government ordered its own forces to stop Garibaldi. At the ensuing Battle of
Aspromonte, he was badly wounded and taken prisoner. When he was freed, however, the
king’s complicity could no longer be denied. Garibaldi’s wound left him lame, but this did
not prevent the government from using him more openly when war broke out with Austria
in 1866. He was given an almost independent command in the Tirol, and once again he
emerged from the war with a good deal more credit than any of the regular soldiers. This
conflict led to the acquisition of Venice. In 1867 Garibaldi led another private expedition
into the Papal States. This, too, was secretly subsidized by the government, though, of
course, the king pretended otherwise; but political mismanagement of the whole incident
forced France to intervene, and French troops defeated Garibaldi’s volunteers at Mentana.
Once more he was arrested by the Italian government to cover up its complicity, but he was
soon released and taken back to Caprera. Garibaldi led one final campaign in 1870–71,
when he assisted the French Republic against Prussia. Again he distinguished himself,
though on a small scale, and he was subsequently elected a member of the French National
Assembly at Bordeaux.
During the last decade of his life he was crippled by rheumatism and by his many wounds.
Though he had become something of a recluse on his island, he kept abreast of affairs
through the numerous deputations that called on him, and he habitually made
pronouncements on affairs of the day. Toward the end he called himself a socialist, but both
Karl Marx and the anarchist Mikhail Bakunin disowned him. He also became something of
a pacifist, for his own experience had taught him that wars were seldom either righteous or
effective in achieving their ends. Garibaldi was recognized as a champion of the rights of
labour and of women’s emancipation. Moreover, he showed himself to be a religious

freethinker and ahead of his time in believing in racial equality and the abolition of capital
punishment.
Legacy
One of the great masters of guerrilla warfare, Garibaldi was responsible for most of the
military victories of the Risorgimento. Almost equally important was his contribution as a
propagandist to the unification of Italy. A man of the people, he knew far better than
Cavour or Mazzini how to reach the masses with the new message of patriotism.
Furthermore, his use of his military and political gifts for liberal or nationalist causes
coincided well with current fashion and brought him great acclaim. In addition, he attracted
support by being a truly honest man who asked little for himself.
But Garibaldi’s forthright innocence coloured his politics. Not interested in power for
himself, he nevertheless believed in dictatorship as a result of his South American
experiences. He distrusted parliaments because he saw them to be ineffective and corrupt.
Actually, his own dictatorship of southern Italy in 1860, though much criticized, compares
surprisingly well with the subsequent administration by the Kingdom of Italy. There was
little of the intellectual about Garibaldi, yet his simple radicalism sparked the first political
awareness in many of his fellow countrymen and brought home to them the significance of
nationality. Notwithstanding his turn toward socialism, he remained primarily a nationalist
—but the object of his nationalism was always the liberation of peoples and not patriotic
aggrandizement. To his embodiment of this aim he owes his eminent place in Italian
history.

Early life Garibaldi’s family was one of fishermen and coastal traders, and for more than 10 years he himself was a sailor. In 1832 he acquired a master’s certificate as a merchant captain. By 1833–34, when he served in the navy of the kingdom of Piedmont-Sardinia, he had come under the influence of Giuseppe Mazzini, the great prophet of Italian nationalism, and the French socialist thinker the comte de Saint-Simon. Garibaldi, in 1834, took part in a mutiny intended to provoke a republican revolution in Piedmont, but the plot failed; he escaped to France and in his absence was condemned to death by a Genoese court. Exile in South America From 1836 to 1848, Garibaldi lived in South America as an exile, and these years of turmoil and revolution in that continent strongly influenced his career. He volunteered as a naval captain for the Rio Grande do Sul republic during that small state’s unsuccessful attempt to break free from the Brazilian Empire. Actually, he did little more than prey on Brazilian shipping. In the course of often harrowing adventures on land and sea, he managed to elope with Anna Maria Ribeiro da Silva (Anita), a married woman, who remained his companion in arms until her death. After a succession of victories by the Brazilians in 1839–40, Garibaldi finally decided to leave the service of Rio Grande. Driving a herd of cattle, he made the long trek to Montevideo with Anita and their son. There he tried his hand as commercial traveler and teacher but could not accustom himself to civilian life. In 1842 he was put in charge of the Uruguayan navy in another war of liberation—this time against Juan Manuel de Rosas, the dictator of Argentina. The following year, again in the service of Uruguay, Garibaldi took command of a newly formed Italian Legion at Montevideo, the first of the Redshirts, with whom his name became so closely associated. After he won a small but heroic engagement at the Battle of  Giuseppe Garibaldi   Sant’Antonio in 1846, his fame reached even to Europe, and in Italy a sword of honour, paid for by subscriptions, was donated to him. He was in charge of the defense of Montevideo for a short time in 1847, when he first came to the attention of Alexandre Dumas père, who later did much to foster his reputation. Garibaldi also greatly impressed other foreign observers as an honest and able man. His South American experiences gave him invaluable training in the techniques of guerrilla warfare that he later used with great effect against French and Austrian armies, which had not been taught how to counter them. These first exploits in the cause of freedom cast him in the mold of a professional rebel, an indomitable individualist who all his life continued to wear the gaucho costume of the pampas and to act as if life were a perpetual battle for liberty. War of liberation In April 1848 Garibaldi led 60 members of his Italian Legion back to Italy to fight for the Risorgimento, or resurrection, of Italy in the war of independence against the Austrians. He first offered to fight for Pope Pius IX, then—when his offer was refused—for Charles Albert, the king of Piedmont-Sardinia. The king, too, rebuffed him, for Garibaldi’s conviction as a rebel in 1834 was still remembered; moreover, the regular army despised the self-taught guerrilla leader. Therefore, Garibaldi went to the aid of the city of Milan, where Mazzini had already arrived and had given the war of liberation a more republican and radical turn. Charles Albert, after his defeat at the hands of the Austrians at Custoza, agreed to an armistice, but Garibaldi continued in the name of Milan what had become his private war and emerged creditably from two engagements with the Austrians at Luino and Morazzone. But at the end of August, heavily outnumbered, he had to retreat across the frontier to Switzerland. For a time Garibaldi settled down in Nice with Anita (whom he had married in 1842) and their three children, but his resolve to help free Italy from foreign rule was stronger than ever. He was confirmed in his purpose by his belief—which he and only a handful of others shared with Mazzini—that the many Italian states, though often engaged in internecine warfare, could nonetheless be unified into a single state. When Pius IX, threatened by liberal forces within the Papal States, fled from Rome toward the end of 1848, Garibaldi led a group of volunteers to that city. There, in February 1849, he was elected a deputy in the Roman Assembly, and it was he who proposed that Rome should become an independent republic. In April a French army arrived to restore papal government, and Garibaldi was the chief inspiration of a spirited defense that repulsed a French attack on the  Giuseppe Garibaldi   Janiculum Hill. In May he defeated a Neapolitan army outside Rome at Velletri, and in June he was the leading figure in the defense of Rome against a French siege. There was no chance at all of holding the city, but the gallantry of the resistance became one of the most inspiring stories of the Risorgimento. Refusing to accept defeat, Garibaldi led a few thousand men out of Rome and through central Italy in July 1849, maneuvering to avoid French and Austrian armies, until he reached the neutral republic of San Marino. Retreat There Garibaldi found himself surrounded and decided to disband his men. Soon afterward, he was pursued by the Austrians as he tried to escape. Although Anita died, Garibaldi successfully crossed the Apennines to the Tuscan coast. The retreat through central Italy, coming after the defense of Rome, made Garibaldi a well-known figure. From then on he was the “hero of two worlds.” Some criticized his military skill in this campaign, but his qualities as a leader had proved to be extraordinary, and his courage and determination not to surrender were a lesson in patriotism for his fellow countrymen. The Piedmontese monarchy, however, was too frightened to let this rebel return to his mother and children, and soon he was in exile again, first in Tangier, then on Staten Island, and finally in Peru, where he returned to his original trade as a ship’s captain. Only in 1854 was he allowed to return to Italy. The conte di Cavour, the prime minister of Piedmont, believed that by permitting Garibaldi’s repatriation he could pry him away from the republican Mazzini. In the following year, Garibaldi bought part of the island of Caprera off the Sardinian coast, which remained his home for the rest of his life. In 1856 he tried to lead an expedition to release political prisoners held by the Bourbon kings of Naples, but it came to nothing. In 1858 he received an invitation from Cavour to help prepare for another war against Austria. His task was to lead an army of volunteers from other Italian provinces, and he was given the rank of major general in the Piedmontese army. When war broke out in April 1859, he led his Cacciatori delle Alpi (Alpine Huntsmen) in the capture of Varese and Como and reached the frontier of the south Tirol. This war ended with the acquisition of Lombardy by Piedmont. In September 1859, after peace had returned to northern Italy, Garibaldi transferred his attention to central Italy, where a revolutionary government had been established in Florence. There, on several occasions, he had private meetings with King Victor Emmanuel II of Piedmont-Sardinia, and it was agreed that he should prepare to invade the Papal States; the king would support his venture if it succeeded but disown him if it failed. At the last moment, however, the king realized that the undertaking was too dangerous and asked  Giuseppe Garibaldi   Giuseppe Garibaldi Giuseppe Garibaldi in Sicily him to give up the idea. Garibaldi agreed, though reluctantly. He was ready at any moment to revive this kind of unwritten agreement with Victor Emmanuel, but it became increasingly clear that their aims were not identical. Though both men were patriots, Garibaldi was already working for the unification of Italy. The king was more prudent, concerned foremost with expanding Piedmont. Garibaldi was especially furious when, early in 1860, Cavour and Victor Emmanuel gave his hometown of Nice back to France (it had become Piedmontese in 1814), and he made one of his rare appearances in parliament to protest this violation of the national principle. In January 1860 he married Giuseppina, the daughter of the Marchese Raimondi, but abandoned her, within hours of the marriage, when he discovered she was five months pregnant, almost certainly by one of his own officers. Twenty years later, he was able to obtain the decree of nullity that enabled him to legitimize his children by Francesca Armosino, his longtime companion. Conquest of Sicily and Naples In May 1860 Garibaldi set out on the greatest venture of his life, the conquest of Sicily and Naples. This time he had no government backing, but Cavour and Victor Emmanuel did not dare to stop him, for he had become a popular hero. They stood ready to assist, but only if he proved successful, and he accepted this unwritten arrangement, confident that he could thus force Cavour to support a new move toward the unification of the Italian peninsula. Sailing from near Genoa on May 6 with about 1,000 men, he reached Marsala in Sicily on May 11 and in the name of Victor Emmanuel proclaimed himself dictator. A popular revolution in Sicily helped him considerably, for his personal charm was irresistible, and many of the peasants thought him a god intent on freeing them from slavery and feudalism. The decisive moment for his forces was a small engagement at Calatafimi, when he gave convincing proof that he could defeat the regular soldiers of the king of Naples’s army. Immediately there was a great popular movement in his support, and at the end of May he captured Palermo. The seizure of Palermo was one of Garibaldi’s most remarkable military successes, and it convinced Cavour that this volunteer army should now be strongly, if still secretly, supported by Piedmont. Moving across the island, Garibaldi won the Battle of Milazzo in July, helped by reinforcements from northern Italy. In August he crossed over the Strait of  Giuseppe Garibaldi   Giuseppe Garibaldi Messina and landed on the mainland in Calabria. As always, his strategy was to deny the enemy a moment’s pause. After a lightning campaign, he moved up through Calabria and on September 7, 1860, entered Naples, Italy’s largest city, where he proclaimed himself “Dictator of the Two Sicilies” (the name of the territories of the king of Naples, comprising Sicily and most of southern Italy). With 30,000 men under his command, he then fought the biggest battle of his career, on the Volturno River north of Naples. After his victory, he held plebiscites in Sicily and Naples, which allowed him to hand over the whole of southern Italy to King Victor Emmanuel. When the two met, Garibaldi was the first person to hail Victor Emmanuel as king of a united Italy. The king made a triumphal entry into Naples on November 7, and Garibaldi sat beside him in the royal carriage. But immediately afterward the former dictator returned to Caprera, refusing all the rewards thrust on him. He had asked for only one thing—to be allowed to continue governing Naples as the king’s viceroy until conditions returned to normal; but this was refused him, for in the eyes of the conservatives he was still a dangerous radical—an anticlerical who also professed to hold advanced ideas on social reform. He was also a man who was known to want to reconquer Rome from the pope and make it into Italy’s capital. This was too dangerous a scheme for Victor Emmanuel, for a French garrison defended papal temporal power in Rome. There was also another, more insidious danger: Garibaldi was more popular than the king himself. Furthermore, the regular army of Piedmont was deeply jealous of his successes and determined that he should not be permitted to score fresh ones. Finally, it was feared that Mazzini and the republicans might recapture Garibaldi’s allegiance and make him desert the monarchical cause. Kingdom of Italy In 1861 a new kingdom of Italy came into existence, but from the start it found Garibaldi virtually in opposition. Many people regarded him as an embarrassment. He opposed Cavour in parliament and accused the government of shabby treatment of the volunteer soldiers who had conquered half the country and given it to the king. Moreover, he condemned the inefficient administration of the provinces that he had conquered and for which he felt especially responsible. In many ways he showed that he considered himself almost an independent power, both in his dealings with his own government and with foreign powers. So admired abroad was Garibaldi that in July 1861 U.S. President  Giuseppe Garibaldi   Abraham Lincoln offered him a Union command in the American Civil War; the offer was declined, partly because Lincoln would not make a sweeping enough condemnation of slavery, but also because he would not give Garibaldi supreme command of the Federal troops. Another sign of Garibaldi’s reputation was the rapturous reception that he received in England in April 1864. Perhaps never before in history had there been such a large spontaneous gathering as the one that cheered him through the streets of London. Last campaigns Early in 1862 Victor Emmanuel again persuaded Garibaldi to lead a revolutionary expedition, this time to attack Austria in the Balkans. He was allowed to recruit another volunteer army, and munitions were collected for him in Sicily; but he then decided to use this army to attack the Papal States. Not wanting to jeopardize its relations with the French, the Italian government ordered its own forces to stop Garibaldi. At the ensuing Battle of Aspromonte, he was badly wounded and taken prisoner. When he was freed, however, the king’s complicity could no longer be denied. Garibaldi’s wound left him lame, but this did not prevent the government from using him more openly when war broke out with Austria in 1866. He was given an almost independent command in the Tirol, and once again he emerged from the war with a good deal more credit than any of the regular soldiers. This conflict led to the acquisition of Venice. In 1867 Garibaldi led another private expedition into the Papal States. This, too, was secretly subsidized by the government, though, of course, the king pretended otherwise; but political mismanagement of the whole incident forced France to intervene, and French troops defeated Garibaldi’s volunteers at Mentana. Once more he was arrested by the Italian government to cover up its complicity, but he was soon released and taken back to Caprera. Garibaldi led one final campaign in 1870–71, when he assisted the French Republic against Prussia. Again he distinguished himself, though on a small scale, and he was subsequently elected a member of the French National Assembly at Bordeaux. During the last decade of his life he was crippled by rheumatism and by his many wounds. Though he had become something of a recluse on his island, he kept abreast of affairs through the numerous deputations that called on him, and he habitually made pronouncements on affairs of the day. Toward the end he called himself a socialist, but both Karl Marx and the anarchist Mikhail Bakunin disowned him. He also became something of a pacifist, for his own experience had taught him that wars were seldom either righteous or effective in achieving their ends. Garibaldi was recognized as a champion of the rights of labour and of women’s emancipation. Moreover, he showed himself to be a religious  Giuseppe Garibaldi   freethinker and ahead of his time in believing in racial equality and the abolition of capital punishment. Legacy One of the great masters of guerrilla warfare, Garibaldi was responsible for most of the military victories of the Risorgimento. Almost equally important was his contribution as a propagandist to the unification of Italy. A man of the people, he knew far better than Cavour or Mazzini how to reach the masses with the new message of patriotism. Furthermore, his use of his military and political gifts for liberal or nationalist causes coincided well with current fashion and brought him great acclaim. In addition, he attracted support by being a truly honest man who asked little for himself. But Garibaldi’s forthright innocence coloured his politics. Not interested in power for himself, he nevertheless believed in dictatorship as a result of his South American experiences. He distrusted parliaments because he saw them to be ineffective and corrupt. Actually, his own dictatorship of southern Italy in 1860, though much criticized, compares surprisingly well with the subsequent administration by the Kingdom of Italy. There was little of the intellectual about Garibaldi, yet his simple radicalism sparked the first political awareness in many of his fellow countrymen and brought home to them the significance of nationality. Notwithstanding his turn toward socialism, he remained primarily a nationalist —but the object of his nationalism was always the liberation of peoples and not patriotic aggrandizement. To his embodiment of this aim he owes his eminent place in Italian history. Denis Mack Smith",

Giuseppe La Farina
Giuseppe La Farina, (born July 20, 1815, Messina, Sicily, kingdom of Naples [now in
Italy]—died Sept. 5, 1863, Turin, Italy), Italian revolutionary, writer, and leader and
historian of the Risorgimento.
The son of a Sicilian magistrate and scholar, La Farina received a law degree in 1835 and
soon became involved with a secret committee for Italian unity; he was forced into exile
after it attempted an insurrection in 1837. Receiving amnesty in 1838, he returned to
Messina and took up literary work, while also engaging in revolutionary work in Naples
and Palermo.
In Florence after 1841, La Farina lived by his pen; in 1847 he founded the political journal
L’Alba. At the outbreak of revolution in 1848, he returned to Messina, served successively
as deputy and secretary to the chamber of communes at Palermo, minister of public
instruction and public works, and minister of war and the navy. But he was exiled again in
April, when the revolution failed, and he remained in Paris until 1853, when he returned to
Turin. In 1857 he helped found the Italian National Society, a nationalist organization.
After 1857 he was in frequent secret contact with the unification leader Count Cavour,
planning annexation demands and policy and organizing military moves. Although he
helped to furnish Sicilian funds for Giuseppe Garibaldi’s conquest of Sicily and Naples in
1860, La Farina lost favour with Garibaldi when he began circulating an annexationist
paper in Palermo called L’Annessione, and he was arrested and deported to Genoa in July
1860. Earlier that year, he had been elected to the Chamber of Deputies, and he later
became a councillor of state.
La Farina’s greatest literary work was the Storia d’Italia dal 1815 al 1850 (1851–52),
which included a discussion of Italy’s future as a nation. His letters have been collected and
edited by Ausonio Franchi in the two-volume Epistolario di Giuseppe La Farina (1869).
La Farina’s other works include the two-volume Studi sul secolo XIII (1841; “Study of the
13th Century”), the 10-volume Storia d’Italia (1846; “History of Italy”), and Rivoluzione
siciliana nel 1848 e 49 (1851; “Sicilian Revolution in 1848–49”).

Giuseppe Mazzini
Giuseppe Mazzini
Giuseppe Mazzini, (born June 22, 1805, Genoa
[Italy]—died March 10, 1872, Pisa, Italy), Genoese
propagandist and revolutionary, founder of the secret
revolutionary society Young Italy (1832), and a
champion of the movement for Italian unity known as
the Risorgimento. An uncompromising republican, he
refused to participate in the parliamentary
government that was established under the monarchy of the House of Savoy when Italy
became unified and independent (1861).
Education and exile.
Giuseppe Mazzini was a doctor’s son; his birthplace, formerly a republic, was annexed to
the Kingdom of Piedmont in 1814. As a child, he gave promise of high intellectual ability,
fully confirmed when he entered the University of Genoa at 14. Two years later, strongly
influenced by seeing a patriot fleeing from Italy after an unsuccessful insurrection, he
began to think “that we Italians could and therefore ought to struggle for the liberty of our
country.”
On graduating in law in 1827, he practiced as a “poor man’s lawyer,” wrote articles for
progressive reviews, and hoped to become a dramatist or historical novelist. But his life
was already shaping itself differently. His love of freedom led him to join the Carbonari, a
secret society pledged to overthrow absolute rule in Italy. In 1830 he was betrayed to the
police, arrested, and interned at Savona, where for three months he reviewed his political
beliefs and conceived the outlines of a new patriotic movement to replace the decaying
Carbonari.
When released early in 1831, he was ordered either to leave Piedmont or to live in some
small town. He chose exile and went to Marseille, where his slight figure, handsome olive
features, black hair and beard, and black velvet suit were soon familiar to the other Italian
exiles, who accepted him as their leader. His first public gesture was an “open letter” to
Charles Albert, the king of Piedmont, urging him to give Piedmont constitutional
government, to lead a national movement, and to expel the Austrians from Lombardy-
Venetia and their other Italian strongholds. The letter was circulated in Italy, but Charles
Albert’s only reaction was to threaten Mazzini with arrest if he returned to Piedmont. As a

lifelong republican, Mazzini was afterward censured for this friendly approach to an
autocratic sovereign; he explained that he had meant to expose Charles Albert as one who
would never fight for Italian freedom.
Foundation of Young Italy.
At Marseille Mazzini spent two of his most rewarding years. He founded his patriotic
movement for young men and called it Giovine Italia (Young Italy). It was designed as a
national association for liberating the separate Italian states from foreign rule and fusing
them into a free and independent unitary republic. Its methods were education and
insurrection, and it had a moral basis derived from Mazzini’s own belief in God (though he
was not a Christian) and in permanent laws of progress, duty, and sacrifice. It was the first
Italian democratic movement embracing all classes, for Mazzini believed that only a
popular initiative could free Italy. “Neither pope nor king,” he declared. “Only God and the
people will open the way of the future to us.”
The new movement captured the imagination of Italian youth. Branches were secretly
formed in Genoa and other cities; by 1833 there were 60,000 members. Mazzini edited the
propagandist journal Giovine Italia, which was smuggled into Italy with other
revolutionary pamphlets. He also became the lover of a fellow exile, the beautiful
Modenese widow Giuditta Sidoli.
Young Italy’s attempted insurrections were failures. A projected rising in Piedmont in 1833
was discovered before it had begun; 12 conspirators were executed, one committed suicide,
and Mazzini was tried in absence and condemned to death. He said prophetically, “Ideas
ripen quickly when nourished by the blood of martyrs.” A few months later, when he had
moved to Switzerland to escape from the French police, he tried to rally 1,000 volunteers to
invade Savoy (then part of the kingdom of Piedmont). Only 200 could be mustered, and the
force was disbanded.
These failures destroyed Young Italy as an organization, though its spirit lived on. Mazzini
turned to wider revolutionary plans, based on his faith in the brotherhood of man and his
hopes for a world republican federation. He founded Young Europe and helped to establish
Young Germany, Young Switzerland, and Young Poland, but his three years in Switzerland
were unhappy and frustrated. Giuditta Sidoli had gone back to Italy to rejoin her children;
he suffered an emotional crisis through doubts and disillusionment. In 1837 he went with a
few Italian friends to live in London.
Stay in England.

England was now his real home. He lived in modest London lodgings, surrounded by
books, papers, and the tame birds in which he delighted; he studied at the British Museum
and wrote for English periodicals. Though he had little money, he started a school for
Italian boys in London and a newspaper, Apostolato popolare (“Apostleship of the
People”), in which he published part of his essay “On the Duties of Man.” In 1840, with the
help of Giuseppe Lamberti in Paris, he revived Young Italy, primarily as a means of
building up a national consciousness among Italians everywhere. He wrote innumerable
letters to his new agents in Europe and North and South America; he also became
acquainted with Thomas and Jane Welsh Carlyle and other notable people.
In 1844 he was in touch with the Bandiera brothers, who made an ill-fated attempt to start a
revolt in Calabria. After their execution, he told two friends who were members of
Parliament of his fears that the British government was opening his letters and had passed
on information about the Bandieras’ plans to the Neapolitan authorities. The matter was
raised in Parliament, and the government was compelled to admit that it opened private
letters. There was much public indignation and widespread sympathy with Mazzini. The
affair made him better known in England and brought him into contact with a notable
liberal family, the Ashursts. Many English liberals supported him when he founded the
People’s International League in 1847.
In that year he wrote an “open letter” to the new pope, Pius IX, who had introduced liberal
reforms in the Papal States. He urged the pope to unify Italy, but Pius made no comment.
Mazzini returned to Italy for the first time in the revolutionary year of 1848, when the
Milanese drove out their Austrian masters and Piedmont began a war to expel the Austrians
from Italy. Milan welcomed him, but he was soon unpopular because he wanted Lombardy
to become a republic and he thought that union with the kingdom of Piedmont, as proposed
by the Milanese provisional government, was the wrong kind of pattern for the future Italy.
When the Piedmontese armies withdrew and the Austrians reentered Milan, he served
briefly with an irregular force under Giuseppe Garibaldi before returning to England.
Triumvir of republican Rome.
Mazzini was again in Italy in 1849, first in Tuscany and then in Rome, where a revolution
had driven out the pope and a republic had been proclaimed. He had long believed that the
imperial and papal Romes would be followed by a third Rome—a Rome of the people;
now his dream had come true. He was acclaimed as a great patriot, was elected a triumvir
of the republic, and became the effective head of the government, showing great
administrative talent in ecclesiastical and social reforms. His rule was short-lived. The pope

appealed to Catholic countries for help, and a French army landed in Italy; after heroic
resistance, the republic was crushed, and Mazzini left Rome.
Back in London, he founded another society—the Friends of Italy—in 1851 and was soon
involved in new revolutionary activities. In 1853 he backed the Milanese workers in their
unsuccessful rising against the Austrians. In 1853–54 he sent Felice Orsini on two
unproductive missions to raise a revolt in Carrara. In 1856 he went secretly to Genoa to
plan a number of simultaneous insurrections. The only one that was seriously attempted
was Carlo Pisacane’s disastrous landing in Calabria in 1857. Even the apparently futile
conspiracies of this period had the useful effect, however, of keeping Italian problems
before the governments of Europe. For these plots Mazzini was reviled in Piedmont, where
the new moderate party was working for orderly progress without revolution. Count
Cavour, the prime minister, called him “chief of the assassins,” but this charge was unfair;
Mazzini’s plots were for insurrection, not assassination, and he expressly disclaimed the
“theory of the dagger.”
In 1858 Mazzini founded another journal in London: this was Pensiero ed azione
(“Thought and Action”), a title reflecting his view that thought is only of value when it
results in action. He did not participate in the Franco-Piedmontese war against Austria in
1859, by which Cavour with the help of Napoleon III vainly sought to free Italy from the
Alps to the Adriatic; nor did he belong to the “party of action,” which sponsored Giuseppe
Garibaldi’s expedition to Sicily in 1860. Yet this expedition has been called “Mazzini’s gift
to the ‘party of action,’ ” for it followed plans devised by him in earlier years. Mazzini
went to Naples during Garibaldi’s brief dictatorship of southern Italy but was back in
London when the new united Kingdom of Italy (excluding Venice and Rome) was
proclaimed in 1861.
Impractical schemes for seizing Venice and Rome occupied Mazzini’s mind in the 1860s.
This was the decade of the Socialist First International; he had early contact with its
members but soon withdrew, since the moral and religious basis of his own political
thought prevented him from accepting either Karl Marx’s communism or Mikhail
Bakunin’s anarchism. Messina repeatedly elected him as its parliamentary deputy, but the
elections were quashed by the Italian government. In 1870 he misguidedly agreed to lead a
republican rising in Sicily. He was arrested on his way there and interned at Gaeta but was
released and pardoned after the occupation of Rome by Italian troops.
Accomplishments and reputation.

Mazzini’s life was ending in disappointment, even though both Venice (acquired in 1866)
and Rome were now part of the new kingdom. Italy had been united by fusion, as he had
always advocated against strong opposition, rather than by federation, but it was a
monarchy and not the republic he had wanted. “I thought I was awakening the soul of Italy,
and I see only the corpse before me,” he said.
In his last years he founded another paper, Roma del popolo (“Rome of the People”), which
he edited from Lugano, and made plans for an Italian workingmen’s congress. He died
from pleurisy at Pisa in 1872. He had never married.
Mazzini’s reputation has fluctuated greatly. In his earlier years, he was an almost legendary
hero in his own country, but he was later denounced by many of his compatriots as an
enemy of the state. For two generations after his death, most historians considered that his
useful work ended in 1849 and that he should then have withdrawn from conspiracy.
A different view, however, prevails among modern historians. Many believe that all his
plots were valuable, since they held out a permanent threat of violent revolution if Italy
were not freed and united. By spurring on the Piedmontese government, and later the
Italian government, to work for the national cause, he is now considered to have played an
indispensable part in the making of modern Italy.

As a  Giuseppe Mazzini   lifelong republican, Mazzini was afterward censured for this friendly approach to an autocratic sovereign; he explained that he had meant to expose Charles Albert as one who would never fight for Italian freedom. Foundation of Young Italy. At Marseille Mazzini spent two of his most rewarding years. He founded his patriotic movement for young men and called it Giovine Italia (Young Italy). It was designed as a national association for liberating the separate Italian states from foreign rule and fusing them into a free and independent unitary republic. Its methods were education and insurrection, and it had a moral basis derived from Mazzini’s own belief in God (though he was not a Christian) and in permanent laws of progress, duty, and sacrifice. It was the first Italian democratic movement embracing all classes, for Mazzini believed that only a popular initiative could free Italy. “Neither pope nor king,” he declared. “Only God and the people will open the way of the future to us.” The new movement captured the imagination of Italian youth. Branches were secretly formed in Genoa and other cities; by 1833 there were 60,000 members. Mazzini edited the propagandist journal Giovine Italia, which was smuggled into Italy with other revolutionary pamphlets. He also became the lover of a fellow exile, the beautiful Modenese widow Giuditta Sidoli. Young Italy’s attempted insurrections were failures. A projected rising in Piedmont in 1833 was discovered before it had begun; 12 conspirators were executed, one committed suicide, and Mazzini was tried in absence and condemned to death. He said prophetically, “Ideas ripen quickly when nourished by the blood of martyrs.” A few months later, when he had moved to Switzerland to escape from the French police, he tried to rally 1,000 volunteers to invade Savoy (then part of the kingdom of Piedmont). Only 200 could be mustered, and the force was disbanded. These failures destroyed Young Italy as an organization, though its spirit lived on. Mazzini turned to wider revolutionary plans, based on his faith in the brotherhood of man and his hopes for a world republican federation. He founded Young Europe and helped to establish Young Germany, Young Switzerland, and Young Poland, but his three years in Switzerland were unhappy and frustrated. Giuditta Sidoli had gone back to Italy to rejoin her children; he suffered an emotional crisis through doubts and disillusionment. In 1837 he went with a few Italian friends to live in London. Stay in England. Giuseppe Mazzini   England was now his real home. He lived in modest London lodgings, surrounded by books, papers, and the tame birds in which he delighted; he studied at the British Museum and wrote for English periodicals. Though he had little money, he started a school for Italian boys in London and a newspaper, Apostolato popolare (“Apostleship of the People”), in which he published part of his essay “On the Duties of Man.” In 1840, with the help of Giuseppe Lamberti in Paris, he revived Young Italy, primarily as a means of building up a national consciousness among Italians everywhere. He wrote innumerable letters to his new agents in Europe and North and South America; he also became acquainted with Thomas and Jane Welsh Carlyle and other notable people. In 1844 he was in touch with the Bandiera brothers, who made an ill-fated attempt to start a revolt in Calabria. After their execution, he told two friends who were members of Parliament of his fears that the British government was opening his letters and had passed on information about the Bandieras’ plans to the Neapolitan authorities. The matter was raised in Parliament, and the government was compelled to admit that it opened private letters. There was much public indignation and widespread sympathy with Mazzini. The affair made him better known in England and brought him into contact with a notable liberal family, the Ashursts. Many English liberals supported him when he founded the People’s International League in 1847. In that year he wrote an “open letter” to the new pope, Pius IX, who had introduced liberal reforms in the Papal States. He urged the pope to unify Italy, but Pius made no comment. Mazzini returned to Italy for the first time in the revolutionary year of 1848, when the Milanese drove out their Austrian masters and Piedmont began a war to expel the Austrians from Italy. Milan welcomed him, but he was soon unpopular because he wanted Lombardy to become a republic and he thought that union with the kingdom of Piedmont, as proposed by the Milanese provisional government, was the wrong kind of pattern for the future Italy. When the Piedmontese armies withdrew and the Austrians reentered Milan, he served briefly with an irregular force under Giuseppe Garibaldi before returning to England. Triumvir of republican Rome. Mazzini was again in Italy in 1849, first in Tuscany and then in Rome, where a revolution had driven out the pope and a republic had been proclaimed. He had long believed that the imperial and papal Romes would be followed by a third Rome—a Rome of the people; now his dream had come true. He was acclaimed as a great patriot, was elected a triumvir of the republic, and became the effective head of the government, showing great administrative talent in ecclesiastical and social reforms. His rule was short-lived. The pope  Giuseppe Mazzini   appealed to Catholic countries for help, and a French army landed in Italy; after heroic resistance, the republic was crushed, and Mazzini left Rome. Back in London, he founded another society—the Friends of Italy—in 1851 and was soon involved in new revolutionary activities. In 1853 he backed the Milanese workers in their unsuccessful rising against the Austrians. In 1853–54 he sent Felice Orsini on two unproductive missions to raise a revolt in Carrara. In 1856 he went secretly to Genoa to plan a number of simultaneous insurrections. The only one that was seriously attempted was Carlo Pisacane’s disastrous landing in Calabria in 1857. Even the apparently futile conspiracies of this period had the useful effect, however, of keeping Italian problems before the governments of Europe. For these plots Mazzini was reviled in Piedmont, where the new moderate party was working for orderly progress without revolution. Count Cavour, the prime minister, called him “chief of the assassins,” but this charge was unfair; Mazzini’s plots were for insurrection, not assassination, and he expressly disclaimed the “theory of the dagger.” In 1858 Mazzini founded another journal in London: this was Pensiero ed azione (“Thought and Action”), a title reflecting his view that thought is only of value when it results in action. He did not participate in the Franco-Piedmontese war against Austria in 1859, by which Cavour with the help of Napoleon III vainly sought to free Italy from the Alps to the Adriatic; nor did he belong to the “party of action,” which sponsored Giuseppe Garibaldi’s expedition to Sicily in 1860. Yet this expedition has been called “Mazzini’s gift to the ‘party of action,’ ” for it followed plans devised by him in earlier years. Mazzini went to Naples during Garibaldi’s brief dictatorship of southern Italy but was back in London when the new united Kingdom of Italy (excluding Venice and Rome) was proclaimed in 1861. Impractical schemes for seizing Venice and Rome occupied Mazzini’s mind in the 1860s. This was the decade of the Socialist First International; he had early contact with its members but soon withdrew, since the moral and religious basis of his own political thought prevented him from accepting either Karl Marx’s communism or Mikhail Bakunin’s anarchism. Messina repeatedly elected him as its parliamentary deputy, but the elections were quashed by the Italian government. In 1870 he misguidedly agreed to lead a republican rising in Sicily. He was arrested on his way there and interned at Gaeta but was released and pardoned after the occupation of Rome by Italian troops. Accomplishments and reputation. Giuseppe Mazzini   Mazzini’s life was ending in disappointment, even though both Venice (acquired in 1866) and Rome were now part of the new kingdom. Italy had been united by fusion, as he had always advocated against strong opposition, rather than by federation, but it was a monarchy and not the republic he had wanted. “I thought I was awakening the soul of Italy, and I see only the corpse before me,” he said. In his last years he founded another paper, Roma del popolo (“Rome of the People”), which he edited from Lugano, and made plans for an Italian workingmen’s congress. He died from pleurisy at Pisa in 1872. He had never married. Mazzini’s reputation has fluctuated greatly. In his earlier years, he was an almost legendary hero in his own country, but he was later denounced by many of his compatriots as an enemy of the state. For two generations after his death, most historians considered that his useful work ended in 1849 and that he should then have withdrawn from conspiracy. A different view, however, prevails among modern historians. Many believe that all his plots were valuable, since they held out a permanent threat of violent revolution if Italy were not freed and united. By spurring on the Piedmontese government, and later the Italian government, to work for the national cause, he is now considered to have played an indispensable part in the making of modern Italy.

Goffredo Mameli, (born Sept. 5, 1827, Genoa [Italy]—died July 6, 1849, Rome), Italian
poet and patriot of the Risorgimento and author of the Italian national anthem, “Inno di
Mameli” (“Mameli Hymn”), popularly known as “Fratelli d’Italia” (“Brothers of Italy”).
Giuseppe Mazzini, the republican leader, was a friend of Mameli’s mother and inspired
Mameli with his patriotic ideals. As a student, Mameli began writing verses expressing
patriotic and republican sentiments. “Fratelli d’Italia,” written in 1847 and set to music by
Michele Novaro, overnight became the national hymn of revolution and independence. In
1848 Mameli volunteered for service in the war against the Austrians. In 1849 he was in
Rome when the Roman Republic was proclaimed and sent Mazzini the famous summons:
“Roma! Repubblica! Venite!” (“Rome! Republic! Come!”). Joining the patriot Giuseppe
Garibaldi’s force, he was twice wounded, the second time fatally, while defending Rome
against the French army sent by Louis-Napoléon Bonaparte.

Golda Meir, original name Goldie Mabovitch, later
Goldie Myerson, (born May 3, 1898, Kiev [Ukraine]
—died December 8, 1978, Jerusalem), Israeli
politician who helped found (1948) the State of Israel
and later served as its fourth prime minister (1969–
74). She was the first woman to hold the post.
In 1906 Goldie Mabovitch’s family immigrated to Milwaukee, Wisconsin, where she
attended the Milwaukee Normal School (now University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee) and
later became a leader in the Milwaukee Labor Zionist Party. In 1921 she and her husband,
Morris Myerson, immigrated to Palestine and joined the Merẖavya kibbutz. She became
the kibbutz’s representative to the Histadrut (General Federation of Labour), the secretary
of that organization’s Women’s Labour Council (1928–32), and a member of its executive
committee (1934 until World War II). During the war, she emerged as a forceful spokesman
for the Zionist cause in negotiating with the British mandatory authorities. In 1946, when
the British arrested and detained many Jewish activists, including Moshe Sharett, head of
the Political Department of the Jewish Agency, Goldie Myerson provisionally replaced him
and worked for the release of her comrades and the many Jewish war refugees who had
violated British immigration regulations by settling in Palestine. Upon his release, Sharett
took up diplomatic duties, and she officially took over his former position. She personally
attempted to dissuade King ʿAbdullāh I of Jordan from joining the invasion of Israel
decided on by other Arab states.
On May 14, 1948, Goldie Myerson was a signatory of
Israel’s independence declaration, and that year she
was appointed minister to Moscow. She was elected
to the Knesset (Israeli parliament) in 1949 and served
in that body until 1974. As minister of labour (1949–
56), she carried out major programs of housing and
road construction and vigorously supported the policy
of unrestricted Jewish immigration to Israel.
Appointed foreign minister in 1956, she Hebraized her name to Golda Meir. She promoted
the Israeli policy of assistance to the new African states aimed at enhancing diplomatic
support among uncommitted nations. Shortly after retiring from the Foreign Ministry in

January 1966, she became secretary-general of the Mapai Party and supported Prime
Minister Levi Eshkol in intraparty conflicts. After Israel’s victory in the Six-Day War (June
1967) against Egypt, Jordan, and Syria, she helped merge Mapai with two dissident parties
into the Israel Labour Party.
Upon Eshkol’s death on February 26, 1969, Meir, the compromise candidate, became
prime minister. She maintained the coalition government that had emerged in June 1967.
Meir pressed for a peace settlement in the Middle East by diplomatic means. She traveled
widely, her meetings including those with Nicolae Ceauşescu in Romania (1972) and Pope
Paul VI at the Vatican (1973). Also in 1973, Meir’s government was host to Willy Brandt,
chancellor of West Germany.
Her efforts at forging a peace with the Arab states
were halted by the outbreak in October 1973 of the
fourth Arab-Israeli war, called the Yom Kippur War.
Israel’s lack of readiness for the war stunned the
nation, and Meir formed a new coalition government
only with great difficulty in March 1974 and resigned
her post as prime minister on April 10. She remained
in power as head of a caretaker government until a new one was formed in June. Although
in retirement thereafter, she remained an important political figure. Upon her death it was
revealed that she had had leukemia for 12 years. Her autobiography, My Life, was
published in 1975.

Gonzalo Pizarro
Gonzalo Pizarro, (born 1502?, Trujillo, Spain—died April 10, 1548, Cuzco, Peru),
Spanish conqueror and explorer and leader of antiroyal forces in Peru. Pizarro is considered
by some historians to be the leader of the first genuine struggle by colonists for
independence from Spanish domination in America.
A half brother of Francisco Pizarro, with whom he fought during the conquest of Peru
(1531–33), Gonzalo received for his services extensive land grants and was made governor
of Quito in 1539. In 1541, with 200 Spaniards, some 4,000 Indians, and numerous horses
and other animals, he led an expedition into the unexplored region east of Quito. After his
lieutenant, Francisco de Orellana, left him in search of provisions, Pizarro and his men
waited in vain for his return. Forced to eat their dogs and horses, they finally staggered
back to Quito in August 1542. Only a few Spaniards and no Indians survived the disastrous
expedition.
On his return, Pizarro learned that his half brother Francisco had been assassinated in 1541
and that he had been ordered to dismiss his men. The king of Spain had promulgated new
laws restricting the privileges of the conquistadores and protecting the rights of the Indians.
Objecting to these edicts, the Spaniards intended to fight for their prerogatives and
acclaimed Pizarro as the governor of Peru. As the leader of the antiroyal forces, he took the
field against the viceroy Blasco Núñez Vela, winning the Battle of Anaquito in 1546, and
against the viceroy Pedro de la Gasca in 1548. Defeated and captured by de la Gasca on
April 9 of that year, Pizarro was executed the following day.

Victoria, Guadalupe
Guadalupe Victoria
Guadalupe Victoria, original name Manuel Félix
Fernández, (born 1786, Tamazuela, Mex.—died
1843, Perote), Mexican soldier and political leader
who was the first president of the Mexican Republic.
Victoria left law school to join the movement for
independence from Spain, fighting under José María
Morelos in 1812. He changed his name to show his devotion to the cause of Mexican
independence (the image of the Virgin of Guadalupe, the patron saint of Mexico, had been
adopted as a symbol of the insurgency). After the death of Morelos, Victoria waged
guerrilla war against the Spaniards from the mountains around Veracruz and Puebla. When
Agustín de Iturbide came to power (1821), Victoria at first supported him, but by 1822, as
Iturbide arrested all political opponents and dissolved the legislature, Victoria denounced
him and joined Antonio López de Santa Anna’s successful revolt in 1823.
Victoria became Mexico’s first elected president (1824–29), but, while honest, unassuming,
and a courageous general, he was not particularly suited for the presidency. The
inexperienced administrator was not able to deal effectively with the constant political
bickering and Byzantine machinations of government rivals, often being taken advantage
of by those he trusted. It is small wonder that little progress was made domestically and the
economy was in a shambles. During Victoria’s tenure in office, Iturbide was executed. In
foreign affairs, Victoria managed much better and established relations with all the major
powers. The bitterest blow of his term came in 1827 when his vice president, Nicolás
Bravo, led a revolt against Victoria. It was easily suppressed by his comrades from
revolutionary times, Generals Santa Anna and Vicente Guerrero.

commission in the royal army and helped suppress brigands in Calabria; but, when
revolution broke out in 1820, he took command of the republican army. Failure of the
revolution sent him into exile, mainly in England, where he spent the next several years
writing of his experiences, including A Narrative of the Political and Military Events

Habib Bourguiba
Habib Bourguiba, in full Habib ibn Ali Bourguiba, (born Aug. 3, 1903, Monastir, Tun.—
died April 6, 2000, Monastir), architect of Tunisia’s independence and first president of
Tunisia (1957–87), one of the major voices of moderation and gradualism in the Arab
world.
Early life
Bourguiba was born the seventh child of Ali Bourguiba, a former lieutenant in the army of
the bey (ruler) of Tunisia, in the small fishing village of Monastir. At an early age he was
sent to the Ṣadīqī (Sadiki) College in Tunis and later to the Lycée Carnot in the same city
for his secondary education. There he was introduced to French culture and Western
thought, even as he consolidated his education in Arabic and Islamic studies. In 1924 he
went to Paris to study law and political science at the Sorbonne, where he developed
contacts with Algerian and Moroccan pro-independence intellectuals. He also absorbed
many of the philosophical and ideological currents of the time and was drawn especially to
the secularist and reformist traditions of French bourgeois life.
Bourguiba returned to Tunisia in 1927, where he practiced law and became engaged in the
political struggle for independence, notably through the foundation in 1932 of a nationalist
newspaper (L’Action Tunisienne) and his activity in the Destour (Constitution) Party. He
soon became frustrated with the leaders of the Destour, whom he considered to be
conservative and timid. In 1934 Bourguiba and some of his associates called a special party
congress in Ksar Hellal (Qaṣr Hallāl) and established their own party—the New Destour, or
Neo-Destour, Party (from 1964 to 1987 the Destourian Socialist Party [Parti Socialiste
Destourien], and later the Democratic Constitutional Rally [Rassemblement
Constitutionnel Démocratique])—of which Bourguiba became the secretary-general.
Bourguiba encouraged his fellow Tunisians to confront the colonial rulers, resulting in his
exile by the French to prison in the desolate south. By that time he was an acknowledged
leader of the developing nationalist movement, with a reputation for fiery and inspiring
oration; he had become known as the combattant suprême (Arabic: al-mujāhid al-akbar).
Attainment of power
Upon his release from prison in 1936, Bourguiba focused his energies on building up the
organizational structures of the party. He realized that the old Destour had failed to
mobilize the masses because it had remained the province of urban intellectuals. To be

effective, the Neo-Destour would have to develop truly national appeal, with branches in
rural areas to recruit and train new party members in large numbers. He supported
organized labour, in particular the establishment of the National Tunisian Union of Labour
(Union Générale des Travailleurs Tunisiens), partly as a way of countering the influence of
the Communist-supported General Confederation of Tunisian Workers (Confédération
Générale des Travailleurs) and partly to tie working-class interests to the nationalist cause.
Under his direction the party also established new organizations to mobilize students,
craftsmen, farmers, and women, which would later form the organizational and institutional
bases of Neo-Destour rule.
After a second period of internment, this time in French military prisons (1938–42),
Bourguiba returned to a German-occupied Tunis. Convinced that the Allies would
ultimately prevail, he refused to throw in his lot with the Germans. In 1945 he left the
country for Egypt, where he continued to advocate Tunisian independence. He also traveled
around Europe, East Asia, the Middle East, and the United States, attempting to win
supporters to his cause and demonstrating the pragmatic, nonaligned diplomacy that would
serve him so well in his later life. Returning to Tunisia in 1949, he once again toured the
country. By 1950 the Destour was represented in the Tunisian government, which was
negotiating relations with France. Lacking official status, Bourguiba was excluded from the
talks, which themselves yielded little progress. In 1951 he traveled to Paris to try to break
the deadlocked discussions. With strikes and demonstrations in favour of independence at
home and the French determined to protect the interests of their settlers, tensions mounted.
Bourguiba was arrested again in 1952 and detained, first in Tunisia and later in France. In
1954, however, as Tunisian nationalists turned to terrorism, the French government began
negotiations with Bourguiba, recognizing Tunisia’s internal autonomy as a first step. A new
government, which included the Neo-Destour, was formed with the express purpose of
negotiating an end to French rule. The first stage was completed in June 1955 when the
internal autonomy convention was signed, limiting French control to matters of defense
and foreign affairs. One of Bourguiba’s fellow Neo-Destour leaders, Salah Ben Youssef,
argued against the accords, and the party was split, resolving in Bourguiba’s favour only
after a congress in which Ben Youssef was expelled from the party. Bourguiba
subsequently worked to prevent any individual from developing a power base within the
party to such an extent as could threaten either party unity or Bourguiba’s own authority.
After further negotiations the Protocol of March 20, 1956—in effect a treaty of
independence—was signed between Tunisia and France. In 1957 agreement was reached,

in principle, for the evacuation of French forces from the country (with the exception of a
base at Bizerte). The monarchy was abolished, and Bourguiba was elected president of the
new republic.
Presidency
Bourguiba set about shaping the new republic in accordance with his personal vision. In
1959 the Neo-Destour won all 90 seats in the new National Assembly, and a constitution
was introduced that made the assembly solely responsible for rule and order in the country.
The role of Islam in Tunisian identity was recognized, although the workings of
government were to be exclusively secular. Women’s rights were recognized in the 1956
Code of Personal Status, an extraordinarily radical document for its time that, among other
things, banned polygamy, gave women virtual legal equality with men, enabled women to
initiate divorce, introduced a legal minimum age for marriage, and gave women the right to
be educated. Education was extended throughout the country, and the curriculum was
modernized to reduce religious influence. The military was firmly subordinated to civilian
government, and the administration underwent a process of “Tunisification” to replace
French workers with Tunisian counterparts.
An experiment with a collectivist form of socialism was abandoned in 1969. The World
Bank had refused to fund the program, significant sections of the agricultural community
had resisted it, and the experiment failed to produce the desired increases in output; in
addition, Bourguiba became convinced that the program’s primary advocate, Ahmed Ben
Salah, was using it to enhance his own ambitions. During the 1970s Bourguiba oversaw an
export-oriented policy, fueled by domestic oil revenues, labour remittances, and foreign
borrowing. When all three sources dried up in the 1980s, the country was deeply in need of
investment finance. The private sector, which had been partially subsidized by the
government but equally excluded from certain areas of production and price setting, was
unable to fill the gap, and the country spiraled into debt-ridden crisis, finally turning to the
International Monetary Fund for a structural adjustment program in 1986.
Bourguiba’s foreign policy reflected his preference for pragmatism over ideology. He
looked to the West for economic and military assistance, but that did not prevent him from
engaging non-Western countries in pursuit of export markets and bilateral trade. He aspired
to maintain a special relationship with France, believing that there were positive economic,
cultural, and social legacies of colonialism to be exploited. Despite major crises over
Tunisian support for the Algerian liberation struggle, a Tunisian attack on the French base
at Bizerte, and the expropriation of settlers’ lands, Bourguiba generally managed to secure
1/16/23, 2:25 PM

https://www.britannica.com/print/article/75869
4/5
a lasting and cordial friendship between the two countries. He also worked tirelessly to
develop good relations with the United States, being eager to link Tunisia in to the
technologies of modernization. To the chagrin of the Arab world, he advocated a moderate
and constructive position toward Israel; nonetheless, he supported the rights of the
Palestinians and offered the Palestine Liberation Organization a base when it was expelled
from Lebanon in 1982 (see Palestine: The dispersal of the PLO from Lebanon).
The Neo-Destour, renamed the Destourian Socialist Party (Parti Socialiste Destourien) in
1964, retained its monopoly over domestic politics. National organizations allowed for
some popular mobilization and representation, but by the 1970s liberals within the party
became impatient with Bourguiba’s tendency to centralize power in himself. As dissidents
within the party broke away to form their own underground political movements in the
1970s, Bourguiba became more authoritarian and detached from the party’s base. Promises
of political liberalization failed to materialize. By the 1980s he was convinced that an
Islamist revival threatened the country, and, following a series of bomb attacks by Islamist
elements on his beloved hometown of Monastir, he ordered a ferocious assault on the
leadership and ranks of the Islamic Tendency Movement (Mouvement de la Tendance
Islamique). A trial ensued, exposing abuses by the country’s security forces, and Tunisia
stood at the brink of political and economic crisis, prompting a constitutional coup that
removed Bourguiba on the grounds of ill mental health.
Later years
A charismatic personality, Bourguiba largely remained the father figure who led Tunisia to
independence, although his own popularity had waned when he became increasingly
authoritarian. By actively preventing the emergence of a successor, he essentially forced his
election as president-for-life in 1975; yet, that his own removal was conducted in a
peaceful and constitutional manner has been seen by both Tunisians and scholars of the
country as a testament to the moderacy and desire for stability with which he imbued
Tunisian politics. At the time of his ouster, Bourguiba was already age 84 and, despite his
failing health, had ruled the country for 30 years. After his removal from office, he was
confined to his house in Monastir by the new regime and was permitted only infrequent
visitors. His death at home in 2000 after a period of prolonged illness was marked by a
subdued but nonetheless respectful period of national mourning, and he was buried in his
family mausoleum in Monastir.

independence and first president of Tunisia (1957–87), one of the major voices of moderation and gradualism in the Arab world. Early life Bourguiba was born the seventh child of Ali Bourguiba, a former lieutenant in the army of the bey (ruler) of Tunisia, in the small fishing village of Monastir. At an early age he was sent to the Ṣadīqī (Sadiki) College in Tunis and later to the Lycée Carnot in the same city for his secondary education. There he was introduced to French culture and Western thought, even as he consolidated his education in Arabic and Islamic studies. In 1924 he went to Paris to study law and political science at the Sorbonne, where he developed contacts with Algerian and Moroccan pro-independence intellectuals. He also absorbed many of the philosophical and ideological currents of the time and was drawn especially to the secularist and reformist traditions of French bourgeois life. Bourguiba returned to Tunisia in 1927, where he practiced law and became engaged in the political struggle for independence, notably through the foundation in 1932 of a nationalist newspaper (L’Action Tunisienne) and his activity in the Destour (Constitution) Party. He soon became frustrated with the leaders of the Destour, whom he considered to be conservative and timid. In 1934 Bourguiba and some of his associates called a special party congress in Ksar Hellal (Qaṣr Hallāl) and established their own party—the New Destour, or Neo-Destour, Party (from 1964 to 1987 the Destourian Socialist Party [Parti Socialiste Destourien], and later the Democratic Constitutional Rally [Rassemblement Constitutionnel Démocratique])—of which Bourguiba became the secretary-general. Bourguiba encouraged his fellow Tunisians to confront the colonial rulers, resulting in his exile by the French to prison in the desolate south. By that time he was an acknowledged leader of the developing nationalist movement, with a reputation for fiery and inspiring oration; he had become known as the combattant suprême (Arabic: al-mujāhid al-akbar). Attainment of power Upon his release from prison in 1936, Bourguiba focused his energies on building up the organizational structures of the party. He realized that the old Destour had failed to mobilize the masses because it had remained the province of urban intellectuals. To be  Habib Bourguiba   effective, the Neo-Destour would have to develop truly national appeal, with branches in rural areas to recruit and train new party members in large numbers. He supported organized labour, in particular the establishment of the National Tunisian Union of Labour (Union Générale des Travailleurs Tunisiens), partly as a way of countering the influence of the Communist-supported General Confederation of Tunisian Workers (Confédération Générale des Travailleurs) and partly to tie working-class interests to the nationalist cause. Under his direction the party also established new organizations to mobilize students, craftsmen, farmers, and women, which would later form the organizational and institutional bases of Neo-Destour rule. After a second period of internment, this time in French military prisons (1938–42), Bourguiba returned to a German-occupied Tunis. Convinced that the Allies would ultimately prevail, he refused to throw in his lot with the Germans. In 1945 he left the country for Egypt, where he continued to advocate Tunisian independence. He also traveled around Europe, East Asia, the Middle East, and the United States, attempting to win supporters to his cause and demonstrating the pragmatic, nonaligned diplomacy that would serve him so well in his later life.

With strikes and demonstrations in favour of independence at home and the French determined to protect the interests of their settlers, tensions mounted. Bourguiba was arrested again in 1952 and detained, first in Tunisia and later in France. In 1954, however, as Tunisian nationalists turned to terrorism, the French government began negotiations with Bourguiba, recognizing Tunisia’s internal autonomy as a first step. A new government, which included the Neo-Destour, was formed with the express purpose of negotiating an end to French rule. The first stage was completed in June 1955 when the internal autonomy convention was signed, limiting French control to matters of defense and foreign affairs.

Hastings Kamuzu Banda
Hastings Kamuzu Banda, (born c. 1898, near
Kasungu, British Central Africa Protectorate [now
Malawi]—died Nov. 25, 1997, Johannesburg, S.Af.),
first president of Malawi (formerly Nyasaland) and
the principal leader of the Malawi nationalist
movement. He governed Malawi from 1963 to 1994,
combining totalitarian political controls with
conservative economic policies.
Banda’s birthday was officially given as May 14, 1906, but he was believed to have been
born before the turn of the century. He was the son of subsistence farmers and received his
earliest education in a mission school. After working in Southern Rhodesia (now
Zimbabwe) and South Africa, in 1925 he went to the United States, where he received a
B.A. (1931) and a medical degree (1937) at the University of Chicago and Meharry
Medical College in Tennessee, respectively. In order to achieve the qualifications needed to
practice in the British Empire, Banda then continued his studies at the University of
Edinburgh (1941) and subsequently practiced in northern England and London from 1945
to 1953.
Banda first became involved in his homeland’s politics in the late 1940s, when white
settlers in the region demanded the federation of the Rhodesias and Nyasaland. Banda and
others in Nyasaland strongly objected to this extension of white dominance, but the
Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland was nevertheless established in 1953. In 1953–58
Banda practiced medicine in Ghana, but from 1956 he was under increasing pressure from
Nyasa nationalists to return; he finally did so, to a tumultuous welcome, in 1958. As
president of the Nyasaland African Congress, he toured the country making antifederation
speeches, and the colonial government held him partly responsible for increasing African
resentment and disturbances. In March 1959 a state of emergency was declared, and he was
imprisoned by the British colonial authorities. He was released in April 1960, and a few
months later he accepted British constitutional proposals granting Africans in Nyasaland a
majority in the Legislative Council. Banda’s party won the general elections held in August
1961. He served as minister of natural resources and local government in 1961–63, and he
became prime minister in 1963, the year the federation was finally dissolved. He retained

the post of prime minister when Nyasaland achieved independence in 1964 under the name
of Malawi.
Shortly after independence, some members of Banda’s governing cabinet resigned in
protest against his autocratic methods and his accommodation with South Africa and the
Portuguese colonies. In 1965 a rebellion broke out—led by Henry Chipembere, one of
these former ministers—but it failed to take hold in the countryside. Malawi became a
republic in 1966, with Banda as president. He headed an austere, autocratic one-party
regime, maintained firm control over all aspects of the government, and jailed or executed
his opponents. He was declared president for life in 1971. Banda concentrated on building
up his country’s infrastructure and increasing agricultural productivity. He established
friendly trading relations with minority-ruled South Africa (to the disappointment of other
African leaders) as well as with other countries in the region through which landlocked
Malawi’s overseas trade had to pass. His foreign-policy orientation was decidedly pro-
Western.
Widespread domestic protests and the withdrawal of Western financial aid forced Banda to
legalize other political parties in 1993. He was voted out of office in the country’s first
multiparty presidential elections, held in 1994, and in 1996 he relinquished the leadership
of the Malawi Congress Party.

In March 1959 a state of emergency was declared, and he was imprisoned by the British colonial authorities. He was released in April 1960, and a few months later he accepted British constitutional proposals granting Africans in Nyasaland a majority in the Legislative Council. Banda’s party won the general elections held in August 1961. He served as minister of natural resources and local government in 1961–63, and he became prime minister in 1963, the year the federation was finally dissolved. He retained  Hastings Kamuzu Banda   the post of prime minister when Nyasaland achieved independence in 1964 under the name of Malawi. Shortly after independence, some members of Banda’s governing cabinet resigned in protest against his autocratic methods and his accommodation with South Africa and the Portuguese colonies. In 1965 a rebellion broke out—led by Henry Chipembere, one of these former ministers—but it failed to take hold in the countryside. Malawi became a republic in 1966, with Banda as president. He headed an austere, autocratic one-party regime, maintained firm control over all aspects of the government, and jailed or executed his opponents. He was declared president for life in 1971. Banda concentrated on building up his country’s infrastructure and increasing agricultural productivity. He established friendly trading relations with minority-ruled South Africa (to the disappointment of other African leaders) as well as with other countries in the region through which landlocked Malawi’s overseas trade had to pass. His foreign-policy orientation was decidedly pro- Western. Widespread domestic protests and the withdrawal of Western financial aid forced Banda to legalize other political parties in 1993. He was voted out of office in the country’s first multiparty presidential elections, held in 1994, and in 1996 he relinquished the leadership of the Malawi Congress Party.

Hendricus Sneevliet
Hendricus Sneevliet, in full Hendricus Josephus Franciscus Marie Sneevliet, (born
May 13, 1883, Rotterdam, Neth.—died April 13, 1942, Amersfoort), Dutch communist
politician who founded the Indies Social Democratic Association in the Dutch East Indies
(now Indonesia) and whose oratory stimulated the nationalist movement there.
Sneevliet began working for the Dutch railroads and by 1909 was president of the Union of
Rail and Tram Employees. He also was involved with the Social Democratic Workers
Party. After a disagreement with other union leaders, he went to the East Indies (1912),
where he wrote for the Soerabajaasch Handelsblad (“Surabaya Trade Journal”) and served
as secretary to a trade company in Semarang, then the centre of radicalism in the East
Indies.
Sneevliet then devoted his life to the Indonesian nationalist movement. In 1914 he founded
the Social Democratic Association, whose members were socialists of varying degrees of
radicalism. After the party split in 1917, Sneevliet led its more revolutionary wing. His
party gained a strong hold over the Semarang railway union, and its members worked their
way into the Sarekat Islām (a powerful Muslim party with nationalist aims). An
inflammatory orator, Sneevliet was deported from the East Indies in 1917 because of his
revolutionary activities.
On returning to Europe, Sneevliet was employed by the Communist International. After
1924 he limited his activities to the Netherlands, where he founded the Revolutionary
Socialist Party in 1929 and sat in Parliament as one of its representatives from 1933 to
1937. The Germans executed him in 1942.

Canadian nationalism, and founder of the Montreal
newspaper Le Devoir (1910).
Bourassa studied law but built a reputation as a writer on political affairs. He became
mayor of Montebello, Labelle County, Que., in 1890 and represented Labelle in the federal
House of Commons as a Liberal (1896–1907). In 1899 he resigned in protest against
Canadian support of the imperialist cause in South Africa, but, as the accredited leader of

Bourassa proposed that Canada should become a completely separate nation under the
crown, and he cooperated with the Conservatives in opposing U.S. capital investment in his
country. From 1908 to 1912 he was a member of the Quebec Legislature, where he
opposed the Liberals. He also campaigned against conscription, introduced by the
Conservatives in 1917.
In 1925 Bourassa was reelected by Labelle to the federal Parliament as an independent, and
the following year he allied with Prime Minister W.L. Mackenzie King in demanding a

Henry Christophe
Henry Christophe, (born Oct. 6, 1767, Grenada?—died Oct. 8, 1820, Milot, Haiti), a
leader in the war of Haitian independence (1791–1804) and later president (1807–11) and
self-proclaimed King Henry I (1811–20) of northern Haiti.
The facts of Christophe’s early life are questionable and confused. An official document
issued on his own order gives the birth date and birthplace conventionally cited, but these
and other facts are debated by historians. He may have been born free but been enslaved as
a youth. In any event, he reached Haiti sometime in his teens. In 1780, during the American
Revolution, he may have fought in a French unit at Savannah, Georgia, either as an enlistee
or as the property of a French naval officer. He returned to Haiti and apparently worked
initially as a domestic in an inn called the Couronne, working his way up and marrying the
proprietor’s daughter. (Another story has him marrying the French naval officer’s daughter
after buying his freedom.)
After the spirit of the French Revolution spread to Haiti, Christophe in 1793 openly
embraced the party of the Haitian independence leader Toussaint Louverture and became
one of his chief lieutenants, fighting the French, the British, and the Spaniards. The French
attempted to reconquer the colony in 1801, but Christophe held out until 1802,
surrendering only on the promise of a pardon and retention of his military rank in the
French army. He later joined Jean-Jacques Dessalines in ousting the French and
commanded the army under that ruler. After Dessalines’s assassination he was appointed
provisional chief of the nation by a military council. Although he thought despotism the
only form of government for his people, he summoned a constituent assembly on Dec. 18,
1806.
Alexandre Sabès Pétion, Christophe’s only rival for power, secured control in the south and
west and thereby secured majority representation in the assembly. He was appointed
chairman to draft a constitution, which in its final form made Christophe little more than a
figurehead. In retaliation, Christophe led his troops against Pétion but was defeated on Jan.
6, 1807, and he retreated north.
In northern Haiti, Christophe set up his own domain, which he ruled as King Henry I from
1811 and for which he created a hereditary nobility comprising 4 princes, 8 dukes, 22
counts, 37 barons, and 14 knights. He established an elaborate dress code and court
ceremony and built himself eight palaces and six châteaus. During his reign he distributed

plantations to military chiefs, restored soldier peasants to their former occupations, and
maintained a general prosperity. He built the famous Citadelle Laferrière, a fortress south
of his capital at Cap-Haïtien. In August 1820 he suffered a paralytic stroke. When his
condition was learned, revolts broke out. In despair over his failure to pacify the country,
he shot himself at Sans-Souci palace (the citadel and palace were designated UNESCO
World Heritage sites in 1982), and his kingdom became part of the Haitian republic in
1821.

Henry Flood
Henry Flood, (born 1732—died Dec. 2, 1791,
Farmley, County Kilkenny, Ire.), Anglo-Irish
statesman, founder of the Patriot movement that in
1782 won legislative independence for Ireland.
The illegitimate son of Warden Flood, chief justice of
the Court of King’s Bench in Ireland, Henry entered
the Irish Parliament in 1759. Irish Protestants were becoming impatient with the British
Parliament’s right to legislate for Ireland over the wishes of the Irish Parliament. Moreover,
the British government controlled a majority in Ireland’s House of Commons through the
distribution of crown patronage by the owners of parliamentary boroughs. Flood’s
outstanding oratorical powers soon enabled him to create a small but effective opposition
inside the Irish Parliament that agitated for political reforms. They demanded provisions for
new Irish parliamentary elections every eight years (instead of merely at the start of a new
British king’s reign). Their long-range goal was legislative independence. In 1768 Flood’s
Patriots engineered passage of a bill limiting the duration of Parliament to eight years, and
in 1769 and 1771 they defeated measures to grant funds for the British administration in
Ireland.
Although Flood had become the first independent Irish statesman, he sacrificed this
position in 1775 by accepting the office of vice treasurer under the British viceroy, Lord
Harcourt. Henry Grattan, an even greater orator than Flood, replaced him as leader of the
Patriots. (Grattan described Flood as a man “with a metaphor in his mouth and a bribe in
his pocket.”) Flood had, however, left the Patriot cause at the wrong time; the movement
grew rapidly as more and more Irish people were influenced by the North American
colonists who were rebelling against the British in the American Revolution (1775–83). In
1779 Flood rejoined his old party, and two years later he was officially dismissed from his
government post. Although Flood had lost his following, he helped Grattan force the
British government to renounce its restrictions on Irish trade (1779) and grant legislative
independence to Ireland (1782). Flood then decided to challenge Grattan’s leadership.
Charging that Grattan had not gone far enough in his reforms, Flood obtained passage of a
measure requiring the British Parliament to renounce all claims to control of Irish
legislation. Nevertheless, Flood’s newly acquired popularity was destroyed upon the defeat
of his attempt to reform the Irish Parliament in 1784. From 1783 until his retirement in

Irish Parliament in December 1775, soon after Flood had forfeited the movement’s
leadership by accepting government office. Grattan’s brilliant oratory soon made him the
leading spokesman of the parliamentary agitation. His movement gained momentum as
more and more Irish people came to sympathize with the North American colonists in their
war for independence from Great Britain (American Revolution). By 1779 he was powerful
enough to persuade the British government to remove most of its restraints on Irish trade,
and in April 1780 he formally demanded the repeal of Poynings’ Law, which had made all
legislation passed by the Irish Parliament subject to approval by the British Parliament.
Two years later the British—again in response to Grattan’s demands and to pressure from
the Irish Volunteers, a militia organized to defend Ireland against possible French invasion
—relinquished their right to legislate for Ireland and freed the Irish Parliament from
subservience to the English Privy Council. Despite these successes, Grattan soon faced
rivalry from Flood, who bitterly criticized Grattan for failing to demand that the British
Parliament completely renounce all claims to control of Irish legislation. Flood succeeded
in undermining Grattan’s popularity, but by 1784 Flood himself had lost much of his
following.
From 1782 to 1797 Grattan made limited progress in his struggle to reform the composition
of the Irish Parliament and to win voting rights for Ireland’s Roman Catholics. The
outbreak of the French Revolution (1789) bolstered his cause by infusing democratic ideas
into Ireland, but the subsequent growth of a radical Irish movement for Catholic
emancipation provoked repressive measures by the British. Grattan was caught between the
two sides. Ill and discouraged, he retired from Parliament in May 1797 and was in England
when the Irish radicals staged an unsuccessful rebellion (1798). He returned to Parliament
for five months in 1800 and waged a vigorous but fruitless campaign against Prime
Minister William Pitt’s plans for the legislative union of the Irish and British parliaments.

Ho Chi Minh
Ho Chi Minh, original name Nguyen Sinh Cung,
also called Nguyen Tat Thanh or Nguyen Ai Quoc,
(born May 19, 1890, Hoang Tru, Vietnam, French
Indochina—died September 2, 1969, Hanoi, North
Vietnam), founder of the Indochina Communist Party
(1930) and its successor, the Viet-Minh (1941), and
president from 1945 to 1969 of the Democratic
Republic of Vietnam (North Vietnam). As the leader of the Vietnamese nationalist
movement for nearly three decades, Ho was one of the prime movers of the post-World
War II anti-colonial movement in Asia and one of the most influential communist leaders
of the 20th century.
Early life
The son of a poor country scholar, Nguyen Sinh Huy, Ho Chi Minh was brought up in the
village of Kim Lien. He had a wretched childhood, but between the ages of 14 and 18 he
was able to study at a grammar school in Hue. He is next known to have been a
schoolmaster in Phan Thiet and then was apprenticed at a technical institute in Saigon.
In 1911, under the name of Ba, he found work as a cook on a French steamer. He was a
seaman for more than three years, visiting various African ports and the American cities of
Boston and New York. After living in London from 1915 to 1917, he moved to France,
where he worked, in turn, as a gardener, sweeper, waiter, photo retoucher, and oven stoker.
During the six years that he spent in France (1917–23), he became an active socialist under
the name Nguyen Ai Quoc (“Nguyen the Patriot”). He organized a group of Vietnamese
living there and in 1919 addressed an eight-point petition to the representatives of the great
powers at the Versailles Peace Conference that concluded World War I. In the petition, Ho
demanded that the French colonial power grant its subjects in Indochina equal rights with
the rulers. This act brought no response from the peacemakers, but it made him a hero to
many politically conscious Vietnamese. The following year, inspired by the success of the
communist revolution in Russia and Vladimir Lenin’s anti-imperialist doctrine, Ho joined
the French Communists when they withdrew from the Socialist Party in December 1920.
After his years of militant activity in France, where he became acquainted with most of the
French working-class leaders, Ho went to Moscow at the end of 1923. In January 1924,

following the death of Lenin, he published a moving farewell to the founder of the Soviet
Union in Pravda. Six months later, from June 17 to July 8, he took an active part in the
Fifth Congress of the Communist International, during which he criticized the French
Communist Party for not opposing colonialism more vigorously. His statement to the
congress is noteworthy because it contains the first formulation of his belief in the
importance of the revolutionary role of oppressed peasants (as opposed to industrial
workers).
In December 1924, under the assumed name of Ly Thuy, Ho went to Canton (Guangzhou),
a communist stronghold, where he recruited the first cadres of the Vietnamese nationalist
movement, organizing them into the Vietnam Thanh Nien Cach Menh Dong Chi Hoi
(“Vietnamese Revolutionary Youth Association”), which became famous under the name
Thanh Nien. Almost all of its members had been exiled from Indochina because of their
political beliefs and had gathered together in order to participate in the struggle against
French rule over their country. Thus, Canton became the first home of Indochinese
nationalism.
When Chiang Kai-shek, then commander of the Chinese army, expelled the Chinese
communists from Canton in April 1927, Ho again sought refuge in the Soviet Union. In
1928 he went to Brussels and Paris and then to Siam (now Thailand), where he spent two
years as a representative of the Communist International, the world organization of
communist parties, in Southeast Asia. His followers, however, remained in South China.
Founding of the Indochinese Communist Party
Meeting in Hong Kong in May 1929, members of the Thanh Nien decided to form the
Indochinese Communist Party (PCI). Others—in the Vietnamese cities of Hanoi, Hue, and
Saigon—began the actual work of organization, but some of Ho’s lieutenants were
reluctant to act in the absence of their leader, who had the confidence of Moscow. Ho was
brought back from Siam, therefore, and on February 3, 1930, he presided over the founding
of the party. At first it was called the Vietnamese Communist Party, but, after October
1930, Ho, acting on Soviet advice, adopted the name Indochinese Communist Party. In this
phase of his career, Ho acted more as an arbiter of conflicts among the various factions,
allowing the organization of revolutionary action, rather than as an initiator. His prudence,
his awareness of what it was possible to accomplish, his care not to alienate Moscow, and
the influence that he already had achieved among the Vietnamese Communists can be seen
in these actions.

The creation of the PCI coincided with a violent insurrectionary movement in Vietnam.
Repression by the French was brutal; Ho himself was condemned in absentia to death as a
revolutionary. He sought refuge in Hong Kong, where the French police obtained
permission from the British for his extradition, but friends helped him escape, and he
reached Moscow via Shanghai.
In 1935 the Seventh Congress of the International, meeting in Moscow, which he attended
as chief delegate for the PCI, officially sanctioned the idea of the Popular Front (an alliance
with the noncommunist left against fascism)—a policy Ho had advocated for some time. In
keeping with this policy, the Communists in Indochina moderated their anti-colonialist
stance in 1936, allowing for cooperation with “antifascist colonialists.” The formation of
Premier Léon Blum’s Popular Front government in France in the same year allowed leftist
forces in Indochina to operate more freely, although Ho, because of his condemnation in
1930, was not permitted to return from exile. Repression returned to Indochina with the fall
of the Blum government in 1937, and by 1938 the Popular Front was dead.
World War II and the founding of the Vietnamese state
In 1938 Ho returned to China and stayed for a few months with Mao Zedong at Yen-an.
When France was defeated by Germany in 1940, Ho and his lieutenants, Vo Nguyen Giap
and Pham Van Dong, plotted to use this turn of events to advance their own cause. About
this time he began to use the name Ho Chi Minh (“He Who Enlightens”). Crossing over the
border into Vietnam in January 1941, the trio and five comrades organized in May the Viet
Nam Doc Lap Dong Minh Hoi (League for the Independence of Vietnam), or Viet Minh;
this gave renewed emphasis to a peculiarly Vietnamese nationalism.
The new organization was forced to seek help in China from the government of Chiang
Kai-shek. But Chiang distrusted Ho as a Communist and had him arrested. Ho was then
imprisoned in China for 18 months, during which time he wrote his famed Notebook from
Prison (a collection of short poems written in classic Chinese, a mixture of melancholy,
stoicism, and a call for revolution). His friends obtained his release by an arrangement with
Chiang Fa-k’uei, a warlord in South China, agreeing in return to support Chiang’s interests
in Indochina against the French.
In 1945 two events occurred that paved the way to power for the Vietnamese
revolutionaries. First, the Japanese completely overran Indochina and imprisoned or
executed all French officials. Six months later the United States dropped the atomic bomb

on Hiroshima, and the Japanese were totally defeated. Thus, the two strongest adversaries
of the Viet Minh and Ho Chi Minh were eliminated.
Ho Chi Minh seized his opportunity. Within a few months he contacted U.S. forces and
began to collaborate with the Office of Strategic Services (OSS; a U.S. undercover
operation) against the Japanese. Further, his Viet Minh guerrillas fought against the
Japanese in the mountains of South China.
At the same time, commandos formed by Vo Nguyen Giap, under Ho’s direction, began to
move toward Hanoi, the Vietnamese capital, in the spring of 1945. After Japan’s surrender
to the Allies, they entered Hanoi on August 19. Finally, on September 2, before an
enormous crowd gathered in Ba Dinh Square, Ho Chi Minh declared Vietnam independent,
using words ironically reminiscent of the U.S. Declaration of Independence: “All men are
born equal: the Creator has given us inviolable rights, life, liberty, and happiness…!”
All obstacles were not removed from the path of the Viet Minh, however. According to the
terms of an Allied agreement, Chiang Kai-shek’s troops were supposed to replace the
Japanese north of the 16th parallel. More significantly, France, now liberated and under the
leadership of Charles de Gaulle, did not intend to simply accept the fait accompli of an
independent Vietnam and attempted to reassert its control. On October 6 the French general
Jacques Leclerc landed in Saigon, followed a few days later by a strong armoured division.
Within three months he had control of South Vietnam. Ho had to choose between
continuing the fight or negotiating. He chose negotiations, but not without preparing for an
eventual transition to war.
Ho Chi Minh’s strategy was to get the French to make the Chinese in the north withdraw
and then to work for a treaty with France in which recognition of independence, evacuation
of Leclerc’s forces, and reunification of the country would be assured. Negotiations began
in late October 1945, but the French refused to speak of independence, and Ho was caught
in a stalemate. In March the deadlock was broken: on his side, Ho Chi Minh allowed
parties other than the Viet Minh to be included in the new government, in an attempt to
gain a wider base of support for the demands made on the French, and, at the same time,
the French sent a diplomatic mission to China to obtain the evacuation of the Chinese
soldiers. This was done, and some of Leclerc’s troops were also removed from Haiphong,
in the north. Having secured the withdrawal of the Chinese, Ho signed an agreement with
the French on March 6. According to its terms, Vietnam was recognized as a “free state
with its own government, army, and finances,” but it was integrated into a French Union in

Vietnam (1954–76)
which Paris continued to play the key role. Twelve days later Leclerc entered Hanoi with a
few battalions, which were to be confined to a restricted area.
The First Indochina War
The agreement was unsatisfactory to extremists on both sides, and Ho Chi Minh went to
France for a series of conferences (June to September 1946) and concluded a second
agreement with the French government. But the peace was broken by an incident at
Haiphong (November 20–23, 1946), when a French cruiser opened fire on the town after a
clash between French and Vietnamese soldiers. Almost 6,000 Vietnamese were killed, and
hope for an amicable settlement ended. Sick and disillusioned, Ho Chi Minh was not able
to oppose demands for retaliation by his more militant followers, and the First Indochina
War began on December 19.
After a few months, Ho, who had sought refuge in a remote area of North Vietnam,
attempted to reestablish contact with Paris, but the terms he was offered were unacceptable.
In 1948 the French offered to return the former Annamese (Vietnamese) emperor Bao Dai,
who had abdicated in favour of the revolution in August 1945. These terms were more
favourable than those offered to Ho Chi Minh two years earlier, because the French were
now attempting to weaken the Viet Minh by supporting the traditional ruling class in
Vietnam. But this policy was not successful. The Viet Minh army, commanded by Giap,
was able to contain the French and Bao Dai’s forces with guerrilla tactics and terrorism,
and by the end of 1953 most of the countryside was under Viet Minh control, with the
larger cities under a virtual state of siege. The French were decisively defeated at Dien
Bien Phu on May 7, 1954, and had no choice but to negotiate.
The Geneva Accords and the Second Indochina War
From May to July 21, 1954, representatives of eight
countries—with Vietnam represented by two
delegations, one composed of supporters of Ho Chi
Minh, the other of supporters of Bao Dai—met in
Geneva to find a solution. They concluded with an
agreement according to which Vietnam was to be
divided at the 17th parallel until elections, scheduled
for 1956, after which the Vietnamese would establish a unified government.
It is difficult to assess Ho’s role in the Geneva negotiations. He was represented by Pham
Van Dong, a faithful associate. The moderation exhibited by the Viet Minh in accepting a

partition of the country and in accepting control of less territory than they had conquered
during the war follows the pattern established by the man who had signed the 1946
agreements with France. But this flexibility, which was also a response to pressures exerted
by the Russians and Chinese, did not achieve everything for the Viet Minh. Hanoi lost out
because the elections that were to guarantee the country’s reunification were postponed
indefinitely by the United States and by South Vietnam, which was created on a de facto
basis at this time.
North Vietnam, where Ho and his associates were established, was a poor country, cut off
from the vast agricultural areas of the south. Its leaders were forced to ask for assistance
from their larger communist allies, China and the Soviet Union. In these adverse conditions
Ho Chi Minh’s regime became repressive and rigidly totalitarian. Attempted agricultural
reforms in 1955–56 were conducted with ignorant brutality and repression. “Uncle” Ho, as
he had become known to the North Vietnamese, was able to preserve his immense
popularity, but he abandoned a kind of humane quality that had distinguished some of his
previous revolutionary activities despite ruthless purges of Trotskyists and bourgeois
nationalists in 1945–46.
The old statesman had better luck in the field of diplomacy. He traveled to Moscow and
Beijing (1955) and to New Delhi and Jakarta (1958), skillfully maintaining a balance
between his powerful communist allies and even, at the time of his journey to Moscow in
1960, acting as a mediator between them. Linked by old habit, and perhaps by preference,
to the Soviet Union but aware of the seminal role China had played in the revolution in
Asia, preoccupied with using his relations with Moscow to lessen China’s influence in
Asia, and, above all, careful to assert Vietnamese rights, Ho Chi Minh skillfully maintained
a balance between the two communist giants. When the war was resumed, he obtained an
equal amount of aid from both.
Beginning about 1959, North Vietnam again became involved in war. Guerrillas, popularly
known as the Vietcong, were conducting an armed revolt against the U.S.-sponsored
regime of Ngo Dinh Diem in South Vietnam. Their leaders, veterans of the Viet Minh,
appealed to North Vietnam for aid. In July 1959, at a meeting of the central committee of
Ho Chi Minh’s Lao Dong (Worker’s Party), it was decided that the establishment of
socialism in the North was linked with the unification with the South. This policy was
confirmed by the third congress of the Lao Dong, held shortly thereafter in Hanoi. During
the congress, Ho Chi Minh ceded his position as the party’s secretary-general to Le Duan.
He remained chief of state, but, from this point on, his activity was largely behind the

scenes. Ho certainly continued to have enormous influence in the government, which was
dominated by his old followers Pham Van Dong, Truong Chinh, Vo Nguyen Giap, and Le
Duan, but he was less actively involved, becoming more and more a symbol to the people.
His public personality, which had never been the object of a cult comparable to that of
Joseph Stalin, Mao, or even Josip Broz Tito, is best symbolized by his popular name, Uncle
Ho. He stood for the essential unity of the divided Vietnamese family.
This role, which he played with skill, did not prevent him from taking a position in the
conflict ravaging his country, especially after American air strikes against the North began
in 1965. On July 17, 1966, he sent a message to the people (“nothing is as dear to the heart
of the Vietnamese as independence and liberation”) that became the motto of the North
Vietnamese cause. On February 15, 1967, in response to a personal message from U.S.
President Lyndon Johnson, he announced: “We will never agree to negotiate under the
threat of bombing.” Ho lived to see only the beginning of a long round of negotiations
before he died. The removal of this powerful leader undoubtedly damaged chances for an
early settlement.
Ho Chi Minh’s importance
Among 20th-century revolutionaries, Ho waged the longest and most costly battle against
the colonial system of the great powers. One of its effects was to cause a grave crisis in the
national life of the mightiest of capitalist countries, the United States. As a Marxist, Ho
stands with the Yugoslav leader Tito as one of the progenitors of the “national
communism” that developed in the 1960s and (at least partially) with communist China’s
Mao Zedong in emphasizing the role of the peasantry in the revolutionary struggle.
Most of Ho Chi Minh’s writings are collected in the two-volume Selected Works, published
in Hanoi in 1960, in the series of Foreign Language Editions.

published in Hanoi in 1960, in the series of Foreign Language Editions.', 'Jean Lacouture']","Ho Chi Minh Ho Chi Minh, original name Nguyen Sinh Cung, also called Nguyen Tat Thanh or Nguyen Ai Quoc, (born May 19, 1890, Hoang Tru, Vietnam, French Indochina—died September 2, 1969, Hanoi, North Vietnam), founder of the Indochina Communist Party (1930) and its successor, the Viet-Minh (1941), and president from 1945 to 1969 of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam (North Vietnam). As the leader of the Vietnamese nationalist movement for nearly three decades, Ho was one of the prime movers of the post-World War II anti-colonial movement in Asia and one of the most influential communist leaders of the 20th century. Early life The son of a poor country scholar, Nguyen Sinh Huy, Ho Chi Minh was brought up in the village of Kim Lien. He had a wretched childhood, but between the ages of 14 and 18 he was able to study at a grammar school in Hue. He is next known to have been a schoolmaster in Phan Thiet and then was apprenticed at a technical institute in Saigon. In 1911, under the name of Ba, he found work as a cook on a French steamer. He was a seaman for more than three years, visiting various African ports and the American cities of Boston and New York. After living in London from 1915 to 1917, he moved to France, where he worked, in turn, as a gardener, sweeper, waiter, photo retoucher, and oven stoker. During the six years that he spent in France (1917–23), he became an active socialist under the name Nguyen Ai Quoc (“Nguyen the Patriot”). He organized a group of Vietnamese living there and in 1919 addressed an eight-point petition to the representatives of the great powers at the Versailles Peace Conference that concluded World War I. In the petition, Ho demanded that the French colonial power grant its subjects in Indochina equal rights with the rulers. This act brought no response from the peacemakers, but it made him a hero to many politically conscious Vietnamese. The following year, inspired by the success of the communist revolution in Russia and Vladimir Lenin’s anti-imperialist doctrine, Ho joined the French Communists when they withdrew from the Socialist Party in December 1920. After his years of militant activity in France, where he became acquainted with most of the French working-class leaders, Ho went to Moscow at the end of 1923. In January 1924,  Ho Chi Minh   following the death of Lenin, he published a moving farewell to the founder of the Soviet Union in Pravda. Six months later, from June 17 to July 8, he took an active part in the Fifth Congress of the Communist International, during which he criticized the French Communist Party for not opposing colonialism more vigorously. His statement to the congress is noteworthy because it contains the first formulation of his belief in the importance of the revolutionary role of oppressed peasants (as opposed to industrial workers). In December 1924, under the assumed name of Ly Thuy, Ho went to Canton (Guangzhou), a communist stronghold, where he recruited the first cadres of the Vietnamese nationalist movement, organizing them into the Vietnam Thanh Nien Cach Menh Dong Chi Hoi (“Vietnamese Revolutionary Youth Association”), which became famous under the name Thanh Nien. Almost all of its members had been exiled from Indochina because of their political beliefs and had gathered together in order to participate in the struggle against French rule over their country. Thus, Canton became the first home of Indochinese nationalism. When Chiang Kai-shek, then commander of the Chinese army, expelled the Chinese communists from Canton in April 1927, Ho again sought refuge in the Soviet Union. In 1928 he went to Brussels and Paris and then to Siam (now Thailand), where he spent two years as a representative of the Communist International, the world organization of communist parties, in Southeast Asia. His followers, however, remained in South China. Founding of the Indochinese Communist Party Meeting in Hong Kong in May 1929, members of the Thanh Nien decided to form the Indochinese Communist Party (PCI). Others—in the Vietnamese cities of Hanoi, Hue, and Saigon—began the actual work of organization, but some of Ho’s lieutenants were reluctant to act in the absence of their leader, who had the confidence of Moscow. Ho was brought back from Siam, therefore, and on February 3, 1930, he presided over the founding of the party. At first it was called the Vietnamese Communist Party, but, after October 1930, Ho, acting on Soviet advice, adopted the name Indochinese Communist Party. In this phase of his career, Ho acted more as an arbiter of conflicts among the various factions, allowing the organization of revolutionary action, rather than as an initiator. His prudence, his awareness of what it was possible to accomplish, his care not to alienate Moscow, and the influence that he already had achieved among the Vietnamese Communists can be seen in these actions. Ho Chi Minh   The creation of the PCI coincided with a violent insurrectionary movement in Vietnam. Repression by the French was brutal; Ho himself was condemned in absentia to death as a revolutionary. He sought refuge in Hong Kong, where the French police obtained permission from the British for his extradition, but friends helped him escape, and he reached Moscow via Shanghai. In 1935 the Seventh Congress of the International, meeting in Moscow, which he attended as chief delegate for the PCI, officially sanctioned the idea of the Popular Front (an alliance with the noncommunist left against fascism)—a policy Ho had advocated for some time. In keeping with this policy, the Communists in Indochina moderated their anti-colonialist stance in 1936, allowing for cooperation with “antifascist colonialists.” The formation of Premier Léon Blum’s Popular Front government in France in the same year allowed leftist forces in Indochina to operate more freely, although Ho, because of his condemnation in 1930, was not permitted to return from exile. Repression returned to Indochina with the fall of the Blum government in 1937, and by 1938 the Popular Front was dead. World War II and the founding of the Vietnamese state In 1938 Ho returned to China and stayed for a few months with Mao Zedong at Yen-an. When France was defeated by Germany in 1940, Ho and his lieutenants, Vo Nguyen Giap and Pham Van Dong, plotted to use this turn of events to advance their own cause. About this time he began to use the name Ho Chi Minh (“He Who Enlightens”). Crossing over the border into Vietnam in January 1941, the trio and five comrades organized in May the Viet Nam Doc Lap Dong Minh Hoi (League for the Independence of Vietnam), or Viet Minh; this gave renewed emphasis to a peculiarly Vietnamese nationalism. The new organization was forced to seek help in China from the government of Chiang Kai-shek. But Chiang distrusted Ho as a Communist and had him arrested. Ho was then imprisoned in China for 18 months, during which time he wrote his famed Notebook from Prison (a collection of short poems written in classic Chinese, a mixture of melancholy, stoicism, and a call for revolution). His friends obtained his release by an arrangement with Chiang Fa-k’uei, a warlord in South China, agreeing in return to support Chiang’s interests in Indochina against the French. In 1945 two events occurred that paved the way to power for the Vietnamese revolutionaries. First, the Japanese completely overran Indochina and imprisoned or executed all French officials. Six months later the United States dropped the atomic bomb  Ho Chi Minh   on Hiroshima, and the Japanese were totally defeated. Thus, the two strongest adversaries of the Viet Minh and Ho Chi Minh were eliminated. Ho Chi Minh seized his opportunity. Within a few months he contacted U.S. forces and began to collaborate with the Office of Strategic Services (OSS; a U.S. undercover operation) against the Japanese. Further, his Viet Minh guerrillas fought against the Japanese in the mountains of South China. At the same time, commandos formed by Vo Nguyen Giap, under Ho’s direction, began to move toward Hanoi, the Vietnamese capital, in the spring of 1945. After Japan’s surrender to the Allies, they entered Hanoi on August 19.

Houari Boumedienne
Houari Boumedienne, original name Mohammed Ben Brahim Boukharouba, (born
Aug. 23, 1927, Clauzel, near Guelma, Alg.—died Dec. 27, 1978, Algiers), army officer
who became president of Algeria in July 1965 following a coup d’etat.
Boukharouba’s service to Algeria began in the 1950s, during his country’s struggle for
independence from France, when, after studying at al-Azhar University in Cairo, he joined
the rebel forces and adopted the name Houari Boumedienne. The rebels divided the country
into military districts, and Boumedienne commanded the one around Oran. In 1960 he
became chief of staff of the National Liberation Front, and he centred his efforts on raising
an Algerian army in Morocco and Tunisia, out of reach of the French.
After a peace treaty was signed with France in March 1962, tension among the Algerian
leaders increased, and that September Boumedienne occupied Algiers in support of Ahmed
Ben Bella. Ben Bella became president later in the year, and Boumedienne was named
minister of defense and vice president. Conflicts developed between the two leaders, and in
June 1965 Boumedienne effected a coup against Ben Bella and installed himself as
president. Boumedienne lacked widespread popular support, and he governed at first
through a 26-member revolutionary council. As a result his leadership was weak and
indecisive, but after an attempt by military officers to overthrow his regime failed in
December 1967, he asserted his direct and undisputed leadership of Algeria.
In 1971 he imposed state control on the oil industry, at the cost of ending Algeria’s special
relationship with France. He risked war with Morocco in 1975 by trying to gain territorial
access to the Atlantic across the Spanish Sahara (later Western Sahara). In 1976 his
government issued a National Charter and then a new constitution, both adopted by
referendum. Negotiating important industrial contracts with Western countries and at the
same time maintaining close but independent relations with the Soviet bloc, Boumedienne
became a leading figure in the nonaligned movement.

In 1960 he became chief of staff of the National Liberation Front, and he centred his efforts on raising an Algerian army in Morocco and Tunisia, out of reach of the French. After a peace treaty was signed with France in March 1962, tension among the Algerian leaders increased, and that September Boumedienne occupied Algiers in support of Ahmed Ben Bella. Ben Bella became president later in the year, and Boumedienne was named minister of defense and vice president. Conflicts developed between the two leaders, and in June 1965 Boumedienne effected a coup against Ben Bella and installed himself as president. Boumedienne lacked widespread popular support, and he governed at first through a 26-member revolutionary council. As a result his leadership was weak and indecisive, but after an attempt by military officers to overthrow his regime failed in December 1967, he asserted his direct and undisputed leadership of Algeria. In 1971 he imposed state control on the oil industry, at the cost of ending Algeria’s special relationship with France. He risked war with Morocco in 1975 by trying to gain territorial access to the Atlantic across the Spanish Sahara (later Western Sahara). In 1976 his government issued a National Charter and then a new constitution, both adopted by referendum. Negotiating important industrial contracts with Western countries and at the same time maintaining close but independent relations with the Soviet bloc, Boumedienne became a leading figure in the nonaligned movement.

Hugo Kołłątaj
Hugo Kołłątaj, (born April 1, 1750, Doderkały
Wielkie, Volhynia, Pol.—died Feb. 28, 1812, Warsaw),
Polish Roman Catholic priest, reformer, and politician
who was prominent in the movement for national
regeneration in the years following the First Partition of
Poland (1772).
After studying in Kraków, Vienna, and Rome, Kołłątaj returned home in 1775 to play a
leading part in the new Commission for National Education (1773), especially in reforming
the ancient University of Kraków, of which he became rector (1782–86). Given an
administrative post, he devoted his abilities to preparing, with a group of intellectual and
political followers, a program of reform to guide the Four Years’ Sejm (1788–92) in its task
of reconstructing Polish social and political institutions. The ideas that he put forward
underlay the constitution of May 3, 1791, whereby the middle class was accorded a role in
public affairs. He was then appointed vice-chancellor. Deprived of authority after the defeat
of the Poles by the Russians in 1792, he went into exile to Leipzig and Dresden but
returned to Poland to join Tadeusz Kościuszko’s insurrection against Russia in 1794. When
the uprising failed, Kołłątaj was imprisoned in Austria (1794–1802). On his release he
resumed his educational activities, founding the college of Krzemieniec in Volhynia, but he
was imprisoned in Moscow in 1807–08. He welcomed the reforms associated with the
introduction of the Napoleonic Code and became the patron of the younger men who
formed the radical opposition in the Duchy of Warsaw.
Kołłątaj’s works include Prawo polityczne narodu polskiego (1790; “Political Rights of the
Polish Nation”), O ustanowieniu i upadku konstytucji polskiej 3-go Maia 1791 (1793; “On
the Promulgation and Fall of the Polish Constitution of May 3, 1791”), and Nil
desperandum (1808).

Hussein ibn Ali
Hussein ibn Ali, also spelled Ḥusayn ibn ʿAlī, in full Ḥusayn ibn ʿAlī al-Hāshimī, (born
c. 1854, Constantinople, Ottoman Empire [now Istanbul, Turkey]—died 1931, Amman,
Transjordan [now Jordan]), emir of Mecca from 1908 to 1916 and king of the Hejaz from
1916 to 1924.
Hussein was born into the line of Hashemites to which the Meccan emirate had passed in
the early 19th century. He became emir in 1908 and, after securing support from Great
Britain in a series of letters known as the Hussein-McMahon correspondence, he led the
Arab Revolt against Ottoman rule during World War I. In October 1916 he proclaimed
himself “king of the Arab countries,” though the Allies formally recognized him only as
king of the Hejaz. Hussein was represented at the Versailles peace conference by his third
son, Faisal, but refused to ratify the Treaty of Versailles (1919) as a protest against the
mandatory regimes imposed on Syria, Palestine, and Iraq by France and Great Britain.
Subsequently he lacked sufficient support from Great Britain to consolidate his control,
while he sowed the seeds of future trouble by deliberately courting the enmity of Ibn Saud.
In March 1924 he proclaimed himself caliph, but war with Ibn Saud was imminent, and the
Ikhwān attack on Al-Ṭāʾif in September found him unprepared. On October 5 he abdicated.
The British conveyed him to Cyprus, where he lived until 1930. He then returned to the
Middle East to live with his son Abdullah in Transjordan, where he died in 1931.
Hussein had four sons: Ali, Abdullah, Faisal, and Zeid. Ali succeeded his father in 1924 as
second king of the Hejaz, but he abdicated the following year. Abdullah became king of
Transjordan (subsequently Jordan), and Faisal became king of Iraq as Faisal I.

Huynh Phu So
Huynh Phu So, Huynh also spelled Huyen, also called Dao Khung, or Phat Song, (born
1919, Hoa Hao, Cochinchina [now in Vietnam]—died 1947, Long Xuyen), Vietnamese
philosopher, Buddhist reformer, and founder (1939) of the religion Phat Giao Hoa Hao,
more simply known as Hoa Hao (q.v.), and an anti-French, anticommunist military and
political activist.
Frail and sickly in his youth, he was educated by a Buddhist monk and at the age of 20 was
apparently miraculously cured. He then set about preaching Buddhist reform, advocating a
return to Theravāda (“Way of the Elders”) Buddhism, from the Mahāyāna (“Greater
Vehicle”) form prevalent in Vietnam, and stressing austerity, Spartan living, simple
worship, and personal salvation. Hoa Hao is an amalgam of Buddhism, ancestor worship,
animistic rites, elements of Confucian doctrine, and indigenous Vietnamese practices. Its
adherents have their own flag, maroon in colour, and their own special holidays.
Huynh Phu So traveled throughout Vietnam practicing herbal healing and acupuncture. In
speaking, he exerted an almost hypnotic influence over his audiences and became known as
Dao Khung (“Mad Monk”). He predicted with accuracy the fall of France in World War II,
the Japanese invasion of Indochina, and the intervention of the United States at a later date.
His success as a prophet led his followers to call him the Phat Song (“Living Buddha”).
As his fame and his adherents increased, his inflammatory speeches brought him to the
attention of the French colonial authorities. Exiled from one Vietnamese province after
another, he continued to draw disciples. Finally he was committed to a mental institution,
where he converted the doctor in charge to his philosophy. In desperation the French tried
to exile him to Laos, but he was kidnapped by Japanese agents in 1942 and held prisoner in
Saigon (now Ho Chi Minh City).
After the war, disagreement, first with the French and then with the communist Viet Minh,
made the Hoa Hao sect an aggressive religio-political-military cult. Huynh Phu So was
abducted while traveling to a meeting ostensibly to reconcile differences between Hoa Hao
and the Viet Minh and was executed after a “trial” in Long Xuyen. Many of the Hoa Hao
faithful refusing to believe that he died, predict his return in a time of crisis.

Huynh Tan Phat
Huynh Tan Phat, (born 1913, near My Tho, Vietnam—died Sept. 30, 1989, Ho Chi Minh
City), one of the leading theoreticians of the National Liberation Front (NLF), the
Vietnamese guerrilla organization formed in 1960 to oppose the U.S.-backed Saigon
government and to reunite the country. From 1969 he was president of the South
Vietnamese Provisional Revolutionary Government, which replaced the Saigon
government in 1975.
While at Hanoi University in the 1930s, Huynh Tan Phat became active in the struggle for
the liberation of Vietnam from French rule. During World War II he opposed the Japanese
occupation. From 1944 to 1945 he edited an anti-French newspaper, Thanh Nien (“Youth”).
After the war he joined the Vanguard Youth organization, a movement for social reform
and political change, and eventually became secretary-general of the liberal Democratic
Party. Despite his high standing in the Democratic Party, which claimed to be opposed to
communism, Phat joined the Viet Minh, the united front guerrilla organization headed by
Ho Chi Minh, as the only group constituting an effective resistance against the French.
During the First Indochina War (1946–54), Phat, although twice imprisoned, was in charge
of the organization’s information service.
After the Viet Minh defeated the French and an international conference at Geneva divided
Vietnam into northern and southern zones, Phat remained in Saigon, working as an
architect while continuing to be active in the Democratic Party. In 1958, when President
Ngo Dinh Diem moved to suppress all opposition parties in South Vietnam, Phat and his
organization were forced to go underground. In 1960 he became chairman of the Saigon-
Cho Lon-Gia Dinh Special Zone Central Committee, which opposed the Diem government;
the same year he joined the newly formed NLF. From 1964 to 1966 he served as secretary-
general of the NLF Central Committee, the most powerful position in the organization, and,
in 1969, when the NLF established its Provisional Revolutionary Government, Phat
became its president. In 1976 he was elected a vice premier in the Council of Ministers of
Vietnam, and in 1982 he also became chairman of the State Commission for Capital
Construction.

Hāshim al-ʿAtāsī
Hāshim al-ʿAtāsī, (born 1875, Homs, Syria—died December 5, 1960, Homs), nationalist
politician and three-time president of Syria.
An official in the Ottoman administration of Syria in his early life, ʿAtāsī became a
member of the Syrian Congress in 1919. The next year the Congress proclaimed Greater
Syria an independent constitutional monarchy. As one of the nationalist leaders opposing
the French occupation and mandate in the 1920s, he was elected president of the
Constituent Assembly, which, because of its adherence to the 1920 proclamation, was
dissolved by the French authorities in May 1930. In 1936 he headed a Syrian delegation to
Paris that negotiated the Franco-Syrian treaty providing for Syrian independence; on his
return he was elected president of the republic. Faced with the French government’s refusal
to ratify the treaty, he resigned in 1939.
In 1949, following a year of military uprisings, ʿAtāsī was called upon to form a
provisional government and to hold elections for a Constituent Assembly. In December

Ian Smith, in full Ian Douglas Smith, (born April 8,
1919, Selukwe, Rhodesia [now Shurugwi, Zimbabwe]
—died Nov. 20, 2007, Cape Town, S.Af.), first native-
born prime minister of the British colony of Southern
Rhodesia (now Zimbabwe) and ardent advocate of
white rule, who in 1965 declared Rhodesia’s
independence and its subsequent withdrawal from the
British Commonwealth.
Smith attended local schools and entered Rhodes University in Grahamstown, S.Af. He
interrupted his studies in 1939 to join the Royal Air Force, and, as a fighter pilot in World
War II, he was shot down twice. After completing his work at the university, Smith was
elected to the Southern Rhodesian Assembly in 1948. He joined the governing Federal
Party when the Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland was formed in 1953. By 1958 Smith
had become chief government whip in Parliament, but when the Federalists supported a
new constitution allowing greater representation for black Africans in Parliament, Smith
founded the Rhodesian Front (1961) and attracted white-supremacist support. Promising
independence from Britain with a government based upon the white minority, his party
won a surprise victory in the election of 1962.
When in April 1964 Smith became prime minister of Southern Rhodesia (the Federation
had been dissolved in 1963), his first official act was to authorize the arrest and banishment
of four black African nationalists. The disorders that followed were suppressed with police
action. When the Commonwealth prime ministers’ conference met in July 1964, Smith
refused to discuss a new constitution that would lead to eventual black-majority rule.
Further negotiations with Britain proved futile, and on Nov. 11, 1965, Smith unilaterally
declared Rhodesia’s independence (referred to as the Unilateral Declaration of
Independence, or UDI). Great Britain refused to accept Rhodesian independence, and, at
Britain’s request, economic sanctions against Rhodesia were applied by the UN Security
Council. Smith then severed all ties with the Commonwealth. A referendum was held in
Rhodesia on June 20, 1969, regarding the adoption of a constitution that would enshrine
political power in the hands of the white minority and establish Rhodesia as a republic;
Rhodesia’s predominantly white electorate overwhelmingly approved both measures. The

constitution was passed by Parliament in November, and on March 2, 1970, Rhodesia
declared itself a republic.
In the early 1970s, black Rhodesian guerrilla activity against the government escalated, led
by the Patriotic Front, a coalition of the forces of black nationalists Robert Mugabe and
Joshua Nkomo. From 1972 they conducted their activities from bases in Mozambique, and
Smith countered with vigorous retaliatory measures with the Rhodesian armed forces. The
economy suffered steadily because of the percentage of government funds invested in
military support, and the steady increase in guerrilla action was accompanied by a flow of
white emigration from Rhodesia.
Smith was compelled finally in 1977 to negotiate with the moderate black leader Bishop
Muzorewa. A transfer of power in the government to the blacks was initiated in 1978, and
Smith was a member of the Transitional Executive Council that oversaw the process. He
remained prime minister until May 1979 and then served as minister without portfolio in
the black majority government of Zimbabwe-Rhodesia from May to December 1979.
Smith continued to serve in Parliament until 1987.
In 1992 Smith led the United Front, a coalition of his party (now known as the
Conservative Alliance of Zimbabwe) and black parties opposed to Mugabe’s policies. His
involvement in the coalition was short-lived, however, and by the end of the decade he had
largely retired from active national politics. His autobiography, The Great Betrayal: The
Memoirs of Ian Douglas Smith, was published in 1997.

Ibrahim Datuk Tan Malaka
Ibrahim Datuk Tan Malaka, (Headman) (born 1894—died April 16, 1949, Blitar, Java),
Indonesian Communist leader who competed with Sukarno for control of the Indonesian
nationalist movement.
Tan Malaka was a Minangkabau (a people of Sumatra) and a schoolteacher. When he
returned in 1919 from Europe, where he was educated, he began to espouse Communist
doctrines. The Communists had been working with the leading nationalist group, the
Sarekat Islām (Islāmic Association) but in 1921 they split off and moved in the direction of
revolutionary action, still trying to take with them local branches of Sarekat Islām. The
following year Tan Malaka attempted to convert a strike of government pawnshop
employees into a general strike, but the effort failed, and Dutch officials ordered him to
leave the Dutch East Indies.
Tan Malaka represented Indonesia at the Fourth Congress of the Comintern (Communist
International) in 1922, when he was appointed Comintern agent for Southeast Asia and
Australia. He opposed as premature a Communist-backed rebellion in 1926 and was
blamed by its proponents for the uprising’s failure. The next year, however, he organized a
group in Bangkok called the Indonesian Republic Party; its aim was to develop
underground cadres to work in Indonesia. The party gained strength, but with little visible
success in weakening colonial rule.
Tan Malaka returned to Java in 1944, during the Japanese occupation in World War II, and
afterward competed for power against Indonesian president Sukarno. Sukarno, however,
outmanoeuvred Tan Malaka by bringing Sutan Sjahrir to power as prime minister. Tan
Malaka responded by creating a coalition, called the Persatuan Perdjuangan (United
Struggle), to oppose any negotiated settlement with the Dutch, which Sjahrir favoured.
When Sjahrir resigned in February 1946, Tan Malaka was asked to form a Cabinet. The
members of the coalition failed to reach accord, however, and Sjahrir was recalled. Tan
Malaka then either attempted a coup or was caught up in the plans of others and was
arrested on July 6, 1946, and held for two years without trial. On his release he supported a
new political party, the Partai Murba (Proletarian Party). At that time the Dutch and
Indonesians were at war for control of the country, Sukarno and Mohammad Hatta were
prisoners of the Dutch, and much of the Communist leadership had been killed. In
December 1948 Tan Malaka made a bid for control of the Indonesian revolution. From the
city of Kediri, Java, which remained in Indonesian hands, Tan Malaka proclaimed himself

head of Indonesia. When the Dutch attacked Kediri, he escaped but within a few months
was captured and executed by supporters of Sukarno.
Tan Malaka wrote several political works; the best known is the autobiographical Dari
Pendjara ke Pendjara (“From Prison to Prison”). He was a powerful, moving force in the
creation of Indonesia but, after 1966 and the massacre of Communists, his name went into
eclipse.

Ignacy Potocki
Ignacy Potocki, (born February 28, 1750, Podhajce,
Poland—died August 30, 1809, Vienna, Austria),
statesman, political reformer, grand marshal of
Lithuania, count, and a member of one of Poland’s
oldest aristocratic families.
Potocki played a prominent part from 1773 in the
Polish Commission of National Education; from 1781 to 1784 he was the grand master of
Polish Freemasonry. As a leader of the patriotic faction, he engineered a national alliance
with Prussia (1790), pressed for broad administrative reforms, and, with his fellow
reformer Hugo Kołłątaj, wrote the major provisions of the centralizing constitution of May
3, 1791.
After the invasion of Poland by Russian troops (May 1792) and the installation of a
Russian client regime (July 1792)—the Confederation of Targowica—Potocki fled to
Dresden, where he planned a national uprising with Kołłątaj and the military leader
Tadeusz Kościuszko. Returning to Poland in 1794, he conducted foreign affairs for the
insurrectionary government, but he was unable to win external support for the Polish cause.
After the fall of Warsaw to the Russians in November 1794, he was sent as a state prisoner
to St. Petersburg. On his release in 1796 he returned to Poland. He died while on a
diplomatic assignment to present a petition to Napoleon for the incorporation of Galicia in
the Grand Duchy of Warsaw.

drove the French from the Ionian Islands and organized them into the Septinsular Republic.

became its secretary of state (1803). France regained control of the islands (1807),
however, and Kapodístrias entered the Russian foreign service (1809). He became an
expert on Balkan affairs, which earned him a post with the commander of Russia’s armed
forces on the lower Danube River (1812). After the army marched north to oppose
Napoleon’s invasion of Russia (1812), Kapodístrias was assigned as a diplomat to the army
staff (1813) and later was sent by Alexander I on a special mission to Switzerland (1814).
After attending the postwar Congress of Vienna as one of Russia’s representatives (1814–
15), Kapodístrias became a highly influential adviser of the emperor; and, after January
1816, he was given equal responsibility with Karl Robert Nesselrode, the director of the
Ministry of Foreign Affairs, for the conduct of Russia’s foreign policy.
Kapodístrias, however, expressed doubts about Alexander’s Holy Alliance with Austria and
Prussia and objected to Russia’s approval of Austria’s suppression of the revolts in Naples
and Piedmont (1820–21). Consequently, he earned the political enmity of Austria’s
chancellor Metternich, who used his increasing influence over Alexander to undermine
Kapodístrias’ position. When Alexander refused to support the Greek revolt against Turkey
(begun March 1821), Kapodístrias, who had a deep sympathy for the cause of Greek
independence, although he had earlier refused to lead the major Greek revolutionary
organization, found himself in an intolerable position. In 1822, therefore, he took an
extended leave of absence from the Russian service and settled in Geneva, where he
devoted himself to supplying material and moral relief to the Greek rebels until April 1827,
when he was elected provisional president of Greece.

Resigning from the Russian service, he then toured Europe seeking financial and
diplomatic support for the War of Greek Independence and arrived at Návplion (Nauplia),
Greece’s capital, in January 1828. He subsequently directed his energies toward negotiating
with Great Britain, France, and Russia (which had all joined the war against the Turks)
over the settlement of Greece’s frontiers and the selection of its new monarch. He became
leader of a party with pro-Russian sympathies. He also worked to organize an effective
government apparatus and to subordinate powerful, semiautonomous local leaders to the
authority of the new state. In the process, however, he acquired many enemies, two of
whom, Konstantinos and Georgios Mavromikhalis of Maina, assassinated Kapodístrias as
he entered a church.

Isaac Sears
Isaac Sears, (born July 1?, 1730, West Brewster, Massachusetts [U.S.]—died October 28,
1786, Guangzhou, China), patriot leader in New York City before the American
Revolution, who earned the nickname “King Sears” by virtue of his prominent role in
inciting and commanding anti-British demonstrations.
A merchant whose shipping activities included privateering, Sears first exhibited his patriot
leanings when the Stamp Act crisis erupted in 1765. He became a mob leader during the
anti-British riots in New York City, and he belonged to the newly formed patriot
organization the Sons of Liberty.
Sears led the boycott of British goods during colonial protests of the Townshend Acts.
Repeal of the Townshend Acts produced a period of calm in the colonies from 1770 to
1773, but imposition of the Tea Act in 1773 gave new life to the Sons of Liberty. In 1774
Sears led a New York version of the Boston Tea Party, and he signed the call for a meeting
of representatives from the colonies.
Sears was arrested in April 1775 for his activities, but his admirers rescued him at the
jailhouse door. Later that month—after the bloodshed at Lexington and Concord—he and
his followers drove the loyalist officials out of New York City and seized control of the
municipal government. His subsequent attacks on loyalist businessmen elicited official
disapproval from patriot committees, but they earned Sears the backing of the New York
citizenry.
The capture of New York City by the British compelled Sears to move to Boston from 1777
to 1783, during which time Sears spent time at sea as a privateer. In 1784 and again in 1786
he was elected to the New York state legislature. He was in China on a trading venture
when he died there in 1786.

Ismāʿīl al-Azharī
Ismāʿīl al-Azharī, (born October 30, 1900, Omdurman, Sudan—died August 26, 1969,
Khartoum), Sudanese statesman, who was instrumental in achieving his country’s
independence and served as prime minister in 1954–56.
Educated at Gordon Memorial College at Khartoum and at the American University of
Beirut, al-Azharī became president of the Graduates’ General Congress in 1940. At first the
Congress was concerned primarily with educational and social reforms, but it later opposed
British administration of the Sudan and instead supported the Sudan’s union with Egypt. In
1943, following a split within the Congress, al-Azharī organized the Ashiggāʾ (“Brothers”)
party; his opposition to the British proposal for self-government in the Sudan brought about
his arrest in December 1948.
In 1952 he was made president of the National Unionist Party (NUP), which won an
overwhelming victory in the elections of 1953. Al-Azharī became the first Sudanese prime
minister in January 1954. It became clear to him that union with Egypt could be achieved
only at the risk of a civil war, given the anti-union opposition in the Sudan. In May 1955 he
therefore pledged to work for complete independence. Shortly after Sudan gained
independence (January 1, 1956), however, his power collapsed from factional rivalries
within the NUP. In 1958 a military government took power. In 1964 al-Azharī reemerged
as the head of the NUP and in 1965 was appointed president of the Supreme Council (i.e.,
head of state). He was overthrown in a military coup on May 25, 1969.

Itzhak Ben-Zvi
Itzhak Ben-Zvi, original name Isaac Shimshelevich,
(born Nov. 24, 1884, Poltava, Ukraine—died April
23, 1963, Jerusalem [Israel]), second president of
Israel (1952–63) and an early Zionist leader in
Palestine, who helped create the political, economic,
and military institutions basic to the formation of the
state of Israel.
A Zionist from his youth, Ben-Zvi in 1905 helped form the Russian Poale Zion, a
socialistically oriented Zionist group that set an important ideological precedent for later
institutions in Palestine and elsewhere and led to the formation of the Poale Zion World
Federation in 1907. He settled in Palestine and in 1908 helped found ha-Shomer, a self-
defense organization for Jewish agricultural settlements. In 1909 he founded in Jerusalem
the first Hebrew high school in Palestine.
Exiled from Palestine in 1915 by the Turks, Ben-Zvi traveled to the United States, where
with David Ben-Gurion, later prime minister of Israel, he founded Heḥalutz, a Zionist
pioneer youth organization, and the Jewish Legion to fight alongside the British against the
Germans and Turks in Palestine during World War I. He returned with the legion to
Palestine in 1918 and two years later helped create the Histadrut, the General Federation of
Labour, which became the dominant labour organization in Israel. He served as a member
of Histadrut’s secretariat from 1920 to 1929, when he and Ben-Gurion founded the Mapai
Party, which became the leading political force in the country. One of the creators of Vaʿad
Leʿumi, the Jewish National Council representing 90 percent of the Jewish community
during the British mandate in Palestine (1920–48), Ben-Zvi served as the council’s
chairman from 1931 to 1944 and as its president from 1944 to 1949.
Ben-Zvi signed Israel’s Declaration of Independence on May 14, 1948, and was elected to
the Knesset the following year. He became president of Israel in 1952, a position he held
until his death. Also a noted scholar of Middle Eastern history and archaeology, he founded
the Institute for Research of Jewish Middle Eastern Communities (now the Ben-Zvi
Institute) in 1948 and directed it until 1960. He wrote a history of the Jews, The Exiled and
the Redeemed (1958).

repudiated the old subservience to the Mongol-derived Tatars. He also laid the
administrative foundations of a centralized Russian state.
Early life and reign
Ivan was born at the height of the civil war that raged between supporters of his father,
Grand Prince Vasily II of Muscovy, and those of his rebellious uncles. His early life was
dramatic and tumultuous: when his father was arrested and blinded by his cousin in 1446,
Ivan was first hidden in a monastery and then smuggled to safety, only to be treacherously
handed over to his father’s captors later in the year; shortly after his father’s release in the
same year Ivan was solemnly affianced—for purely political reasons—to the daughter of
the Grand Prince of Tver, whom he married in 1452. During the last years of his father’s
reign, he gained experience in the arts of war and government. At the age of 12 he was
placed nominally in command of a military expedition dispatched to deal with the remnants
of his father’s internal enemies in the far north; and at 18 he led a successful campaign
against the Tatars in the south. Vasily II died on March 27, 1462, and was succeeded by
Ivan as grand prince of Moscow.
Little is known of Ivan’s activities during the early part of his reign. Apart from a series of
sporadic and largely successful campaigns against his eastern neighbours, the Tatars of
Kazan, there was evidently not much beyond the routine business of ruling to occupy him.
But his private life soon changed radically. In 1467 his childhood bride died (perhaps
poisoned), leaving him with only one son. In view of the primitive state of Muscovite
medicine and the demonstrable reluctance of Ivan’s brothers to see the royal line continued
longer than was necessary, the likelihood of the son predeceasing his father and thus
robbing him of an heir appeared only too real, and another wife had to be sought.
Curiously, the initiative seems to have come from outside; in 1469 Cardinal Bessarion
wrote from Rome offering Ivan the hand of his ward and pupil, Zoë Palaeologus, niece of

the last emperor of Byzantium. It took three years before Zoë, who, on entering Moscow,
changed her name to Sofia (and perhaps her faith to Orthodoxy), was married to Ivan in the
Kremlin.
Middle reign
At Ivan’s accession many Great Russian lands were
not yet under Muscovite control; Ukraine and the
upper Oka districts were part of the Polish–
Lithuanian union and Ivan himself, in name at least,
was a tributary of the Khan of the Golden Horde. He
set himself the task of reconquering from Poland–
Lithuania the Ukrainian possessions of his
forefathers. But first the independent Great Russian lands had to be annexed or subdued
and subservience to the Tatars had to be repudiated.
After rendering the Kazan Horde on his eastern flank temporarily impotent by a series of
campaigns (1467–69), Ivan attempted to subdue Novgorod and its huge northern empire.
He repeatedly invaded Novgorod, formally forced it to accept his sovereignty (1478),
stripped it of the last vestiges of political freedom, secularized large tracts of its church
lands, annexed its colonies, and replaced many of its citizens with reliable elements from
his own domains. By 1489 Novgorod could offer no more resistance to Ivan. Of the
remaining Russian lands still technically independent in 1462, Yaroslavl and Rostov were
annexed by treaty (1463 and 1474, respectively). Tver offered little resistance and meekly
yielded to Moscow in 1485. Ryazan and Pskov alone retained their independence at the
cost of abject subservience to their virtual suzerain.
Freedom from subjection to Khan Ahmed of the Golden Horde came in 1480. To
counterbalance Ahmed’s friendship with Poland–Lithuania, Ivan concluded an invaluable
alliance with Khan Mengli Girei of Crimea. After a victorious campaign by Ivan in 1480,
Ahmed withdrew his forces from Ivan’s dominions, and although Ahmed’s sons continued
to worry Moscow and Crimea until their final defeat in 1502, Ivan from 1480 no longer
considered himself a vassal of the Khan and entered the field of European diplomacy as an
independent sovereign. By tact and diplomacy he managed to maintain his friendship with
Mengli and to avoid serious trouble in Kazan for the rest of his reign.
In 1480 Ivan also had to cope with the danger of rebellion by his two brothers Andrey and
Boris, who had been incensed by his high-handed appropriation of their deceased elder

brother’s estates. They defected with their armies to the western frontiers but eventually
returned and acknowledged Ivan’s territorial acquisitions and primacy.
Late reign
In 1490 Ivan’s eldest son by his first wife died of gout. He had been ineptly treated by a
Jewish doctor who had been brought to Russia by Sofia’s brother, and Ivan suspected foul
play. He now had to solve the problem of who was to be his heir—his eldest son’s son
Dmitry (born 1483) or his eldest son by Sofia, Vasily (born 1479). For seven years he
vacillated. Then, in 1497, he nominated Dmitry as heir. Sofia, anxious to see her son
assured of the throne, planned rebellion against her husband, but the plot was uncovered.
Ivan disgraced Sofia and Vasily and had Dmitry crowned grand prince (1498).
However, in 1500 Vasily rebelled again and defected to the Lithuanians. Ivan was forced to
compromise. At that stage of his war with Lithuania he could not risk the total alienation of
his son and wife. And so, in 1502, he gave the title to Vasily and imprisoned Dmitry and his
mother, Yelena.
At home Ivan’s policy was to centralize the administration by stripping the appanage
princes of land and authority. As for the boyars, they were stripped of much of their
authority and swiftly executed or imprisoned if suspected of treason. Ivan’s reign saw the
beginning of the pomestie system, whereby the servants of the grand prince were granted
estates on a basis of life tenure and on condition of loyal service.
Ivan’s last years were years of disappointment. The war against Lithuania had not ended as
conclusively and satisfactorily as he had expected—much of Ukraine was still in the hands
of a strangely buoyant enemy; his ecclesiastical plans for secularizing church lands had
been thwarted at the Council of 1503, and the Khanate of Kazan, which had been so
carefully neutralized during Ivan’s reign, was beginning to rid itself of Muscovite tutelage.
Ivan died in the autumn of 1505.
Legacy
In terms of political success, the 15th-century grand prince Ivan III was easily the greatest
of all the descendants of Rurik, the reputed founder of Russia. No ruler of Muscovy until
Peter I the Great, two centuries later, did more to consolidate and develop the achievements
of his predecessors, to strengthen the authority of the monarch, or to lay the foundations for
a centralized state. By means of cunning diplomacy and shrewdly calculated aggression,
Ivan not only established Muscovy as a great power to be reckoned with by the rulers and

diplomats of Europe but also set in motion the reconquest of Ukraine from Poland and
Lithuania.
In spite of his great achievements, Ivan died unmourned and seemingly unloved. Singularly
little is known about him as a man. He was tall and thin and had a slight stoop. It is said
that women fainted in his presence, so frightened were they by his awesome gaze. His only
known pleasures were those of the bed and the table. His contemporaries are silent about
his virtues. Yet few scholars have underestimated the role of Ivan in the creation of the
Russian state, and none dispute the significance of his diplomatic and military successes. It
may be that the excessive cautiousness of his character, the lack of élan and glamour, and
the very dullness of the man have prevented historians from universally recognizing the
appellation of “the Great,” first attributed to him by the Austrian ambassador to his son’s
court.

J.B.M. Hertzog
J.B.M. Hertzog, in full James Barry Munnik Hertzog, (born April 3, 1866, near
Wellington, Cape Colony [now in South Africa]—died Nov. 21, 1942, Pretoria, S.Af.),
soldier and statesman who held the post of prime minister of the Union of South Africa (see
South Africa) from 1924 to 1939. His political principles, as first stated in his speeches in
1912, were “South Africa First” (even before the British Empire) and the “Two Streams
Policy,” under which each part of the white South African nation—i.e., the British and the
Afrikaner (Dutch)—would be free from domination by the other.
Hertzog was trained in law (Victoria College, Stellenbosch, and Amsterdam University)
and practiced in Pretoria (1892–95) until appointed to the high court of the Orange Free
State. During the South African War (1899–1902) he rose to assistant chief commandant of
the Free State forces and became a resourceful and daring guerrilla leader. Though he
would have preferred to fight on, Hertzog was persuaded to sign the Peace of Vereeniging
(May 1902).
Hertzog then entered politics by organizing the Orangia-Unie (Orangia Union). When self-
government was given to the largely Afrikaner Orange Free State in 1907, he became a
member of the Cabinet and created a national controversy by championing the Dutch
language. In 1910 he was taken into the Union’s first Cabinet under Louis Botha, but his
strong nationalist views caused Botha to form a new government without him in 1912.
Hertzog, meanwhile, formed the National Party (1914), which gained strength by opposing
Botha’s active support of Britain during World War I. He also pursued policies of South
African freedom from British control and dual-medium education in Afrikaans (the
language of Afrikaners, developed from Dutch) and English, and he encouraged
bilingualism among civil servants. In 1924, with the support of the Labour Party, Hertzog
became prime minister.
As prime minister, Hertzog led the government that gave the Union its flag, made
Afrikaans an official language, and protected home industries. In imperial conferences he
helped to pave the way for the Statute of Westminster (1931), by which Britain recognized
the equality of the dominions, including their right to secede. Intrigues within his own party
and the failure of his policy to preserve the gold standard moved Hertzog into a coalition
with Jan Smuts in 1933. The next year the National and South African parties joined to
form the United Party. With the strong support of Afrikaners, Hertzog carried through a
racial policy that resulted in greater segregation of whites and blacks, disenfranchisement

of the Cape Africans, and the expansion of the native reserves. Nevertheless, he was
outflanked by the opposition Purified Nationalist Party led by Daniel F. Malan, who,
opposing the fusion with the South African Party, advocated more stringent measures.
In the 1938 election Hertzog’s party won a great triumph, but the outbreak of World War II
led to his downfall. Though agreed on internal matters, his party was divided on the
question of South Africa’s role in the war. He insisted on neutrality; Smuts and his
followers felt that South Africa’s place was next to Britain. When Hertzog’s motion to
remain out of the war was defeated in Parliament (Sept. 4, 1939) by a vote of 80 to 67, he
resigned, and Smuts formed a new government. Healing the breach between himself and
Malan’s Purified Nationalists, Hertzog became the leader of the opposition. The reunion
survived until Malan’s followers rejected Hertzog’s program of equal rights for British
South Africans and Afrikaners. At the end of 1940 an embittered Hertzog retired from
politics.

Hertzog   J.B.M. Hertzog J.B.M. Hertzog, in full James Barry Munnik Hertzog, (born April 3, 1866, near Wellington, Cape Colony [now in South Africa]—died Nov. 21, 1942, Pretoria, S.Af. ), soldier and statesman who held the post of prime minister of the Union of South Africa (see South Africa) from 1924 to 1939. His political principles, as first stated in his speeches in 1912, were “South Africa First” (even before the British Empire) and the “Two Streams Policy,” under which each part of the white South African nation—i.e., the British and the Afrikaner (Dutch)—would be free from domination by the other. Hertzog was trained in law (Victoria College, Stellenbosch, and Amsterdam University) and practiced in Pretoria (1892–95) until appointed to the high court of the Orange Free State. During the South African War (1899–1902) he rose to assistant chief commandant of the Free State forces and became a resourceful and daring guerrilla leader. Though he would have preferred to fight on, Hertzog was persuaded to sign the Peace of Vereeniging (May 1902). Hertzog then entered politics by organizing the Orangia-Unie (Orangia Union). When self- government was given to the largely Afrikaner Orange Free State in 1907, he became a member of the Cabinet and created a national controversy by championing the Dutch language. In 1910 he was taken into the Union’s first Cabinet under Louis Botha, but his strong nationalist views caused Botha to form a new government without him in 1912. Hertzog, meanwhile, formed the National Party (1914), which gained strength by opposing Botha’s active support of Britain during World War I. He also pursued policies of South African freedom from British control and dual-medium education in Afrikaans (the language of Afrikaners, developed from Dutch) and English, and he encouraged bilingualism among civil servants. In 1924, with the support of the Labour Party, Hertzog became prime minister. As prime minister, Hertzog led the government that gave the Union its flag, made Afrikaans an official language, and protected home industries. In imperial conferences he helped to pave the way for the Statute of Westminster (1931), by which Britain recognized the equality of the dominions, including their right to secede. Intrigues within his own party and the failure of his policy to preserve the gold standard moved Hertzog into a coalition with Jan Smuts in 1933. The next year the National and South African parties joined to form the United Party. With the strong support of Afrikaners, Hertzog carried through a racial policy that resulted in greater segregation of whites and blacks, disenfranchisement  J.B.M. Hertzog   of the Cape Africans, and the expansion of the native reserves. Nevertheless, he was outflanked by the opposition Purified Nationalist Party led by Daniel F. Malan, who, opposing the fusion with the South African Party, advocated more stringent measures. In the 1938 election Hertzog’s party won a great triumph, but the outbreak of World War II led to his downfall. Though agreed on internal matters, his party was divided on the question of South Africa’s role in the war. He insisted on neutrality; Smuts and his followers felt that South Africa’s place was next to Britain. When Hertzog’s motion to remain out of the war was defeated in Parliament (Sept. 4, 1939) by a vote of 80 to 67, he resigned, and Smuts formed a new government. Healing the breach between himself and Malan’s Purified Nationalists, Hertzog became the leader of the opposition. The reunion survived until Malan’s followers rejected Hertzog’s program of equal rights for British South Africans and Afrikaners. At the end of 1940 an embittered Hertzog retired from politics.

Jagjivan Ram
Jagjivan Ram, (born April 5, 1908, Chandwa, near Arrah, India—died July 6, 1986, New
Delhi), Indian politician, government official, and longtime leading spokesman for the
Dalits (formerly untouchables; officially called Scheduled Castes), a low-caste Hindu
social class in India. He served in the Lok Sabha (lower chamber of the Indian parliament)
for more than 40 years.
Ram was born into a Dalit family in what is now Bihar state and was among the first of his
caste to receive a higher education. He attended Banaras Hindu University in Varanasi and
in 1931 earned a bachelor’s degree from the University of Calcutta (now in Kolkata). Also
in 1931 he became a member of the Indian National Congress (Congress Party), then led by
Mohandas K. Gandhi. Ram played a role in the founding (1935) of the All-India Depressed
Classes League, an organization dedicated to attaining equality for Dalits. During the late
1930s he also was elected to a position in the Bihar government and helped organize a rural
labour movement.
Ram was jailed twice in the early 1940s for his political activities associated with the Quit
India movement against British rule. In 1946 he became the youngest minister in
Jawaharlal Nehru’s provisional government and, after independence in 1947, in the
country’s national government. He held the labour portfolio until 1952. Thereafter he
served in Nehru’s cabinet in the posts of minister for communications (1952–56), transport
and railways (1956–62), and transport and communications (1962–63).
Ram supported Indira Gandhi (Nehru’s daughter) in her bid for elected office, and, when in
1966 she succeeded Lal Bahadur Shastri to the office of prime minister, Ram was
appointed minister for labour, employment, and rehabilitation (1966–67). He served as
minister for food and agriculture (1967–70), and in 1970 he was made minister of defense.
During his tenure in that office, India helped to establish the independent state of
Bangladesh. From 1974 to 1977 Ram was minister for agriculture and irrigation. He
initially supported Prime Minister Gandhi’s declaration of a state of emergency in 1975. By
1977, however, he and several other politicians had resigned from the cabinet and formed
the Janata (People’s) Party (JP; a precursor of the Janata Dal), a coalition that successfully
opposed Gandhi and the Congress Party that year in elections to the Lok Sabha.
Disappointed that he was not chosen prime minister, Ram once again accepted the post of
minister of defense (1977–79) in two JP governments. He remained a member of the Lok
Sabha until his death.

James Otis
James Otis, (born Feb. 5, 1725, West Barnstable,
Mass. [U.S.]—died May 23, 1783, Andover, Mass.),
American political activist during the period leading
up to the American Revolution. He helped formulate
the colonists’ grievances against the British
government in the 1760s.
Son of the elder James Otis, who was already prominent in Massachusetts politics, the
younger Otis graduated from Harvard College in 1743 and was admitted to the bar in 1748.
He moved his law practice from Plymouth to Boston in 1750. His reputation was built
mainly upon his famous challenge in 1761 to the British-imposed writs of assistance—
general search warrants designed to enforce more strictly the trade and navigation laws in
North America. These search warrants authorized customhouse officers to search any house
for smuggled goods; neither the house nor the goods had to be specifically mentioned in
the writs. Arguing before the Superior Court in Boston, Otis raised the doctrine of natural
law underlying the rights of citizens and argued that such writs, even if authorized by
Parliament, were null and void. In harking back to fundamental English constitutional law,
Otis offered the colonists a basic doctrine upon which their publicists could draw for
decades to come. At this time he also reportedly coined the oft-quoted phrase “Taxation
without representation is tyranny.”
Otis was elected in May 1761 to the General Court (provincial legislature) of
Massachusetts and was reelected nearly every year thereafter during his active life. In 1766
he was chosen speaker of the house, though this choice was negated by the royal governor
of the province.
In September 1762 Otis published A Vindication of the Conduct of the House of
Representatives of the Province of Massachusetts Bay in defense of that body’s rebuke of
the governor for asking the assembly to pay for ships not authorized by them—though sent
to protect New England fisheries against French privateers. Otis also wrote various state
papers addressed to the colonies to enlist them in the common cause, and he also sent such
papers to the government in England to uphold the rights or set forth the grievances of the
colonists. His influence at home in controlling and directing the movement of events
toward freedom was universally felt and acknowledged, and few Americans were so
frequently quoted, denounced, or applauded in Parliament and the British press before

1769. In 1765 he was a delegate to the Stamp Act Congress in New York City, and there he
was a conspicuous figure, serving on the committee that prepared the address sent to the
House of Commons.
Already prone to fits of insanity, Otis was struck on the head during an altercation with a
crown officer in 1769 and was rendered harmlessly insane, with only occasional lucid
intervals, until his death. He died in 1783 after being struck by lightning.

Janis Čakste
Janis Čakste, (born Sept. 14, 1859, Lielsesava, Courland, Russian Empire [now in Latvia]
—died March 14, 1927, Riga, Latvia), patriot and president (1922–27) of the Republic of
Latvia, who, through political activity in Latvia and Russia and on diplomatic missions to
the West, helped spearhead Latvia’s struggle for independence.
After serving as a lawyer for some years in the Courland public prosecutor’s office, Čakste
left public service in 1888 to practice law in Jelgava and edit a Latvian newspaper, Tevija
(“Fatherland”). He served on a committee appointed by the local administration to inquire
into agricultural conditions in Courland (1902) and was frequently a member of Russian
imperial government committees. He was elected to the first Russian Duma (Assembly) in
1906, and, after the Duma was dissolved by the imperial government, he was one of those
who signed the Viborg protest and consequently lost his political privileges.
When the German invasion of Courland (July 1915) in World War I obliged him to leave
Jelgava, Čakste moved to Petrograd, where he was one of the founders of the Latvian
Refugees Committee, which, in addition to providing relief for war refugees, worked for
Latvian autonomy. In 1916 he went to Stockholm to promote the cause of Latvian
independence and there wrote Die Letten und ihre Latwija (1917; “The Letts and Their
Latvia”). Elected chairman of the Latvian People’s Council in 1918, he was later the head
of the delegation sent to London and to the Paris Peace Conference to secure the
recognition of the Latvian republic. While he was absent on that mission, Čakste was
elected president of the National Council (1918); he was later elected president of the
Latvian constituent assembly (1920) and, when the first Saeima (Parliament) convened,
president of the Republic of Latvia (Nov. 14, 1922). He was reelected in November 1925
and died in office.

Jawaharlal Nehru
Jawaharlal Nehru
Jawaharlal Nehru, byname Pandit (Hindi: “Pundit”
or “Teacher”) Nehru, (born November 14, 1889,
Allahabad, India—died May 27, 1964, New Delhi), first
prime minister of independent India (1947–64), who
established parliamentary government and became
noted for his neutralist (nonaligned) policies in foreign
affairs. He was also one of the principal leaders of
India’s independence movement in the 1930s and ’40s.
Early years
Nehru was born to a family of Kashmiri Brahmans, noted for their administrative aptitude
and scholarship, who had migrated to Delhi early in the 18th century. He was a son of
Motilal Nehru, a renowned lawyer and leader of the Indian independence movement, who
became one of Mohandas (Mahatma) Gandhi’s prominent associates. Jawaharlal was the
eldest of four children, two of whom were girls. A sister, Vijaya Lakshmi Pandit, later
became the first woman president of the United Nations General Assembly.
Until the age of 16, Nehru was educated at home by a series of English governesses and
tutors. Only one of those—a part-Irish, part-Belgian theosophist, Ferdinand Brooks—
appears to have made any impression on him. Jawaharlal also had a venerable Indian tutor
who taught him Hindi and Sanskrit. In 1905 he went to Harrow, a leading English school,
where he stayed for two years. Nehru’s academic career was in no way outstanding. From
Harrow he went to Trinity College, Cambridge, where he spent three years earning an
honours degree in natural science. On leaving Cambridge he qualified as a barrister after
two years at the Inner Temple, London, where in his own words he passed his examinations
“with neither glory nor ignominy.”
The seven years Nehru spent in England left him in a hazy half-world, at home neither in
England nor in India. Some years later he wrote, “I have become a queer mixture of East
and West, out of place everywhere, at home nowhere.” He went back to India to discover
India. The contending pulls and pressures that his experience abroad were to exert on his
personality were never completely resolved.
Four years after his return to India, in March 1916, Nehru married Kamala Kaul, who also
came from a Kashmiri family that had settled in Delhi. Their only child, Indira

Priyadarshini, was born in 1917; she would later (under her married name of Indira
Gandhi) also serve (1966–77 and 1980–84) as prime minister of India. In addition, Indira’s
son Rajiv Gandhi succeeded his mother as prime minister (1984–89).
Political apprenticeship
On his return to India, Nehru at first had tried to settle down as a lawyer. Unlike his father,
however, he had only a desultory interest in his profession and did not relish either the
practice of law or the company of lawyers. For that time he might be described, like many
of his generation, as an instinctive nationalist who yearned for his country’s freedom, but,
like most of his contemporaries, he had not formulated any precise ideas on how it could be
achieved.
Nehru’s autobiography discloses his lively interest in Indian politics during the time he was
studying abroad. His letters to his father over the same period reveal their common interest
in India’s freedom. But not until father and son met Mahatma Gandhi and were persuaded
to follow in his political footsteps did either of them develop any definite ideas on how
freedom was to be attained. The quality in Gandhi that impressed the two Nehrus was his
insistence on action. A wrong, Gandhi argued, should not only be condemned but be
resisted. Earlier, Nehru and his father had been contemptuous of the run of contemporary
Indian politicians, whose nationalism, with a few notable exceptions, consisted of
interminable speeches and long-winded resolutions. Jawaharlal was also attracted by
Gandhi’s insistence on fighting against British rule of India without fear or hate.
Nehru met Gandhi for the first time in 1916 at the annual meeting of the Indian National
Congress (Congress Party) in Lucknow. Gandhi was 20 years his senior. Neither seems to
have made any initially strong impression on the other. Gandhi makes no mention of Nehru
in an autobiography he dictated while imprisoned in the early 1920s. The omission is
understandable, since Nehru’s role in Indian politics was secondary until he was elected
president of the Congress Party in 1929, when he presided over the historic session at
Lahore (now in Pakistan) that proclaimed complete independence as India’s political goal.
Until then the party’s objective had been dominion status.
Nehru’s close association with the Congress Party dates from 1919 in the immediate
aftermath of World War I. That period saw an early wave of nationalist activity and
governmental repression, which culminated in the Massacre of Amritsar in April 1919;
according to an official report, 379 persons were killed (though other estimates were
considerably higher), and at least 1,200 were wounded when the local British military

commander ordered his troops to fire on a crowd of unarmed Indians assembled in an
almost completely enclosed space in the city.
When, late in 1921, the prominent leaders and workers of the Congress Party were
outlawed in some provinces, Nehru went to prison for the first time. Over the next 24 years
he was to serve another eight periods of detention, the last and longest ending in June 1945,
after an imprisonment of almost three years. In all, Nehru spent more than nine years in
jail. Characteristically, he described his terms of incarceration as normal interludes in a life
of abnormal political activity.
His political apprenticeship with the Congress Party lasted from 1919 to 1929. In 1923 he
became general secretary of the party for two years, and he did so again in 1927 for another
two years. His interests and duties took him on journeys over wide areas of India,
particularly in his native United Provinces (now Uttar Pradesh state), where his first
exposure to the overwhelming poverty and degradation of the peasantry had a profound
influence on his basic ideas for solving those vital problems. Though vaguely inclined
toward socialism, Nehru’s radicalism had set in no definite mold. The watershed in his
political and economic thinking was his tour of Europe and the Soviet Union during 1926–
27. Nehru’s real interest in Marxism and his socialist pattern of thought stemmed from that
tour, even though it did not appreciably increase his knowledge of communist theory and
practice. His subsequent sojourns in prison enabled him to study Marxism in more depth.
Interested in its ideas but repelled by some of its methods—such as the regimentation and
the heresy hunts of the communists—he could never bring himself to accept Karl Marx’s
writings as revealed scripture. Yet from then on, the yardstick of his economic thinking
remained Marxist, adjusted, where necessary, to Indian conditions.
Struggle for Indian independence
After the Lahore session of 1929, Nehru emerged as the leader of the country’s intellectuals
and youth. Gandhi had shrewdly elevated him to the presidency of the Congress Party over
the heads of some of his seniors, hoping that Nehru would draw India’s youth—who at that
time were gravitating toward extreme leftist causes—into the mainstream of the Congress
movement. Gandhi also correctly calculated that, with added responsibility, Nehru himself
would be inclined to keep to the middle way.
After his father’s death in 1931, Nehru moved into the inner councils of the Congress Party
and became closer to Gandhi. Although Gandhi did not officially designate Nehru his
political heir until 1942, the Indian populace as early as the mid-1930s saw in Nehru the

natural successor to Gandhi. The Gandhi-Irwin Pact of March 1931, signed between
Gandhi and the British viceroy, Lord Irwin (later Lord Halifax), signalized a truce between
the two principal protagonists in India. It climaxed one of Gandhi’s more-effective civil
disobedience movements, launched the year before as the Salt March, in the course of
which Nehru had been arrested.
Hopes that the Gandhi-Irwin Pact would be the prelude to a more-relaxed period of Indo-
British relations were not borne out; Lord Willingdon (who replaced Irwin as viceroy in
1931) jailed Gandhi in January 1932, shortly after Gandhi’s return from the second Round
Table Conference in London. He was charged with attempting to mount another civil
disobedience movement; Nehru was also arrested and sentenced to two years’
imprisonment.
The three Round Table Conferences in London, held to advance India’s progress to self-
government, eventually resulted in the Government of India Act of 1935, which gave the
Indian provinces a system of popular autonomous government. Ultimately, it provided for a
federal system composed of the autonomous provinces and princely states. Although
federation never came into being, provincial autonomy was implemented. During the mid-
1930s Nehru was much concerned with developments in Europe, which seemed to be
drifting toward another world war. He was in Europe early in 1936, visiting his ailing wife,
shortly before she died in a sanitarium in Lausanne, Switzerland. Even at that time he
emphasized that in the event of war India’s place was alongside the democracies, though he
insisted that India could fight in support of Great Britain and France only as a free country.
When the elections following the introduction of provincial autonomy brought the
Congress Party to power in a majority of the provinces, Nehru was faced with a dilemma.
The Muslim League under Mohammed Ali Jinnah (who was to become the creator of
Pakistan) had fared badly at the polls. Congress, therefore, unwisely rejected Jinnah’s plea
for the formation of coalition Congress–Muslim League governments in some of the
provinces, a decision that Nehru had supported. The subsequent clash between the
Congress and the Muslim League hardened into a conflict between Hindus and Muslims
that was ultimately to lead to the partition of India and the creation of Pakistan.
Imprisonment during World War II
At the outbreak of World War II in September 1939, the viceroy, Lord Linlithgow, had
committed India to war without consulting the autonomous provincial ministries. The
Congress Party’s high command withdrew its provincial ministries as a protest, but

https://www.britannica.com/print/article/408232
5/9
Congress’s action left the political field virtually open to Jinnah and the Muslim League.
Nehru’s views on the war differed from those of Gandhi. Initially, Gandhi believed that
whatever support was given to the British should be given unconditionally and that it
should be of a nonviolent character. Nehru held that nonviolence had no place in defense
against aggression and that India should support Great Britain in a war against Nazism but
only as a free country. If it could not help, it should not hinder.
In October 1940, Gandhi, abandoning his original stand, decided to launch a limited civil
disobedience campaign in which leading advocates of Indian independence were selected
to participate one by one. Nehru, the second of those leaders, was arrested and sentenced to
four years’ imprisonment. After spending a little more than a year in jail, he was released,
along with other Congress prisoners, three days before the bombing of Pearl Harbor in
Hawaii. When the Japanese carried their attack through Burma (now Myanmar) to the
borders of India in the spring of 1942, the British government, faced by that new military
threat, decided to make some overtures to India. Prime Minister Winston Churchill
dispatched Sir Stafford Cripps, a member of the British War Cabinet who was politically
close to Nehru and also knew Jinnah, with proposals for a settlement of the constitutional
problem. Cripps’s mission failed, however, for Gandhi would accept nothing less than
independence.
The initiative in the Congress Party then passed to Gandhi, who called on the British to
leave India; Nehru, though reluctant to embarrass the war effort, had no alternative but to
join Gandhi. Following the Quit India resolution passed by the Congress Party in Bombay
(now Mumbai) on August 8, 1942, the entire Congress working committee, including
Gandhi and Nehru, was arrested and imprisoned. Nehru emerged from that—his ninth and
last detention—only on June 15, 1945.
Within two years after his release, India was to be partitioned and free. A final attempt by
the viceroy, Lord Wavell, to bring the Congress Party and the Muslim League together
failed. The Labour government that had meanwhile displaced Churchill’s wartime
administration dispatched, as one of its first acts, a Cabinet mission to India and later
replaced Lord Wavell with Lord Mountbatten. The question was no longer whether India
was to be independent but whether it was to consist of one or more independent states.
Hindu-Muslim antagonism, culminating in late 1946 in clashes that killed some 7,000
people, made the partition of the subcontinent inevitable. While Gandhi refused to accept
it, Nehru reluctantly but realistically acquiesced. On August 15, 1947, India and Pakistan

Jawaharlal Nehru, Indira Gandhi,
and Harry S. Truman
emerged as two separate independent countries. Nehru became independent India’s first
prime minister.
Achievements as prime minister
In the 35 years from 1929, when Gandhi chose Nehru
as president of the Congress session at Lahore, until
his death, as prime minister, in 1964, Nehru remained
—despite the debacle of the brief conflict with China
in 1962—the idol of his people. His secular approach
to politics contrasted with Gandhi’s religious and
traditionalist attitude, which during Gandhi’s lifetime
had given Indian politics a religious cast—
misleadingly so, for, although Gandhi may have appeared to be a religious conservative, he
was actually a social nonconformist trying to secularize Hinduism. The real difference
between Nehru and Gandhi was not in their attitudes toward religion but in their attitudes
toward civilization. Whereas Nehru talked in an increasingly modern idiom, Gandhi was
harking back to the glories of ancient India.
The importance of Nehru in the perspective of Indian history is that he imported and
imparted modern values and ways of thinking, which he adapted to Indian conditions.
Apart from his stress on secularism and on the basic unity of India, despite its ethnic and
religious diversities, Nehru was deeply concerned with carrying India forward into the
modern age of scientific discovery and technological development. In addition, he aroused
in his people an awareness of the necessity of social concern with the poor and the outcast
and of respect for democratic values. One of the achievements of which he was particularly
proud was the reform of the ancient Hindu civil code that finally enabled Hindu widows to
enjoy equality with men in matters of inheritance and property.
Internationally, Nehru’s star was in the ascendant until October 1956, when India’s attitude
on the Hungarian Revolution against the Soviets brought his policy of nonalignment
(neutralism) under sharp scrutiny by the noncommunist countries. In the United Nations,
India was the only nonaligned country to vote with the Soviet Union on the invasion of
Hungary, and it was thereafter difficult for Nehru to command credence in his calls for
nonalignment. In the early years after independence, anticolonialism had been the
cornerstone of his foreign policy. His interest in the issue waned, however, after Zhou
Enlai, the Chinese prime minister, stole the spotlight from him at the Bandung Conference
of African and Asian countries that was held in Indonesia in 1955. By the time of the first

conference of the Non-Aligned Movement in Belgrade, Yugoslavia (now in Serbia), in
1961, Nehru had substituted nonalignment for anticolonialism as his most-pressing
concern.
The Sino-Indian conflict of 1962, however, exposed
Nehru’s wishful thinking on nonalignment. When
Chinese forces threatened to overrun the Brahmaputra
River valley in the northeast as a result of a long-
standing border dispute regarding Arunachal Pradesh
state, they exposed the hollowness of Nehru’s
proclamation, “Hindu-Chini bhai bhai” (“Indians and
Chinese are brothers”). Nehru’s subsequent call for
Western aid made virtual nonsense of his nonalignment policy. China soon withdrew its
troops.
The Kashmir region—claimed by both India and
Pakistan—remained a perennial problem throughout
Nehru’s term as prime minister. In the months after
the partition of the subcontinent in 1947, he made
tentative efforts to settle the dispute between the two
new countries while Hari Singh, the maharaja of
Kashmir, decided on which country he would join.
When Singh chose India, however, fighting broke out between the two sides. The UN
brokered a cease-fire line in the region, and Nehru proposed territorial adjustments along
the line that failed. That demarcation became the line of control that still separates the
Indian- and Pakistani-administered portions of the region.
Nehru was more fortunate in his efforts to solve the problem of the Portuguese colony of
Goa, the last remaining foreign-controlled entity in India. Although its military occupation
by Indian troops in December 1961 raised a furor in many Western countries, in the
hindsight of history, Nehru’s action is justifiable. With the withdrawal of the British and the
French, the Portuguese colonial presence in India had become an anachronism. Both the
British and the French had withdrawn peacefully. If the Portuguese were not prepared to
follow suit, Nehru had to find ways to dislodge them. After first trying persuasion, in
August 1955 he had permitted a group of unarmed Indians to march into Portuguese
territory in a nonviolent demonstration. Even though the Portuguese opened fire on the
demonstrators, killing nearly 30, Nehru stayed his hand for six years, appealing meanwhile

to Portugal’s Western friends to persuade its government to cede the colony. When India
finally struck, Nehru could claim that neither he nor the government of India had ever been
committed to nonviolence as a policy.
Nehru’s health showed signs of deteriorating not long after the clash with China. He
suffered a slight stroke in 1963, and a more-debilitating attack followed in January 1964.
He died a few months later from a third and fatal stroke.
Legacy
While consciously assertive in his Indianness, Nehru never exuded the Hindu aura and
atmosphere clinging to Gandhi’s personality. Because of his modern political and economic
outlook, he was able to attract the younger intelligentsia of India to Gandhi’s movement of
nonviolent resistance against the British and later to rally them around him after
independence had been gained. Nehru’s Western upbringing and his visits to Europe before
independence had acclimatized him to Western ways of thinking.
Nehru did not conceal his differences with Gandhi on many basic social, economic, and
political issues. He did not share Gandhi’s aversion to industrialization, and he saw to it
that India’s early five-year plans after independence were geared toward heavy
manufacturing. If Nehru accepted Gandhi’s nonviolence, he did so not as a matter of
principle but because he regarded nonviolence as a useful political weapon and the right
policy for India under the prevailing political conditions.
Of all the leaders of the Congress Party—including Gandhi—Nehru alone had given
serious thought to India’s place in the world community. That enabled him not only to
educate the Indian populace on foreign affairs before independence but to project his own
views on Indian foreign policy when freedom came. If Gandhi made Indians aware of
India, Nehru made them also aware of others. When India achieved independence, the
image it presented to the world was really Nehru’s image: in the early years of Indian
nationhood, the world identified India with Nehru.
Throughout his 17 years in the prime minister’s office, he held up democratic socialism as
the guiding star, emphasizing that India needed to achieve both democracy and socialism.
With the help of the overwhelming majority that the Congress Party maintained in the
parliament during his term of office, he advanced toward that goal. The four pillars of his
domestic policies were democracy, socialism, unity, and secularism. He succeeded to a
large extent in maintaining the edifice supported by those four pillars during his lifetime.

He was also one of the principal leaders of India’s independence movement in the 1930s and ’40s. Early years Nehru was born to a family of Kashmiri Brahmans, noted for their administrative aptitude and scholarship, who had migrated to Delhi early in the 18th century. He was a son of Motilal Nehru, a renowned lawyer and leader of the Indian independence movement, who became one of Mohandas (Mahatma) Gandhi’s prominent associates. Jawaharlal was the eldest of four children, two of whom were girls. A sister, Vijaya Lakshmi Pandit, later became the first woman president of the United Nations General Assembly. Until the age of 16, Nehru was educated at home by a series of English governesses and tutors. Only one of those—a part-Irish, part-Belgian theosophist, Ferdinand Brooks— appears to have made any impression on him. Jawaharlal also had a venerable Indian tutor who taught him Hindi and Sanskrit. In 1905 he went to Harrow, a leading English school, where he stayed for two years. Nehru’s academic career was in no way outstanding. From Harrow he went to Trinity College, Cambridge, where he spent three years earning an honours degree in natural science. On leaving Cambridge he qualified as a barrister after two years at the Inner Temple, London, where in his own words he passed his examinations “with neither glory nor ignominy.” The seven years Nehru spent in England left him in a hazy half-world, at home neither in England nor in India. Some years later he wrote, “I have become a queer mixture of East and West, out of place everywhere, at home nowhere.” He went back to India to discover India. The contending pulls and pressures that his experience abroad were to exert on his personality were never completely resolved. Four years after his return to India, in March 1916, Nehru married Kamala Kaul, who also came from a Kashmiri family that had settled in Delhi. Their only child, Indira  Jawaharlal Nehru   Priyadarshini, was born in 1917; she would later (under her married name of Indira Gandhi) also serve (1966–77 and 1980–84) as prime minister of India. In addition, Indira’s son Rajiv Gandhi succeeded his mother as prime minister (1984–89). Political apprenticeship On his return to India, Nehru at first had tried to settle down as a lawyer. Unlike his father, however, he had only a desultory interest in his profession and did not relish either the practice of law or the company of lawyers. For that time he might be described, like many of his generation, as an instinctive nationalist who yearned for his country’s freedom, but, like most of his contemporaries, he had not formulated any precise ideas on how it could be achieved. Nehru’s autobiography discloses his lively interest in Indian politics during the time he was studying abroad. His letters to his father over the same period reveal their common interest in India’s freedom. But not until father and son met Mahatma Gandhi and were persuaded to follow in his political footsteps did either of them develop any definite ideas on how freedom was to be attained. The quality in Gandhi that impressed the two Nehrus was his insistence on action. A wrong, Gandhi argued, should not only be condemned but be resisted. Earlier, Nehru and his father had been contemptuous of the run of contemporary Indian politicians, whose nationalism, with a few notable exceptions, consisted of interminable speeches and long-winded resolutions. Jawaharlal was also attracted by Gandhi’s insistence on fighting against British rule of India without fear or hate. Nehru met Gandhi for the first time in 1916 at the annual meeting of the Indian National Congress (Congress Party) in Lucknow. Gandhi was 20 years his senior. Neither seems to have made any initially strong impression on the other. Gandhi makes no mention of Nehru in an autobiography he dictated while imprisoned in the early 1920s. The omission is understandable, since Nehru’s role in Indian politics was secondary until he was elected president of the Congress Party in 1929, when he presided over the historic session at Lahore (now in Pakistan) that proclaimed complete independence as India’s political goal. Until then the party’s objective had been dominion status. Nehru’s close association with the Congress Party dates from 1919 in the immediate aftermath of World War I. That period saw an early wave of nationalist activity and governmental repression, which culminated in the Massacre of Amritsar in April 1919; according to an official report, 379 persons were killed (though other estimates were considerably higher), and at least 1,200 were wounded when the local British military  Jawaharlal Nehru   commander ordered his troops to fire on a crowd of unarmed Indians assembled in an almost completely enclosed space in the city. When, late in 1921, the prominent leaders and workers of the Congress Party were outlawed in some provinces, Nehru went to prison for the first time. Over the next 24 years he was to serve another eight periods of detention, the last and longest ending in June 1945, after an imprisonment of almost three years. In all, Nehru spent more than nine years in jail. Characteristically, he described his terms of incarceration as normal interludes in a life of abnormal political activity. His political apprenticeship with the Congress Party lasted from 1919 to 1929. In 1923 he became general secretary of the party for two years, and he did so again in 1927 for another two years. His interests and duties took him on journeys over wide areas of India, particularly in his native United Provinces (now Uttar Pradesh state), where his first exposure to the overwhelming poverty and degradation of the peasantry had a profound influence on his basic ideas for solving those vital problems. Though vaguely inclined toward socialism, Nehru’s radicalism had set in no definite mold. The watershed in his political and economic thinking was his tour of Europe and the Soviet Union during 1926– 27. Nehru’s real interest in Marxism and his socialist pattern of thought stemmed from that tour, even though it did not appreciably increase his knowledge of communist theory and practice. His subsequent sojourns in prison enabled him to study Marxism in more depth. Interested in its ideas but repelled by some of its methods—such as the regimentation and the heresy hunts of the communists—he could never bring himself to accept Karl Marx’s writings as revealed scripture. Yet from then on, the yardstick of his economic thinking remained Marxist, adjusted, where necessary, to Indian conditions. Struggle for Indian independence After the Lahore session of 1929, Nehru emerged as the leader of the country’s intellectuals and youth. Gandhi had shrewdly elevated him to the presidency of the Congress Party over the heads of some of his seniors, hoping that Nehru would draw India’s youth—who at that time were gravitating toward extreme leftist causes—into the mainstream of the Congress movement. Gandhi also correctly calculated that, with added responsibility, Nehru himself would be inclined to keep to the middle way. After his father’s death in 1931, Nehru moved into the inner councils of the Congress Party and became closer to Gandhi. Although Gandhi did not officially designate Nehru his political heir until 1942, the Indian populace as early as the mid-1930s saw in Nehru the  Jawaharlal Nehru   natural successor to Gandhi. The Gandhi-Irwin Pact of March 1931, signed between Gandhi and the British viceroy, Lord Irwin (later Lord Halifax), signalized a truce between the two principal protagonists in India. It climaxed one of Gandhi’s more-effective civil disobedience movements, launched the year before as the Salt March, in the course of which Nehru had been arrested. Hopes that the Gandhi-Irwin Pact would be the prelude to a more-relaxed period of Indo- British relations were not borne out; Lord Willingdon (who replaced Irwin as viceroy in 1931) jailed Gandhi in January 1932, shortly after Gandhi’s return from the second Round Table Conference in London. He was charged with attempting to mount another civil disobedience movement; Nehru was also arrested and sentenced to two years’ imprisonment. The three Round Table Conferences in London, held to advance India’s progress to self- government, eventually resulted in the Government of India Act of 1935, which gave the Indian provinces a system of popular autonomous government. Ultimately, it provided for a federal system composed of the autonomous provinces and princely states. Although federation never came into being, provincial autonomy was implemented. During the mid- 1930s Nehru was much concerned with developments in Europe, which seemed to be drifting toward another world war. He was in Europe early in 1936, visiting his ailing wife, shortly before she died in a sanitarium in Lausanne, Switzerland. Even at that time he emphasized that in the event of war India’s place was alongside the democracies, though he insisted that India could fight in support of Great Britain and France only as a free country. When the elections following the introduction of provincial autonomy brought the Congress Party to power in a majority of the provinces, Nehru was faced with a dilemma. The Muslim League under Mohammed Ali Jinnah (who was to become the creator of Pakistan) had fared badly at the polls. Congress, therefore, unwisely rejected Jinnah’s plea for the formation of coalition Congress–Muslim League governments in some of the provinces, a decision that Nehru had supported. The subsequent clash between the Congress and the Muslim League hardened into a conflict between Hindus and Muslims that was ultimately to lead to the partition of India and the creation of Pakistan. Imprisonment during World War II At the outbreak of World War II in September 1939, the viceroy, Lord Linlithgow, had committed India to war without consulting the autonomous provincial ministries. The Congress Party’s high command withdrew its provincial ministries as a protest, but  Jawaharlal Nehru   Congress’s action left the political field virtually open to Jinnah and the Muslim League. Nehru’s views on the war differed from those of Gandhi. Initially, Gandhi believed that whatever support was given to the British should be given unconditionally and that it should be of a nonviolent character. Nehru held that nonviolence had no place in defense against aggression and that India should support Great Britain in a war against Nazism but only as a free country. If it could not help, it should not hinder. In October 1940, Gandhi, abandoning his original stand, decided to launch a limited civil disobedience campaign in which leading advocates of Indian independence were selected to participate one by one. Nehru, the second of those leaders, was arrested and sentenced to four years’ imprisonment. After spending a little more than a year in jail, he was released, along with other Congress prisoners, three days before the bombing of Pearl Harbor in Hawaii. When the Japanese carried their attack through Burma (now Myanmar) to the borders of India in the spring of 1942, the British government, faced by that new military threat, decided to make some overtures to India. Prime Minister Winston Churchill dispatched Sir Stafford Cripps, a member of the British War Cabinet who was politically close to Nehru and also knew Jinnah, with proposals for a settlement of the constitutional problem. Cripps’s mission failed, however, for Gandhi would accept nothing less than independence. The initiative in the Congress Party then passed to Gandhi, who called on the British to leave India; Nehru, though reluctant to embarrass the war effort, had no alternative but to join Gandhi. Following the Quit India resolution passed by the Congress Party in Bombay (now Mumbai) on August 8, 1942, the entire Congress working committee, including Gandhi and Nehru, was arrested and imprisoned. Nehru emerged from that—his ninth and last detention—only on June 15, 1945. Within two years after his release, India was to be partitioned and free. A final attempt by the viceroy, Lord Wavell, to bring the Congress Party and the Muslim League together failed. The Labour government that had meanwhile displaced Churchill’s wartime administration dispatched, as one of its first acts, a Cabinet mission to India and later replaced Lord Wavell with Lord Mountbatten. The question was no longer whether India was to be independent but whether it was to consist of one or more independent states. Hindu-Muslim antagonism, culminating in late 1946 in clashes that killed some 7,000 people, made the partition of the subcontinent inevitable. While Gandhi refused to accept it, Nehru reluctantly but realistically acquiesced. On August 15, 1947, India and Pakistan  Jawaharlal Nehru   Jawaharlal Nehru, Indira Gandhi, and Harry S. Truman emerged as two separate independent countries. Nehru became independent India’s first prime minister. Achievements as prime minister In the 35 years from 1929, when Gandhi chose Nehru as president of the Congress session at Lahore, until his death, as prime minister, in 1964, Nehru remained —despite the debacle of the brief conflict with China in 1962—the idol of his people. His secular approach to politics contrasted with Gandhi’s religious and traditionalist attitude, which during Gandhi’s lifetime had given Indian politics a religious cast— misleadingly so, for, although Gandhi may have appeared to be a religious conservative, he was actually a social nonconformist trying to secularize Hinduism. The real difference between Nehru and Gandhi was not in their attitudes toward religion but in their attitudes toward civilization.

One of the achievements of which he was particularly proud was the reform of the ancient Hindu civil code that finally enabled Hindu widows to enjoy equality with men in matters of inheritance and property. Internationally, Nehru’s star was in the ascendant until October 1956, when India’s attitude on the Hungarian Revolution against the Soviets brought his policy of nonalignment (neutralism) under sharp scrutiny by the noncommunist countries. In the United Nations, India was the only nonaligned country to vote with the Soviet Union on the invasion of Hungary, and it was thereafter difficult for Nehru to command credence in his calls for nonalignment. In the early years after independence, anticolonialism had been the cornerstone of his foreign policy. His interest in the issue waned, however, after Zhou Enlai, the Chinese prime minister, stole the spotlight from him at the Bandung Conference of African and Asian countries that was held in Indonesia in 1955. By the time of the first  Jawaharlal Nehru   Jawaharlal Nehru and Antonio Segni Kashmir region conference of the Non-Aligned Movement in Belgrade, Yugoslavia (now in Serbia), in 1961, Nehru had substituted nonalignment for anticolonialism as his most-pressing concern. The Sino-Indian conflict of 1962, however, exposed Nehru’s wishful thinking on nonalignment. When Chinese forces threatened to overrun the Brahmaputra River valley in the northeast as a result of a long- standing border dispute regarding Arunachal Pradesh state, they exposed the hollowness of Nehru’s proclamation, “Hindu-Chini bhai bhai” (“Indians and Chinese are brothers”). Nehru’s subsequent call for Western aid made virtual nonsense of his nonalignment policy. China soon withdrew its troops. The Kashmir region—claimed by both India and Pakistan—remained a perennial problem throughout Nehru’s term as prime minister. In the months after the partition of the subcontinent in 1947, he made tentative efforts to settle the dispute between the two new countries while Hari Singh, the maharaja of Kashmir, decided on which country he would join. When Singh chose India, however, fighting broke out between the two sides. The UN brokered a cease-fire line in the region, and Nehru proposed territorial adjustments along the line that failed. That demarcation became the line of control that still separates the Indian- and Pakistani-administered portions of the region. Nehru was more fortunate in his efforts to solve the problem of the Portuguese colony of Goa, the last remaining foreign-controlled entity in India. Although its military occupation by Indian troops in December 1961 raised a furor in many Western countries, in the hindsight of history, Nehru’s action is justifiable. With the withdrawal of the British and the French, the Portuguese colonial presence in India had become an anachronism. Both the British and the French had withdrawn peacefully. If the Portuguese were not prepared to follow suit, Nehru had to find ways to dislodge them. After first trying persuasion, in August 1955 he had permitted a group of unarmed Indians to march into Portuguese territory in a nonviolent demonstration. Even though the Portuguese opened fire on the demonstrators, killing nearly 30, Nehru stayed his hand for six years, appealing meanwhile  Jawaharlal Nehru   to Portugal’s Western friends to persuade its government to cede the colony. When India finally struck, Nehru could claim that neither he nor the government of India had ever been committed to nonviolence as a policy. Nehru’s health showed signs of deteriorating not long after the clash with China. He suffered a slight stroke in 1963, and a more-debilitating attack followed in January 1964. He died a few months later from a third and fatal stroke. Legacy While consciously assertive in his Indianness, Nehru never exuded the Hindu aura and atmosphere clinging to Gandhi’s personality. Because of his modern political and economic outlook, he was able to attract the younger intelligentsia of India to Gandhi’s movement of nonviolent resistance against the British and later to rally them around him after independence had been gained. Nehru’s Western upbringing and his visits to Europe before independence had acclimatized him to Western ways of thinking. Nehru did not conceal his differences with Gandhi on many basic social, economic, and political issues. He did not share Gandhi’s aversion to industrialization, and he saw to it that India’s early five-year plans after independence were geared toward heavy manufacturing. If Nehru accepted Gandhi’s nonviolence, he did so not as a matter of principle but because he regarded nonviolence as a useful political weapon and the right policy for India under the prevailing political conditions. Of all the leaders of the Congress Party—including Gandhi—Nehru alone had given serious thought to India’s place in the world community. That enabled him not only to educate the Indian populace on foreign affairs before independence but to project his own views on Indian foreign policy when freedom came. If Gandhi made Indians aware of India, Nehru made them also aware of others. When India achieved independence, the image it presented to the world was really Nehru’s image: in the early years of Indian nationhood, the world identified India with Nehru. Throughout his 17 years in the prime minister’s office, he held up democratic socialism as the guiding star, emphasizing that India needed to achieve both democracy and socialism. With the help of the overwhelming majority that the Congress Party maintained in the parliament during his term of office, he advanced toward that goal. The four pillars of his domestic policies were democracy, socialism, unity, and secularism. He succeeded to a large extent in maintaining the edifice supported by those four pillars during his lifetime. Jawaharlal Nehru   Frank R. Moraes The Editors of Encyclopaedia Britannica",

Jayaprakash Narayan
Jayaprakash Narayan, also spelled Jai Prakash Narain, also called Jaya Prakash
Narayan, (born October 11, 1902, Sitab Diyara, India—died October 8, 1979, Patna),
Indian political leader and theorist.
Narayan was educated at universities in the United States, where he became a Marxist.
Upon his return to India in 1929, he joined the Indian National Congress (Congress Party).
In 1932 he was sentenced to a year’s imprisonment for his participation in the civil
disobedience movement against British rule in India. Upon release he took a leading part in
the formation of the Congress Socialist Party, a left-wing group within the Congress Party,
the organization that led the campaign for Indian independence. He was imprisoned by the
British again in 1939 for his opposition to Indian participation in World War II on the side
of Britain, but he subsequently made a dramatic escape and for a short time tried to
organize violent resistance to the government before his recapture in 1943. After his release
in 1946 he tried to persuade the Congress leaders to adopt a more militant policy against
British rule.
In 1948 he, together with most of the Congress Socialists, left the Congress Party and in
1952 formed the Praja Socialist Party. Soon becoming dissatisfied with party politics, he
announced in 1954 that he would thenceforth devote his life exclusively to the Bhoodan
Yajna Movement, founded by Vinoba Bhave, which demanded that land be distributed
among the landless. His continuing interest in political problems, however, was revealed
when in 1959 he argued for a “reconstruction of Indian polity” by means of a four-tier
hierarchy of village, district, state, and union councils.
In 1974 Narayan suddenly burst on the Indian political scene as a severe critic of what he
saw as the corrupt and increasingly undemocratic government of Prime Minister Indira
Gandhi. Although he gained a following from students and opposition politicians, there was
less enthusiasm from the masses. The next year a lower court convicted Gandhi of corrupt
election practices, and Narayan called for her resignation. Instead, she declared a national
emergency and jailed Narayan and other opposition leaders. In prison his health broke
down. He was released after five months but never regained his health. When Gandhi and
her party were defeated in elections in 1977, Narayan advised the victorious Janata party in
its choice of leaders to head the new administration.

Jaʿfar al-ʿAskarī
Jaʿfar al-ʿAskarī, also called Jaʿfar Pasha, in full Jaʿfar Pasha Ibn Muṣṭafā Ibn ʿabd
Ar-raḥman Al-ʿaskarī, (born 1887, Baghdad, Iraq, Ottoman Empire [now in Iraq]—died
Oct. 30, 1936, Baghdad), army officer and Iraqi political leader who played an important
role in the Arab nationalist movements during and after World War I.
ʿAskarī was educated in Baghdad and in Istanbul and commissioned in the Ottoman
Turkish army in 1909. He was sent in 1915 to join Turkish forces in Cyrenaica during
World War I, but he was wounded and taken to Cairo as a prisoner by the British. When he
learned of Ottoman attempts to repress Arab nationalists in Syria, he decided to join
Ḥusayn ibn ʿAlī, the emir of Mecca, who, with British aid, had declared a revolt against
Ottoman authority in that city. By 1916 ʿAskarī had assumed the burden of organizing
Ḥusayn’s newly formed Arab army, and he subsequently commanded it in operations
against the Turks in the Hejaz and Syria. After the war he served in the administration of an
Arab state in Syria headed by Ḥusayn’s son, Fayṣal. French military intervention caused
the state’s collapse, but Fayṣal, with British support, became king (as Fayṣal I) of a newly
founded Iraqi national government in 1921.
As independent Iraq’s first minister of defense, ʿAskarī is considered the “father of the
Iraqi army.” Thereafter he served twice as Iraqi prime minister, among other posts, and was
generally a pillar of the new Iraqi monarchy. In 1936 Bakr Ṣidqī overthrew the Iraqi
government and ordered ʿAskarī’s execution.

popular leader, folk hero of the canton of the Vaud,
who led the Vaudois separatist movement against the
rule of Bern (1723).
Annexed by Bern in 1536, the Vaud had long chafed
under the administration of Bernese bailiffs when in 1723 Davel became the focus of
discontent. Claiming divine inspiration and envisioning a Christian revival, he led a
contingent of followers upon Lausanne, the administrative capital of the Vaud (March 31,
1723), where he urged the declaration of Vaudois independence. The city’s councillors
refused compliance with his demands and delivered him to the Bernese authorities.
The movement was crushed and Davel was executed. But his heroic manner on the
execution block won him the admiration of many, and he became a continuing symbol of
the Vaudois struggle for independence, occupying a significant place in local tradition well
into the 20th century.

Jean-Jacques Dessalines
Jean-Jacques Dessalines, (born c. 1758, West Africa—died October 17, 1806, Pont
Rouge, near Port-au-Prince, Haiti), emperor of Haiti who proclaimed his country’s
independence in 1804.
Dessalines was brought to the French West Indian colony of Saint-Domingue (Haiti) as a
slave. He worked as a field hand for a black master until 1791, when he joined the slave
rebellion that broke out in the colony amid the turmoil caused by the French Revolution. In
the decade that followed, he distinguished himself as a lieutenant of the black leader
Toussaint Louverture, who established himself as governor-general of Saint-Domingue
with nominal allegiance to Revolutionary France. When Toussaint was deposed in 1802 by
a French expedition sent by Napoleon Bonaparte to reconquer the colony, Dessalines at
first submitted to the new regime. In 1803, however, when Napoleon declared his intention
to reintroduce slavery (which had been abolished by the French National Convention in
1794), Dessalines and other black and mulatto (of mixed European and African descent)
leaders rose in rebellion. They expelled the French from Saint-Domingue, and on January
1, 1804, Dessalines, as governor-general, proclaimed the entire island of Hispaniola an
independent country under the Arawak-derived name Haiti. The following September he
adopted the title of emperor as Jacques I.
Dessalines continued many of Toussaint’s policies, including the use of forced labour on
plantations to prevent reversion to a purely subsistence economy. In a series of actions
meant to prevent any renewal of white dominance over the blacks, who formed more than
80 percent of the population, he confiscated land owned by white people, made it illegal for
them to own property, and, perhaps fearing them as potential subversives in the event of
another French invasion, launched a campaign of extermination against the country’s white
inhabitants in which thousands were killed. Resistance to Dessalines and his autocratic rule
grew among the mulatto elites. He was finally killed trying to put down a revolt under the
mulatto leader Alexandre Sabès Pétion, after which Pétion and the black leader Henry
Christophe divided Haiti between themselves.

Joaquim José da Silva Xavier
Joaquim José da Silva Xavier, byname Tiradentes (Portuguese: “Tooth-puller”), (born
1748, near São João del Rei, Minas Gerais, Brazil—died April 21, 1792, Rio de Janeiro),
Brazilian patriot and revolutionary who organized and led the first major outbreak against
Portuguese rule in Brazil. Unsuccessful, he was tried and executed. The nobleness of Silva
Xavier’s defense has made him a Brazilian national hero, and he is viewed as one of the
precursors of independence in Latin America.
Educated by his priest brother, Silva Xavier early became a voracious reader. Working as a
physician, a merchant, a soldier, and a dentist (hence his nickname Tiradentes), he read
widely in the French Philosophes and carried with him copies of the constitutions of the 13
original states of the United States. Sharing his ideas with other intellectuals in the
captaincy of Minas Gerais, he advocated complete independence from Portugal. An attempt
by Portuguese officials to collect back taxes touched off the call for the rebellion, called the
Inconfidência Mineira, led by Tiradentes.
The uprising was a disaster, and Tiradentes was captured in Rio de Janeiro in April 1789. In
a trial that lasted two years, he defended the republican cause with great dignity and force.

Johan van Oldenbarnevelt
Johan van Oldenbarnevelt, (born Sept. 14, 1547,
Amersfoort, Spanish Netherlands [now in the
Netherlands]—died May 13, 1619, The Hague,
Neth.), lawyer, statesman, and, after William I the
Silent, the second founding father of an independent
Netherlands. He mobilized Dutch forces under
William’s son Maurice and devised the anti-Spanish
triple alliance with France and England (1596). In the Twelve Years’ Truce (1609) he
reaffirmed Holland’s dominant role in the Dutch republic.
Early career
Oldenbarnevelt studied law at Leuven (Louvain), Bourges, and Heidelberg (where his
ultimate conversion to Protestantism first germinated) and, probably, Padua. After his
return to the Netherlands he settled down as an advocaat (“counsel”) at the Hof van
Holland, which was effectively the court of appeal for the province of that name,
established at The Hague.
When, in 1572, two of the Netherlands provinces, Holland and Zeeland, succeeded in
shaking off the Spanish rule from Brussels, Oldenbarnevelt did not follow the Court of
Appeal, which fled to Utrecht, but decided to throw in his lot with the movement of
national liberation. He even took part in an attempt to relieve the besieged towns of
Haarlem and Leiden. In 1576 he was appointed pensionary (chief executive) of Rotterdam,
an office that automatically implied membership of the provincial states (assembly), and,
when the national revolt had spread to the other provinces, frequent attendance at the
States-General in Brussels or Antwerp. In 1578, when a total reconquest by the Spanish
armies under the leadership of Alessandro Farnese, duke of Parma, threatened,
Oldenbarnevelt was one of the negotiators of the Union of Utrecht (concluded January
1579), which was to serve as a kind of makeshift constitution for the United Provinces until
1795. During the negotiations, it became apparent that Oldenbarnevelt was aiming at
securing for Holland the politically unassailable position to which the strategically all-but-
unassailable province considered itself entitled after having borne the brunt of the revolt
alone with Zeeland for nearly seven years. These activities also brought him into fairly
close contact with William the Silent.

Political leadership
In 1586, two years after William’s assassination, Oldenbarnevelt accepted the appointment
by the States of Holland as the province’s landsadvocaat (chief minister); in this office he
became the real trustee of William the Silent’s political inheritance. While the latter’s son,
Maurice of Nassau, a brilliant military commander, was in charge of the actual warfare in
the field, it was Oldenbarnevelt who, at first in close collaboration with him, mobilized and
coordinated the country’s available energy and resources, thus making warfare possible. As
one of these activities, he took an active part in the founding of the Dutch East India
Company.
Although theoretically a servant of only one out of seven sovereign provinces,
Oldenbarnevelt, who himself undertook several diplomatic missions to France and
England, was virtually the union’s foreign secretary. In this capacity, too, it was he who
continued the work of William the Silent and succeeded in integrating the somewhat
suspicious, politically unorthodox new commonwealth of rebels. In this respect, his
greatest triumph was the conclusion of a full-fledged triple alliance with France and
England in 1596.
Oldenbarnevelt’s main achievement in the field of foreign policy was, however, the so-
called Twelve Years’ Truce, concluded in 1609 after long-protracted negotiations, by which
the original national program of ousting the Spaniards from the whole of the Netherlands
was virtually abandoned and the northern commonwealth of the seven provinces
established as such.
On the other hand, it was also in this achievement that the all-pervading flaw in
Oldenbarnevelt’s position as the union’s leading statesman became apparent—namely, the
very circumstance that he was pledged by oath to only one out of those seven provinces,
the province of Holland. Filling a vacuum created by the fact that the formerly predominant
provinces, Brabant and Flanders, had been reconquered by Spanish arms, Holland, a
hitherto peripheral county, had become preeminent; it contributed close to 59 percent of the
federal budget. Oldenbarnevelt was Holland’s chief exponent and advocate within the
union setup.
In the same way, the princes of Orange found themselves almost automatically cast in the
role of prime exponents of the union conception, and it is in the light of this that the
ensuing conflict between Oldenbarnevelt and Maurice becomes fundamentally
understandable, even without a detailed examination of its multiple origins. According to
1/16/23, 2:23 PM

the same logic, Maurice had been made stadtholder of Holland by Oldenbarnevelt and his
political friends, with the express purpose of safeguarding the province’s individuality and
special position in the days (1586) when Robert Dudley, earl of Leicester, as governor-
general, was trying to impose his conception of centralized government on the various
provinces.
Religious conflicts
During the Twelve Years’ Truce, the latent conflict crystallized around its religious facets.
The astonishing success of the Netherlands’ independence movement was indissolubly
connected with the fact that, sooner or later, all the provinces “remaining with the union”
came to be ruled by Calvinist minorities for whom, short of renouncing their faith, there
existed no possibility of reconciliation with the abjured ruler, Philip II of Spain. As for
Oldenbarnevelt, like William the Silent, he too had accepted membership of the Reformed
Church, but he and his fellow “regents” in Holland cherished the ideal of a church that was,
though based on the Reformation in its Calvinist shape, sufficiently latitudinarian in its
dogma to attract and satisfy all those who were willing to relinquish the Roman obedience.
According to these rulers of Holland, the nation had rebelled against the centralizing and
tyrannical tendencies of its Hispanicized overlord for the sake of freedom, including
freedom from religious inquisition, whether Roman Catholic, Spanish, or Calvinist. As
seen by many theologians and preachers, on the other hand, the revolt had taken place for
the sake of the Reformed religion in its most uncompromisingly strict dogmatic variety.
When, on the perilous issue of predestination, the antithesis became polarized in a conflict
between two professors of theology at Leiden—the strict Gomarus and the more moderate
Arminius—Oldenbarnevelt and the majority of the voting towns in Holland, though not
Amsterdam, favoured the Arminians against the bulk of the Calvinized masses, who were
staunchly Gomarist or, as they were commonly called, Counter-Remonstrant.
Paradoxically, Oldenbarnevelt and his adherents even had to safeguard the principle of
tolerance by somewhat intolerant measures; those preachers who, in spite of various
decrees to the purpose, remained stubbornly unwilling to refrain from preaching
controversial sermons were dismissed and sometimes exiled.
The religious controversy was, moreover, inextricably interwoven with the antithesis of
province versus union, the Counter-Remonstrant preachers consistently referring to their
religion as the God-given “cement” that kept the union together. Translated into terms of
actual politics, this meant that they wanted to convoke a “national”—i.e., an interprovincial
—synod, trusting (as it turned out, wrongly) that it would establish a church triumphant on
the Genevan model, completely independent from all civil authorities whose worthiness

and consequently whose right to govern would be judged by the churchmen. For obvious
reasons, the States of Holland, led by Oldenbarnevelt, considered a synod of this kind far
too risky and withheld their consent to its meeting.
Disputes with Prince Maurice
Seen in retrospect, the climax announced itself when in July 1617 Prince Maurice sided
openly and defiantly with the Counter-Remonstrants. This veiled declaration of war on
Oldenbarnevelt and the Holland regents’ party was answered by the so-called Sharp
Resolution voted by the States of Holland on Aug. 4, 1617, which, among other things,
encouraged the various towns in the province to recruit armed units of their own, not
integrated in the federal army and not even subject to Maurice’s command as the province’s
captain general. The states remained within their rights in taking such measures. It is
understandable that a man like Maurice considered such actions an intolerable violation of
the union statute. Slow-moving tactician that he was, the prince spent no less than a whole
year in reinforcing his position throughout the union, until suddenly, on Aug. 29, 1618, he
took Oldenbarnevelt prisoner, together with some of his closest collaborators, chief among
whom was his informal “crown prince,” Hugo Grotius, then pensionary of Rotterdam.
Never in the course of Dutch history was the problem of union versus province more
crudely manifest than when it materialized in the vexing question of how and by whom
Oldenbarnevelt was to be tried for his life. His own thesis, unassailable at least in theory,
was that, having exclusively acted as a civil servant of the sovereign province of Holland,
he was responsible only to the judiciary of the province of Holland; his enemies, on the
other hand, wanted to have him tried for felony against the union. As, however, no federal
judiciary existed, the only possible expedient was to summon an extraordinary tribunal ad
hoc; it consisted of 24 judges, by no means all of whom were qualified lawyers, and not a
few of whom, besides being political opponents, were also personally antagonistic to
Oldenbarnevelt. Even so, after more than half a year’s imprisonment and interrogation, he
was condemned to death not for high treason, for which public opinion had been carefully
propagandized, but for the “subversion” of the country’s religion and policy. In May 1619
he was beheaded at the Binnenhof, in The Hague. More than any other event in the
country’s history, his execution has continued to haunt Dutch historiography and even
Dutch politics.

Oldenbarnevelt’s main achievement in the field of foreign policy was, however, the so- called Twelve Years’ Truce, concluded in 1609 after long-protracted negotiations, by which the original national program of ousting the Spaniards from the whole of the Netherlands was virtually abandoned and the northern commonwealth of the seven provinces established as such. On the other hand, it was also in this achievement that the all-pervading flaw in Oldenbarnevelt’s position as the union’s leading statesman became apparent—namely, the very circumstance that he was pledged by oath to only one out of those seven provinces, the province of Holland. Filling a vacuum created by the fact that the formerly predominant provinces, Brabant and Flanders, had been reconquered by Spanish arms, Holland, a hitherto peripheral county, had become preeminent; it contributed close to 59 percent of the federal budget. Oldenbarnevelt was Holland’s chief exponent and advocate within the union setup. In the same way, the princes of Orange found themselves almost automatically cast in the role of prime exponents of the union conception, and it is in the light of this that the ensuing conflict between Oldenbarnevelt and Maurice becomes fundamentally understandable, even without a detailed examination of its multiple origins. According to  Johan van Oldenbarnevelt   the same logic, Maurice had been made stadtholder of Holland by Oldenbarnevelt and his political friends, with the express purpose of safeguarding the province’s individuality and special position in the days (1586) when Robert Dudley, earl of Leicester, as governor- general, was trying to impose his conception of centralized government on the various provinces. Religious conflicts During the Twelve Years’ Truce, the latent conflict crystallized around its religious facets. The astonishing success of the Netherlands’ independence movement was indissolubly connected with the fact that, sooner or later, all the provinces “remaining with the union” came to be ruled by Calvinist minorities for whom, short of renouncing their faith, there existed no possibility of reconciliation with the abjured ruler, Philip II of Spain. As for Oldenbarnevelt, like William the Silent, he too had accepted membership of the Reformed Church, but he and his fellow “regents” in Holland cherished the ideal of a church that was, though based on the Reformation in its Calvinist shape, sufficiently latitudinarian in its dogma to attract and satisfy all those who were willing to relinquish the Roman obedience. According to these rulers of Holland, the nation had rebelled against the centralizing and tyrannical tendencies of its Hispanicized overlord for the sake of freedom, including freedom from religious inquisition, whether Roman Catholic, Spanish, or Calvinist. As seen by many theologians and preachers, on the other hand, the revolt had taken place for the sake of the Reformed religion in its most uncompromisingly strict dogmatic variety. When, on the perilous issue of predestination, the antithesis became polarized in a conflict between two professors of theology at Leiden—the strict Gomarus and the more moderate Arminius—Oldenbarnevelt and the majority of the voting towns in Holland, though not Amsterdam, favoured the Arminians against the bulk of the Calvinized masses, who were staunchly Gomarist or, as they were commonly called, Counter-Remonstrant. Paradoxically, Oldenbarnevelt and his adherents even had to safeguard the principle of tolerance by somewhat intolerant measures; those preachers who, in spite of various decrees to the purpose, remained stubbornly unwilling to refrain from preaching controversial sermons were dismissed and sometimes exiled. The religious controversy was, moreover, inextricably interwoven with the antithesis of province versus union, the Counter-Remonstrant preachers consistently referring to their religion as the God-given “cement” that kept the union together. Translated into terms of actual politics, this meant that they wanted to convoke a “national”—i.e., an interprovincial —synod, trusting (as it turned out, wrongly) that it would establish a church triumphant on the Genevan model, completely independent from all civil authorities whose worthiness  Johan van Oldenbarnevelt   and consequently whose right to govern would be judged by the churchmen. For obvious reasons, the States of Holland, led by Oldenbarnevelt, considered a synod of this kind far too risky and withheld their consent to its meeting. Disputes with Prince Maurice Seen in retrospect, the climax announced itself when in July 1617 Prince Maurice sided openly and defiantly with the Counter-Remonstrants. This veiled declaration of war on Oldenbarnevelt and the Holland regents’ party was answered by the so-called Sharp Resolution voted by the States of Holland on Aug. 4, 1617, which, among other things, encouraged the various towns in the province to recruit armed units of their own, not integrated in the federal army and not even subject to Maurice’s command as the province’s captain general. The states remained within their rights in taking such measures. It is understandable that a man like Maurice considered such actions an intolerable violation of the union statute. Slow-moving tactician that he was, the prince spent no less than a whole year in reinforcing his position throughout the union, until suddenly, on Aug. 29, 1618, he took Oldenbarnevelt prisoner, together with some of his closest collaborators, chief among whom was his informal “crown prince,” Hugo Grotius, then pensionary of Rotterdam. Never in the course of Dutch history was the problem of union versus province more crudely manifest than when it materialized in the vexing question of how and by whom Oldenbarnevelt was to be tried for his life. His own thesis, unassailable at least in theory, was that, having exclusively acted as a civil servant of the sovereign province of Holland, he was responsible only to the judiciary of the province of Holland; his enemies, on the other hand, wanted to have him tried for felony against the union. As, however, no federal judiciary existed, the only possible expedient was to summon an extraordinary tribunal ad hoc; it consisted of 24 judges, by no means all of whom were qualified lawyers, and not a few of whom, besides being political opponents, were also personally antagonistic to Oldenbarnevelt. Even so, after more than half a year’s imprisonment and interrogation, he was condemned to death not for high treason, for which public opinion had been carefully propagandized, but for the “subversion” of the country’s religion and policy. In May 1619 he was beheaded at the Binnenhof, in The Hague. More than any other event in the country’s history, his execution has continued to haunt Dutch historiography and even Dutch politics.

John Adams
Adams, John: birthplace
John Adams
John Adams, (born October 30 [October 19, Old
Style], 1735, Braintree [now in Quincy],
Massachusetts [U.S.]—died July 4, 1826, Quincy,
Massachusetts, U.S.), an early advocate of American
independence from Great Britain, a major figure in
the Continental Congress (1774–77), the author of the
Massachusetts constitution (1780), a signer of the
Treaty of Paris (1783), the first American ambassador
to the Court of St. James (1785–88), and the first vice
president (1789–97) and second president (1797–
1801) of the United States. Although Adams was
regarded by his contemporaries as one of the most
significant statesmen of the revolutionary era, his reputation faded in the 19th century, only
to ascend again during the last half of the 20th century. The modern edition of his
correspondence prompted a rediscovery of his bracing honesty and pungent way with
words, his importance as a political thinker, his realistic perspective on American foreign
policy, and his patriarchal role as founder of one of the most prominent families in
American history.
Early life
Adams was the eldest of the three sons of Deacon
John Adams and Susanna Boylston of Braintree,
Massachusetts. His father was only a farmer and
shoemaker, but the Adams family could trace its
lineage back to the first generation of Puritan settlers
in New England. A local selectman and a leader in the
community, Deacon Adams encouraged his eldest son
to aspire toward a career in the ministry. In keeping with that goal, Adams graduated from
Harvard College in 1755. For the next three years, he taught grammar school in Worcester,
Massachusetts, while contemplating his future. He eventually chose law rather than the
ministry and in 1758 moved back to Braintree, then soon began practicing law in nearby
Boston.

Boston Massacre: trial of British
soldiers
In 1764 Adams married Abigail Smith, a minister’s daughter from neighbouring
Weymouth. Intelligent, well-read, vivacious, and just as fiercely independent as her new
husband, Abigail Adams became a confidante and political partner who helped to stabilize
and sustain the ever-irascible and highly volatile Adams throughout his long career. The
letters between them afford an extended glimpse into their deepest thoughts and emotions
and provide modern readers with the most revealing record of personal intimacy between
husband and wife in the revolutionary era (see Abigail’s letter to John: Doubts About
Independence). Typical of their epistolary exchange was Abigail’s lament regarding John’s
prolonged absence in her letter to him of November 27, 1775:
Colonel Warren returned last week to Plymouth, so that I shall not hear anything from you until
he goes back again, which will not be till the last of this month. He damped my spirits greatly by
telling me that the court had prolonged your stay another month. I was pleasing myself with the
thought that you would soon be upon your return. It is in vain to repine. I hope the public will
reap what I sacrifice.
Their first child, Abigail Amelia, was born in 1765. Their first son, John Quincy, arrived
two years later. Two other sons, Thomas Boylston and Charles, followed shortly thereafter.
(Another child, Susanna, did not survive infancy.)
By then Adams’s legal career was on the rise, and he
had become a visible member of the resistance
movement that questioned Parliament’s right to tax
the American colonies. In 1765 Adams wrote “A
Dissertation on the Canon and Feudal Law,” which
justified opposition to the recently enacted Stamp Act
—an effort to raise revenue by requiring all
publications and legal documents to bear a stamp—by
arguing that Parliament’s intrusions into colonial affairs exposed the inherently coercive
and corrupt character of English politics. Intensely combative, full of private doubts about
his own capacities but never about his cause, Adams became a leading figure in the
opposition to the Townshend Acts (1767), which imposed duties on imported commodities
(i.e., glass, lead, paper, paint, and tea). Despite his hostility toward the British government,
in 1770 Adams agreed to defend the British soldiers who had fired on a Boston crowd in
what became known as the Boston Massacre. His insistence on upholding the legal rights
of the soldiers, who in fact had been provoked, made him temporarily unpopular but also
marked him as one of the most principled radicals in the burgeoning movement for

Continental Congress
Declaration of Independence
American independence. He had a penchant for doing the right thing, most especially when
it made him unpopular.
Continental Congress
In the summer of 1774, Adams was elected to the
Massachusetts delegation that joined the
representatives from 12 of 13 colonies in Philadelphia
at the First Continental Congress. He and his cousin,
Samuel Adams, quickly became the leaders of the
radical faction, which rejected the prospects for
reconciliation with Britain. His “Novanglus” essays,
published early in 1775, moved the constitutional argument forward another notch,
insisting that Parliament lacked the authority not just to tax the colonies but also to legislate
for them in any way. (Less than a year earlier, Thomas Jefferson had made a similar
argument against parliamentary authority in A Summary View of the Rights of British
America.)
By the time the Second Continental Congress
convened in 1775, Adams had gained the reputation
as “the Atlas of independence.” Over the course of the
following year, he made several major contributions
to the patriot cause destined to ensure his place in
American history. First, he nominated George
Washington to serve as commander of the fledging
Continental Army. Second, he selected Jefferson to draft the Declaration of Independence.
(Both decisions were designed to ensure Virginia’s support for the revolution.) Third, he
dominated the debate in the Congress on July 2–4, 1776, defending Jefferson’s draft of the
declaration and demanding unanimous support for a decisive break with Great Britain.
Moreover, he had written Thoughts on Government, which circulated throughout the
colonies as the major guidebook for the drafting of new state constitutions (see primary
source document: The Foundation of Government). In it, among other concerns, he
contemplated the sort of representative assembly that would be most conducive to good
government:
It should be in miniature an exact portrait of the people at large. It should think, feel, reason, and
act like them. That it may be the interest of this assembly to do strict justice at all times, it
should be an equal representation, or, in other words, equal interests among the people should

have equal interests in it. Great care should be taken to effect this, and to prevent unfair, partial,
and corrupt elections.
Adams remained the central figure of the Continental Congress for the following two years.
He drafted the Plan of Treaties in July 1776, a document that provided the framework for a
treaty with France and that almost inadvertently identified the strategic priorities that would
shape American foreign policy over the next century. He was the unanimous choice to head
the Board of War and Ordnance and was thereby made in effect a one-man war department
responsible for raising and equipping the American army and creating from scratch an
American navy. As the prospects for a crucial wartime alliance with France improved late
in 1777, he was chosen to join Benjamin Franklin in Paris to conduct the negotiations. In
February 1778 he sailed for Europe, accompanied by 10-year-old John Quincy.
Foreign service
By the time Adams arrived in Paris, the treaty creating an alliance with France had already
been concluded. He quickly returned home in the summer of 1779, just in time to join the
Massachusetts Constitutional Convention. The other delegates, acknowledging his
constitutional expertise, simply handed him the job of drafting what became the
Massachusetts constitution (1780), which immediately became the model for the other state
constitutions and—in its insistence on a bicameral legislature and the separation of powers
—a major influence on the Constitution of the United States.
The Congress then ordered Adams to rejoin Franklin in Paris to lead the American
delegation responsible for negotiating an end to the war with Britain. This time he took
along his youngest son, Charles, as well as John Quincy, leaving Abigail to tend the farm
and the other two children in Braintree. Not until 1784, almost five years later, was the
entire family reunited in Paris. By then Adams had shown himself an unnatural diplomat,
exhibiting a level of candour and a confrontational style toward both English and French
negotiators that alienated Franklin, who came to regard his colleague as slightly deranged.
Adams, for his part, thought Franklin excessively impressed with his own stature as the
Gallic version of the American genius and therefore inadequately attuned to the important
differences between American and French interests in the peace negotiations. The
favourable terms achieved in the Peace of Paris (1783) can be attributed to the effective
blend of Franklin’s discretion and Adams’s bulldog temperament. Adams’s reputation for
emotional explosions also dates from this period. Recent scholarly studies suggest that he
might have suffered from a hyperthyroid condition subsequently known as Graves’ disease.

In 1784 Jefferson arrived in Paris to replace Franklin as the American minister at the
French court. Over the next few months, Jefferson became an unofficial member of the
Adams family, and the bond of friendship between Adams and Jefferson was sealed, a
lifelong partnership and rivalry that made the combative New Englander and the elegant
Virginian the odd couple of the American Revolution. Jefferson also visited the Adams
family in England in 1785, after Adams had assumed his new post as American ambassador
in London. The two men also joined forces, though Adams as the senior figure assumed the
lead, in negotiating a $400,000 loan from Dutch bankers that allowed the American
government to consolidate its European debts.
Political philosophy
Because he was the official embodiment of American independence from the British
Empire, Adams was largely ignored and relegated to the periphery of the court during his
nearly three years in London. Still brimming with energy, he spent his time studying the
history of European politics for patterns and lessons that might assist the fledgling
American government in its efforts to achieve what no major European nation had
managed to produce—namely, a stable republican form of government.
The result was a massive and motley three-volume collection of quotations,
unacknowledged citations, and personal observations entitled A Defence of the
Constitutions of Government of the United States of America (1787). A fourth volume,
Discourses on Davila (1790), was published soon after he returned to the United States.
Taken together, these lengthy tomes contained Adams’s distinctive insights as a political
thinker. The lack of organization, combined with the sprawling style of the Defence,
however, made its core message difficult to follow or fathom. When read in the context of
his voluminous correspondence on political issues, along with the extensive marginalia he
recorded in the several thousand books in his personal library, that message became clearer
with time.
Adams wished to warn his fellow Americans against all revolutionary manifestos that
envisioned a fundamental break with the past and a fundamental transformation in human
nature or society that supposedly produced a new age. All such utopian expectations were
illusions, he believed, driven by what he called “ideology,” the belief that imagined ideals,
so real and seductive in theory, were capable of being implemented in the world. The same
kind of conflict between different classes that had bedeviled medieval Europe would, albeit
in muted forms, also afflict the United States, because the seeds of such competition were
planted in human nature itself. Adams blended the psychological insights of New England

Adams, John
Puritanism, with its emphasis on the emotional forces throbbing inside all creatures, and
the Enlightenment belief that government must contain and control those forces, to
construct a political system capable of balancing the ambitions of individuals and
competing social classes.
His insistence that elites were unavoidable realities in all societies, however, made him
vulnerable to the charge of endorsing aristocratic rule in America, when in fact he was
attempting to suggest that the inevitable American elite must be controlled, its ambitions
channeled toward public purposes. He also was accused of endorsing monarchical
principles because he argued that the chief executive in the American government, like the
king in medieval European society, must possess sufficient power to check the ravenous
appetites of the propertied classes. Although misunderstood by many of his
contemporaries, the realistic perspective Adams proposed—and the skepticism toward
utopian schemes he insisted upon—has achieved considerable support in the wake of the
failed 20th-century attempts at social transformation in the communist bloc. In Adams’s
own day, his political analysis enjoyed the satisfaction of correctly predicting that the
French Revolution would lead to the Reign of Terror and eventual despotism by a military
dictator.
Vice presidency and presidency
Soon after his return to the United States, Adams
found himself on the ballot in the presidential election
of 1789. Washington was the unanimous selection of
all electors, while Adams finished second, signaling
that his standing as a leading member of the
revolutionary generation was superseded only by that
of Washington himself. Under the electoral rules
established in the recent ratified Constitution, Adams was duly elected America’s first vice
president.
This meant that Adams was the first American statesman to experience the paradox of
being a heartbeat away from maximum power while languishing in the political version of
a cul-de-sac. Adams himself described the vice presidency as “the most insignificant office
that ever the Invention of man contrived or his Imagination conceived.” His main duty was
to serve as president of the Senate, casting a vote only to break a tie. During his eight years
in office, Adams cast between 31 and 38 such votes, more than any subsequent vice
president in American history. He steadfastly supported all the major initiatives of the

Washington administration, including the financial plan of Alexander Hamilton, the
Neutrality Proclamation (1793), which effectively ended the Franco-American Alliance of
1778, the forceful suppression of an insurrection in western Pennsylvania called the
Whiskey Rebellion (1794), and the Jay Treaty (1795), a highly controversial effort to avoid
war with England by accepting British hegemony on the high seas. When Washington
announced his decision not to seek a third term in 1796, Adams was the logical choice to
succeed him.
In the first contested presidential election in American history, Adams won a narrow
electoral majority (71–68) over Jefferson, who thereby became vice president (see primary
source document: Inaugural Address). Adams made an initial effort to bring Jefferson into
the cabinet and involve him in shaping foreign policy, but Jefferson declined the offer,
preferring to retain his independence. This burdened the Adams presidency with a vice
president who was the acknowledged head of the rival political party, the Republicans
(subsequently the Democratic-Republicans). Additional burdens included: inheritance of
Washington’s cabinet, whom Adams unwisely decided to retain, and whose highest loyalty
was to Washington’s memory as embodied in Hamilton; a raging naval conflict with the
French in the Caribbean dubbed the “quasi-war”; and the impossible task of succeeding—
no one could replace—the greatest hero of the revolutionary era.
Despite Washington’s plea for a bipartisan foreign policy in his farewell address (1796), the
“quasi-war” produced a bitter political argument between Federalists, who preferred war
with France to alienating Britain, and Democratic-Republicans, who viewed France as
America’s only European ally and the French Revolution as a continuation of the American
Revolution on European soil. Adams attempted to steer a middle course between these
partisan camps, which left him vulnerable to political attacks from both sides. In 1797 he
sent a peace delegation to Paris to negotiate an end to hostilities, but when the French
directory demanded bribes before any negotiations could begin, Adams ordered the
delegates home and began a naval buildup in preparation for outright war. The Federalist-
dominated Congress called for raising a 30,000-man army, which Adams agreed to
reluctantly. If Adams had requested a declaration of war in 1798, he would have enjoyed
widespread popularity and virtually certain reelection two years later. Instead, he acted with
characteristic independence by sending yet another, and this time successful, peace
delegation to France against the advice of his cabinet and his Federalist supporters. The
move ruined him politically but avoided a costly war that the infant American republic was
ill-prepared to fight. It was a vintage Adams performance, reminiscent of his defense of
British soldiers after the Boston Massacre, which was also principled and unpopular.

John Adams
If ending the “quasi-war” with France was Adams’s major foreign policy triumph, his chief
domestic failure was passage of the Alien and Sedition Acts (1798), which permitted the
government to deport foreign-born residents and indict newspaper editors or writers who
published ""false, scandalous, and malicious writing or writings against the government of
the United States."" A total of 14 indictments were brought against the Republican press
under the sedition act, but the crudely partisan prosecutions quickly became infamous
persecutions that backfired on the Federalists. Although Adams had signed the Alien and
Sedition Acts under pressure from the Federalists in Congress, he shouldered most of the
blame both at the time and in the history books. He came to regard the sedition act as the
biggest political blunder of his life.
The election of 1800 again pitted Adams against Jefferson. Adams ran ahead of the
Federalist candidates for Congress, who were swept from office in a Republican landslide.
However, thanks to the deft maneuvering of Aaron Burr, all 12 of New York’s electoral
votes went to Jefferson, giving the tandem of Jefferson and Burr the electoral victory (73–
65). Jefferson was eventually elected president by the House of Representatives, which
chose him over Burr on the 36th ballot. In his last weeks in office, Adams made several
Federalist appointments to the judiciary, including John Marshall as chief justice of the
United States. These “midnight judges” offended Jefferson, who resented the encroachment
on his own presidential prerogatives. Adams, the first president to reside in the presidential
mansion (later called the White House) in Washington, D.C., was also the first—and one of
the very few—presidents not to attend the inauguration of his successor. On March 4, 1801,
he was already on the road back to Quincy.
Retirement
At age 65 Adams did not anticipate a long retirement.
The fates proved more generous than he expected,
providing him with another quarter century to brood
about his career and life, add to the extensive
marginalia in his books, settle old scores in his
memoirs, watch with pride when John Quincy
assumed the presidency, and add to his already vast
and voluminous correspondence. In an extensive exchange of letters with Benjamin Rush,
the Philadelphia physician and patriotic gadfly, Adams revealed his preoccupation with
fame and developed his own theory of the role ambition plays in motivating man to public
service. Along the way he placed on the record his own candid and often critical portraits
of the other vanguard members of the revolutionary generation.

Adams, John: letter to Thomas
Jefferson
Peacefield
In 1812, thanks in part to prodding from Rush, he
overcame his bitterness toward Jefferson and initiated
a correspondence with his former friend and rival that
totaled 158 letters. Generally regarded as the most
intellectually impressive correspondence between
American statesmen in all of American history, the
dialogue between Adams and Jefferson touched on a
host of timely and timeless subjects: the role of
religion in history, the aging process, the emergence of an American language, the French
Revolution, and the party battles of the 1790s. Adams put it most poignantly to Jefferson:
“You and I ought not to die, before We have explained ourselves to each other.”
More than the elegiac tone of the letters, the
correspondence dramatized the contradictory
impulses generated by the American Revolution and
symbolized by the two aging patriarchs. Adams was
the realist, the skeptic, the principled pessimist.
Jefferson was the idealist, the romantic, the pragmatic
optimist. As if according to a script written by
Providence, the “Sage of Quincy” and the “Sage of Monticello” died within hours of each
other on July 4, 1826, the 50th anniversary to the day of the Declaration of Independence.

Although Adams was regarded by his contemporaries as one of the most significant statesmen of the revolutionary era, his reputation faded in the 19th century, only to ascend again during the last half of the 20th century. The modern edition of his correspondence prompted a rediscovery of his bracing honesty and pungent way with words, his importance as a political thinker, his realistic perspective on American foreign policy, and his patriarchal role as founder of one of the most prominent families in American history. Early life Adams was the eldest of the three sons of Deacon John Adams and Susanna Boylston of Braintree, Massachusetts. His father was only a farmer and shoemaker, but the Adams family could trace its lineage back to the first generation of Puritan settlers in New England. A local selectman and a leader in the community, Deacon Adams encouraged his eldest son to aspire toward a career in the ministry. In keeping with that goal, Adams graduated from Harvard College in 1755. For the next three years, he taught grammar school in Worcester, Massachusetts, while contemplating his future. He eventually chose law rather than the ministry and in 1758 moved back to Braintree, then soon began practicing law in nearby Boston. John Adams   Boston Massacre: trial of British soldiers In 1764 Adams married Abigail Smith, a minister’s daughter from neighbouring Weymouth. Intelligent, well-read, vivacious, and just as fiercely independent as her new husband, Abigail Adams became a confidante and political partner who helped to stabilize and sustain the ever-irascible and highly volatile Adams throughout his long career. The letters between them afford an extended glimpse into their deepest thoughts and emotions and provide modern readers with the most revealing record of personal intimacy between husband and wife in the revolutionary era (see Abigail’s letter to John: Doubts About Independence). Typical of their epistolary exchange was Abigail’s lament regarding John’s prolonged absence in her letter to him of November 27, 1775: Colonel Warren returned last week to Plymouth, so that I shall not hear anything from you until he goes back again, which will not be till the last of this month. He damped my spirits greatly by telling me that the court had prolonged your stay another month. I was pleasing myself with the thought that you would soon be upon your return. It is in vain to repine. I hope the public will reap what I sacrifice. Their first child, Abigail Amelia, was born in 1765. Their first son, John Quincy, arrived two years later. Two other sons, Thomas Boylston and Charles, followed shortly thereafter. (Another child, Susanna, did not survive infancy.) By then Adams’s legal career was on the rise, and he had become a visible member of the resistance movement that questioned Parliament’s right to tax the American colonies. In 1765 Adams wrote “A Dissertation on the Canon and Feudal Law,” which justified opposition to the recently enacted Stamp Act —an effort to raise revenue by requiring all publications and legal documents to bear a stamp—by arguing that Parliament’s intrusions into colonial affairs exposed the inherently coercive and corrupt character of English politics. Intensely combative, full of private doubts about his own capacities but never about his cause, Adams became a leading figure in the opposition to the Townshend Acts (1767), which imposed duties on imported commodities (i.e., glass, lead, paper, paint, and tea). Despite his hostility toward the British government, in 1770 Adams agreed to defend the British soldiers who had fired on a Boston crowd in what became known as the Boston Massacre. His insistence on upholding the legal rights of the soldiers, who in fact had been provoked, made him temporarily unpopular but also marked him as one of the most principled radicals in the burgeoning movement for  John Adams   Continental Congress Declaration of Independence American independence. He had a penchant for doing the right thing, most especially when it made him unpopular. Continental Congress In the summer of 1774, Adams was elected to the Massachusetts delegation that joined the representatives from 12 of 13 colonies in Philadelphia at the First Continental Congress. He and his cousin, Samuel Adams, quickly became the leaders of the radical faction, which rejected the prospects for reconciliation with Britain. His “Novanglus” essays, published early in 1775, moved the constitutional argument forward another notch, insisting that Parliament lacked the authority not just to tax the colonies but also to legislate for them in any way. (Less than a year earlier, Thomas Jefferson had made a similar argument against parliamentary authority in A Summary View of the Rights of British America.) By the time the Second Continental Congress convened in 1775, Adams had gained the reputation as “the Atlas of independence.” Over the course of the following year, he made several major contributions to the patriot cause destined to ensure his place in American history. First, he nominated George Washington to serve as commander of the fledging Continental Army. Second, he selected Jefferson to draft the Declaration of Independence. (Both decisions were designed to ensure Virginia’s support for the revolution.) Third, he dominated the debate in the Congress on July 2–4, 1776, defending Jefferson’s draft of the declaration and demanding unanimous support for a decisive break with Great Britain. Moreover, he had written Thoughts on Government, which circulated throughout the colonies as the major guidebook for the drafting of new state constitutions (see primary source document: The Foundation of Government). In it, among other concerns, he contemplated the sort of representative assembly that would be most conducive to good government: It should be in miniature an exact portrait of the people at large. It should think, feel, reason, and act like them. That it may be the interest of this assembly to do strict justice at all times, it should be an equal representation, or, in other words, equal interests among the people should  John Adams   have equal interests in it. Great care should be taken to effect this, and to prevent unfair, partial, and corrupt elections. Adams remained the central figure of the Continental Congress for the following two years. He drafted the Plan of Treaties in July 1776, a document that provided the framework for a treaty with France and that almost inadvertently identified the strategic priorities that would shape American foreign policy over the next century. He was the unanimous choice to head the Board of War and Ordnance and was thereby made in effect a one-man war department responsible for raising and equipping the American army and creating from scratch an American navy. As the prospects for a crucial wartime alliance with France improved late in 1777, he was chosen to join Benjamin Franklin in Paris to conduct the negotiations. In February 1778 he sailed for Europe, accompanied by 10-year-old John Quincy. Foreign service By the time Adams arrived in Paris, the treaty creating an alliance with France had already been concluded. He quickly returned home in the summer of 1779, just in time to join the Massachusetts Constitutional Convention.

John Hancock
John Hancock, (born January 12, 1737, Braintree
(now in Quincy), Massachusetts—died October 8,
1793, Quincy, Massachusetts, U.S.), American
statesman who was a leading figure during the
Revolutionary War and the first signer of the U.S.
Declaration of Independence.
After graduating from Harvard (1754), Hancock entered a mercantile house in Boston
owned by his uncle Thomas Hancock, who later left him a large fortune. In 1765 he
became a selectman of Boston and from 1769 to 1774 was a member of the Massachusetts
General Court. He was chairman of the Boston town committee formed immediately after
the Boston Massacre in 1770 to demand the removal of British troops from the city.
In 1774 and 1775 Hancock was president of the first
and second provincial congresses, and he shared with
Samuel Adams the leadership of the Massachusetts
Patriots. With Adams he was forced to flee Lexington
for Philadelphia when warned in April 1775 that he
was being sought by General Thomas Gage’s troops,
approaching from Boston. Hancock was a member of
the Continental Congress from 1775 to 1780; he served as its president from May 1775 to
October 1777. He hoped to become commander in chief of the Continental Army, but
George Washington was selected instead.
Hancock was a member of the Massachusetts Constitutional Convention of 1780 and in the
same year was elected governor of the state. He served in Congress under the Articles of
Confederation in 1785–86 and then returned to the governorship. He presided over the
Massachusetts Convention of 1788 that ratified the federal Constitution, although he had
been unfriendly at first toward the document. Hancock died while serving his ninth term as
governor.

John I and John of Gaunt
John I
John I, bynames the Prince of Fond Memory, John of
Aviz, John the Great, and John the Bastard, Portuguese o
Principe de Boa Memória, João de Aviz, João o Grande,
and João o Bastardo, (born April 11, 1357, Lisbon—died
August 14, 1433, Lisbon), king of Portugal from 1385 to
1433, who preserved his country’s independence from
Castile and initiated Portugal’s overseas expansion. He was the founder of the Aviz, or
Joanina (Johannine), dynasty.
Early life
John was the illegitimate son of King Pedro I and Teresa Lourenço. At age six he was made
master of the military Order of Aviz; he received an ecclesiastical and military education,
probably at Aviz in Alentejo. On his father’s death, in 1367, his half-brother Ferdinand
became king and embarked on a calamitous rivalry with the new ruler of Castile, Henry II,
who finally forced Ferdinand to accept a Castilian marriage for his infant heiress, Beatriz,
thus compromising the future independence of Portugal.
When Ferdinand died, in 1383, his widow, Queen Leonor, submitted to the demand of her
Castilian son-in-law, John I, that he be recognized as king of Portugal. John of Aviz, who
had hitherto remained carefully in the background, though he had been arrested for a time
in 1382, was now persuaded by a group of young nationalists, led by Nuno Álvares Pereira,
to murder Queen Leonor’s favourite and adviser, the Galician João Fernandes Andeiro,
conde de Ourém. Popular support was at once stirred up for John, and Queen Leonor fled
from Lisbon, appealing to Castile for help. In May 1384 Castilian armies besieged John in
Lisbon until the outbreak of plague forced them to withdraw (September).
Election as king
John had been named defender of the realm, but in April 1385 representatives of the three
estates met in the Cortes (assembly) of Coimbra, and, after it had been demonstrated that
King Pedro’s elder surviving sons had not been legitimized, John was elected king. The
cities of Lisbon and Porto and the merchants and trade guilds enthusiastically backed him,
but much of the older nobility still favoured the Castilian succession. John and Nuno
Álvares, now his constable, marched northward and obtained the submission of the chief
places but returned on hearing that the Castilians were preparing a major invasion. As

Spanish forces entered central Portugal, John and Nuno Álvares advanced to bar the road to
Lisbon and won the famous Battle of Aljubarrota (August 14, 1385). This victory assured
Portugal’s independence and made John a desirable ally.
He had already received some English aid, and a small party of English archers had fought
for him at Aljubarrota, and he now concluded the Treaty of Windsor (May 9, 1386), which
became the cornerstone of the Anglo-Portuguese alliance. In consequence, John of Gaunt,
duke of Lancaster, arrived in Galicia, hoping, through his second marriage (1371), with the
daughter of King Pedro I of Castile, to realize his claim to the Castilian crown. John of
Aviz sealed the alliance by marrying, in February 1387, Lancaster’s daughter, Philippa. A
joint invasion of León was unsuccessful, and Lancaster withdrew. John of Aviz made a 10-
year truce with Castile in 1389, but frontier warfare with Castile was intermittent thereafter
until peace was finally made in 1411.
Consolidation and expansion
John’s elder sons had now reached the age at which they could become knights, and it was
ostensibly on their behalf that he organized an expedition against Ceuta, which fell in a day
(August 24, 1415). He had probably hoped to advance into Morocco and tap the African
caravan routes, but, instead, Ceuta became a beleaguered outpost supplied from the
Portuguese Algarve. This stimulated the maritime explorations, beginning with the
rediscovery and settlement of the Madeira Islands and the Azores.
John’s court now became a centre of culture, influenced through Queen Philippa by English
traditions. Of their sons, the inclita geração (“illustrious generation”), the eldest, Edward,
administered the kingdom under his father and was later king; the second, Pedro, travelled
through Europe and was regent after Edward’s death; and the third, Henry, known as the
Navigator, was the patron and organizer of the overseas discoveries. For them, John
introduced the title of duke into Portugal. Their sister, Isabel, married Philip the Good,
duke of Burgundy and count of Flanders, thus consolidating Portuguese interests in the
Low Countries. John’s natural son, Afonso, married the daughter of the constable Nuno
Álvares, and their descendants, the house of Bragança, became kings of Portugal from
1640.
John’s long struggle with Castile and the need to recompense a new aristocracy caused
serious financial difficulties, but he rallied his people around his throne and acquired a
reputation as a cautious leader and shrewd statesman. He rewarded the faithful trade guilds
by granting them permanent representation in the House of Twenty-four, in which two

members of each of the 12 major guilds were to sit. He also granted them a special
magistrate, the judge of the people. At Porto he ended the unpopular civil jurisdiction
exercised over the city by the bishop. He displayed his devotion by building near Leiria the
great Abbey of Batalha to commemorate his victory and serve as a pantheon. He was the
author of a work on hunting (Livro da montaria), his favourite pastime.
There is a portrait of John in the Museum of Ancient Art, Lisbon, and recumbent statues of
John and Philippa over their tomb at Batalha.

Jomo Kenyatta
Jomo Kenyatta
Jomo Kenyatta, original name Kamau Ngengi,
(born c. 1894, Ichaweri, British East Africa [now in
Kenya]—died August 22, 1978, Mombasa, Kenya),
African statesman and nationalist, the first prime
minister (1963–64) and then the first president (1964–
78) of independent Kenya.
Early life
Kenyatta was born as Kamau, son of Ngengi, at Ichaweri, southwest of Mount Kenya in the
East African highlands. His father was a leader of a small Kikuyu agricultural settlement.
About age 10 Kamau became seriously ill with jigger infections in his feet and one leg, and
he underwent successful surgery at a newly established Church of Scotland mission. This
was his initial contact with Europeans. Fascinated with what he had seen during his
recuperation, Kamau ran away from home to become a resident pupil at the mission. He
studied the Bible, English, mathematics, and carpentry and paid his fees by working as a
houseboy and cook for a European settler. In August 1914 he was baptized with the name
Johnstone Kamau. He was one of the earliest of the Kikuyu to leave the confines of his
own culture. And, like many others, Kamau soon left the mission life for the urban
attractions of Nairobi.
There he secured a job as a clerk in the Public Works Department, and he also adopted the
name Kenyatta, the Kikuyu term for a fancy belt that he wore. After serving briefly as an
interpreter in the High Court, Kenyatta transferred to a post with the Nairobi Town
Council. About this time he married and began to raise a family.
The first African political protest movement in Kenya against a white-settler-dominated
government began in 1921—the East Africa Association (EAA), led by an educated young
Kikuyu named Harry Thuku. Kenyatta joined the following year. One of the EAA’s main
purposes was to recover Kikuyu lands lost when Kenya became a British crown colony
(1920). The Africans were dispossessed, leaseholds of land were restricted to white settlers,
and native reservations were established. In 1925 the EAA disbanded as a result of
government pressures, and its members re-formed as the Kikuyu Central Association
(KCA). Three years later Kenyatta became this organization’s general secretary, though he
had to give up his municipal job as a consequence.

Entrance into full-time politics
In May 1928 Kenyatta launched a monthly Kikuyu-language newspaper called
Mwigithania (“He Who Brings Together”), aimed at gaining support from all sections of
the Kikuyu. The paper was mild in tone, preaching self-improvement, and was tolerated by
the government. But soon a new challenge appeared. A British commission recommended a
closer union of the three East African territories (Kenya, Uganda, Tanganyika). British
settler leaders supported the proposal, expecting that internal self-government might
follow. To the KCA such a prospect looked disastrous for Kikuyu interests; in February
1929 Kenyatta went to London to testify against the scheme, but in London the secretary of
state for colonies refused to meet with him. In March 1930 Kenyatta wrote an eloquent
letter in The Times of London setting out five issues championed by the KCA: (1) security
of land tenure and the return of lands allotted to European settlers, (2) increased
educational facilities, (3) repeal of hut taxes on women, which forced some to earn money
by prostitution, (4) African representation in the Legislative Council, and (5)
noninterference with traditional customs. He concluded by saying that the lack of these
measures “must inevitably result in a dangerous explosion—the one thing all sane men
wish to avoid.”
Again in 1931 Kenyatta’s testimony on the issue of closer union of the three colonies was
refused, despite the help of liberals in the House of Commons. In the end, however, the
government temporarily abandoned its plan for union. Kenyatta did manage to testify on
behalf of Kikuyu land claims in 1932 at hearings of the Carter Land Commission. The
commission decided to offer compensation for some appropriated territories but maintained
the “white highlands” policy, which restricted the Kikuyu to overcrowded reserves.
Kenyatta subsequently visited the Soviet Union (he spent two years at Moscow State
University) and traveled extensively through Europe; on his return to England he studied
anthropology under Bronisław Malinowski at the London School of Economics. His thesis
was revised and published in 1938 as Facing Mount Kenya, a study of the traditional life of
the Kikuyu characterized by both insight and a tinge of romanticism. This book signaled
another name change, to Jomo (“Burning Spear”) Kenyatta.
During the 1930s Kenyatta briefly joined the Communist Party, met other black nationalists
and writers, and organized protests against the Italian invasion of Ethiopia. The onset of
World War II temporarily cut him off from the KCA, which was banned by the Kenya
authorities as potentially subversive. Kenyatta maintained himself in England by lecturing

and working as a farm labourer, and he continued to produce political pamphlets
publicizing the Kikuyu cause.
Kenyatta helped organize the fifth Pan-African Congress, which met in Manchester,
England, on October 15–18, 1945, with W.E.B. Du Bois of the United States in the chair;
Kwame Nkrumah, the future leader of Ghana, was also present. Resolutions were passed
and plans discussed for mass nationalist movements to demand independence from colonial
rule.
Return to Kenya
Kenyatta returned to Kenya in September 1946 to take up leadership of the newly formed
Kenya African Union, of which he was elected president in June 1947. From the Kenya
African Teachers College, which he directed as an alternative to government educational
institutions, Kenyatta organized a mass nationalist party. But he had to produce tangible
results in return for the allegiance of his followers, and the colonial government in Kenya
was still dominated by unyielding settler interests. The “dangerous explosion” among the
Kikuyu that he had predicted in 1930 erupted as the Mau Mau rebellion of 1952, which
was directed against the presence of European settlers in Kenya and their ownership of
land. On October 21, 1952, Kenyatta was arrested on charges of having directed the Mau
Mau movement. Despite government efforts to portray Kenyatta’s trial as a criminal case, it
received worldwide publicity as a political proceeding. In April 1953 Kenyatta was
sentenced to a seven-year imprisonment for “managing the Mau Mau terrorist
organization.” He denied the charge then and afterward, maintaining that the Kenya
African Union’s political activities were not directly associated with Mau Mau violence.
The British government responded to African demands by gradually steering the country
toward African majority rule. In 1960 the principle of one man, one vote was conceded.
Kenyan nationalist leaders such as Tom Mboya and Oginga Odinga organized the Kenya
African National Union (KANU) and elected Kenyatta (still in detention despite having
completed his sentence) president in absentia; they refused to cooperate with the British
while Kenyatta was detained. In a press conference Kenyatta promised that “Europeans
would find a place in the future Kenya provided they took their place as ordinary citizens.”
Kenyatta was released in August 1961, and, at the London Conference early in 1962, he
negotiated the constitutional terms leading to Kenya’s independence. KANU won the
preindependence election in May 1963, forming a provisional government, and Kenya
celebrated its independence on December 12, 1963, with Kenyatta as prime minister. A

year later Kenya became a one-party republic when the main opposition party went into
voluntary liquidation. At the same time, Kenyatta became the first president of Kenya
under a new constitutional amendment. In this office he headed a strong central
government, and successive constitutional amendments increased his authority, giving him,
for instance, the power to arrest political opponents and detain them without trial if he
considered them dangerous to public order—a power he used effectively though
infrequently. To forestall any tribally based opposition, Kenyatta consistently appointed
members of different ethnic groups to his government, though he relied most heavily on his
fellow Kikuyu. In general, Kenya enjoyed remarkable political stability under Kenyatta’s
rule, though conflicts within KANU’s political leadership did occasionally break out
because of ideological differences and tribal rivalries.
Kenyatta early on rejected socialist calls for the nationalization of property and instead
preached a doctrine of personal and entrepreneurial effort, symbolized by his slogan
“Harambee,” or “Pulling together.” Besides relying heavily on a free-market economy, he
encouraged foreign investment from Western and other countries. Largely as a result of his
policies, Kenya’s gross national product grew almost fivefold from 1971 to 1981, and its
rate of economic growth was among the highest on the continent in the first two decades
after independence. But though economic growth benefited large numbers of people, it also
led to tremendous disparities of wealth, much of which was in the hands of Kenyatta’s
family and close associates. This concentration of wealth, along with an extremely high
rate of population growth, meant that most Kenyans did not realize a correspondingly large
increase in their living standards under Kenyatta’s leadership.
In foreign policy, Kenyatta’s government was consistently friendly toward the West.
Always—in spite of his imprisonment by the British authorities—one of the more pro-
British of African leaders, Kenyatta made Kenya the most stable black African country and
one of the most economically dynamic. After his death at Mombasa in 1978, Kenyatta was
succeeded by Daniel arap Moi, who continued most of his policies.

Early life Kenyatta was born as Kamau, son of Ngengi, at Ichaweri, southwest of Mount Kenya in the East African highlands. His father was a leader of a small Kikuyu agricultural settlement. About age 10 Kamau became seriously ill with jigger infections in his feet and one leg, and he underwent successful surgery at a newly established Church of Scotland mission. This was his initial contact with Europeans. Fascinated with what he had seen during his recuperation, Kamau ran away from home to become a resident pupil at the mission. He studied the Bible, English, mathematics, and carpentry and paid his fees by working as a houseboy and cook for a European settler. In August 1914 he was baptized with the name Johnstone Kamau. He was one of the earliest of the Kikuyu to leave the confines of his own culture. And, like many others, Kamau soon left the mission life for the urban attractions of Nairobi. There he secured a job as a clerk in the Public Works Department, and he also adopted the name Kenyatta, the Kikuyu term for a fancy belt that he wore. After serving briefly as an interpreter in the High Court, Kenyatta transferred to a post with the Nairobi Town Council. About this time he married and began to raise a family. The first African political protest movement in Kenya against a white-settler-dominated government began in 1921—the East Africa Association (EAA), led by an educated young Kikuyu named Harry Thuku. Kenyatta joined the following year. One of the EAA’s main purposes was to recover Kikuyu lands lost when Kenya became a British crown colony (1920). The Africans were dispossessed, leaseholds of land were restricted to white settlers, and native reservations were established. In 1925 the EAA disbanded as a result of government pressures, and its members re-formed as the Kikuyu Central Association (KCA). Three years later Kenyatta became this organization’s general secretary, though he had to give up his municipal job as a consequence. Jomo Kenyatta   Entrance into full-time politics In May 1928 Kenyatta launched a monthly Kikuyu-language newspaper called Mwigithania (“He Who Brings Together”), aimed at gaining support from all sections of the Kikuyu. The paper was mild in tone, preaching self-improvement, and was tolerated by the government. But soon a new challenge appeared. A British commission recommended a closer union of the three East African territories (Kenya, Uganda, Tanganyika). British settler leaders supported the proposal, expecting that internal self-government might follow. To the KCA such a prospect looked disastrous for Kikuyu interests; in February 1929 Kenyatta went to London to testify against the scheme, but in London the secretary of state for colonies refused to meet with him. In March 1930 Kenyatta wrote an eloquent letter in The Times of London setting out five issues championed by the KCA: (1) security of land tenure and the return of lands allotted to European settlers, (2) increased educational facilities, (3) repeal of hut taxes on women, which forced some to earn money by prostitution, (4) African representation in the Legislative Council, and (5) noninterference with traditional customs. He concluded by saying that the lack of these measures “must inevitably result in a dangerous explosion—the one thing all sane men wish to avoid.” Again in 1931 Kenyatta’s testimony on the issue of closer union of the three colonies was refused, despite the help of liberals in the House of Commons. In the end, however, the government temporarily abandoned its plan for union. Kenyatta did manage to testify on behalf of Kikuyu land claims in 1932 at hearings of the Carter Land Commission. The commission decided to offer compensation for some appropriated territories but maintained the “white highlands” policy, which restricted the Kikuyu to overcrowded reserves. Kenyatta subsequently visited the Soviet Union (he spent two years at Moscow State University) and traveled extensively through Europe; on his return to England he studied anthropology under Bronisław Malinowski at the London School of Economics. His thesis was revised and published in 1938 as Facing Mount Kenya, a study of the traditional life of the Kikuyu characterized by both insight and a tinge of romanticism. This book signaled another name change, to Jomo (“Burning Spear”) Kenyatta. During the 1930s Kenyatta briefly joined the Communist Party, met other black nationalists and writers, and organized protests against the Italian invasion of Ethiopia. The onset of World War II temporarily cut him off from the KCA, which was banned by the Kenya authorities as potentially subversive. Kenyatta maintained himself in England by lecturing  Jomo Kenyatta   and working as a farm labourer, and he continued to produce political pamphlets publicizing the Kikuyu cause. Kenyatta helped organize the fifth Pan-African Congress, which met in Manchester, England, on October 15–18, 1945, with W.E.B. Du Bois of the United States in the chair; Kwame Nkrumah, the future leader of Ghana, was also present. Resolutions were passed and plans discussed for mass nationalist movements to demand independence from colonial rule. Return to Kenya Kenyatta returned to Kenya in September 1946 to take up leadership of the newly formed Kenya African Union, of which he was elected president in June 1947. From the Kenya African Teachers College, which he directed as an alternative to government educational institutions, Kenyatta organized a mass nationalist party. But he had to produce tangible results in return for the allegiance of his followers, and the colonial government in Kenya was still dominated by unyielding settler interests. The “dangerous explosion” among the Kikuyu that he had predicted in 1930 erupted as the Mau Mau rebellion of 1952, which was directed against the presence of European settlers in Kenya and their ownership of land. On October 21, 1952, Kenyatta was arrested on charges of having directed the Mau Mau movement. Despite government efforts to portray Kenyatta’s trial as a criminal case, it received worldwide publicity as a political proceeding. In April 1953 Kenyatta was sentenced to a seven-year imprisonment for “managing the Mau Mau terrorist organization.” He denied the charge then and afterward, maintaining that the Kenya African Union’s political activities were not directly associated with Mau Mau violence.

Joseph Jenkins Roberts
Joseph Jenkins Roberts, (born March 15, 1809,
Petersburg, Va., U.S.—died Feb. 24, 1876, Monrovia,
Liberia), American-born, first president of Liberia
(1848–56).
A native of Virginia, Roberts was the son of free
“blacks” whose heritage was more than seven-eighths
white. At the age of 20 he immigrated to Liberia with his mother and younger brothers,
became a merchant, and also became an unofficial aide to the white governor of the colony,
Thomas H. Buchanan, a member of the American Colonization Society, which sought the
return of American freedmen to Africa. On Buchanan’s death in 1842, Roberts was
appointed the first black governor of the colony.
In efforts to establish the political and economic stability of the colony, Roberts and other
colonists sought treaties with native tribes and recognition from foreign powers. In 1847
they proclaimed the new republic of Liberia; Roberts was elected the first president. In

Joseph Kasavubu
Joseph Kasavubu, (born 1910?, Tshela, Belgian
Congo [now Democratic Republic of the Congo]—
died March 24, 1969, Boma), statesman and first
president of the independent Congo republic from
1960 to 1965, who shortly after independence in 1960
ousted the Congo’s first premier, Patrice Lumumba,
after the breakdown of order in the country.
Educated by Roman Catholic missionaries, Kasavubu became a lay teacher. In 1942 he
entered the civil service; he attained the rank of chief clerk, the highest position open to
Congolese in the Belgian colonial administration.
An early leader in the Congo’s independence movement, Kasavubu during the late 1940s
held important offices in Congolese cultural societies and alumni associations that were
actually political organizations operating in defiance of Belgian authorities. As a member
of the powerful Bakongo (or Kongo), one of the largest ethnic groups in the country,
Kasavubu in the 1950s sought an independent Congo with a federal structure that would
ensure a certain measure of Bakongo autonomy.
Kasavubu became president (1955) of Abako (Alliance des Ba-Kongo), the powerful
cultural-political association of the Bakongo. In 1957 Abako candidates swept the first
municipal elections permitted by Belgian authorities in Léopoldville (now Kinshasa), and
Kasavubu was elected mayor of the Dendale district.
In the Congo’s first national elections in 1960, Lumumba’s party outpolled Kasavubu’s
Abako and its allies, but neither side could form a parliamentary coalition. As a
compromise measure, Kasavubu and Lumumba formed an uneasy partnership with the
former as president and the latter as premier.
Shortly after independence, Congo was racked by an army mutiny, Belgian military
intervention to protect the remaining Belgian residents, and the secession of the province of
Katanga under Moise Tshombe. United Nations aid proved ineffective in restoring order in
the country, and there were reports that Premier Lumumba had accepted offers of Soviet
military aid to prop up the faltering central government. With the backing of the army
under Colonel Joseph Mobutu (later Mobutu Sese Seko), Kasavubu dismissed Lumumba

and appointed a new government. Kasavubu then tacitly supported Mobuto’s first coup in
late 1960 and later engineered the accession of Tshombe to the premiership in 1964.
Kasavubu’s role in Congolese politics effectively ended, however, with Mobutu’s second,
and final overthrow of the government in 1965. Kasavubu then retired to his farm at Boma
on the lower Congo River.

José Antonio Páez
José Antonio Páez, (born June 13, 1790, Curpa, near
Acarigua, New Granada [now in Venezuela]—died
May 6, 1873, New York, N.Y., U.S.), Venezuelan
soldier and politician, a leader in the country’s
independence movement and its first president. In the
crucial early years of Venezuelan independence, he
led the country as a dictator.
Páez was a mestizo (mixed American Indian and European ancestry) llanero, one of the
horsemen of the plains. Beginning as a ranch hand, he quickly acquired both land and
cattle. In 1810 he joined the revolutionary movement against Spain as the leader of a band
of llaneros. Becoming chief Venezuelan commander to Simón Bolívar, the liberator of
northern South America, Páez and his men helped secure victories at Carabobo (1821) and
Puerto Cabello (1823) that resulted in the complete withdrawal of the Spanish. In 1826,
after rebelling against the authority of Gran Colombia, of which Venezuela was a province,
Páez became the chief military and civil leader of his country. In 1827 he again recognized
Bolívar as president of Gran Colombia, but two years later he led the movement that
resulted in Venezuela’s becoming a sovereign nation.
Páez was designated provisional president in 1830 and began a constitutional term the
following year; thereafter he controlled the country either as chief executive (1831–35;
1839–43) or as a power behind the presidency until the late 1840s. He leveraged his
prestige and military prowess to unify the country as it underwent a profound political and
economic transformation. Among other actions, he curbed the power of the church in
secular affairs but supported its religious authority.
In 1848–49 Páez rebelled unsuccessfully against the rule of Pres. José Tadeo Monagas; he
was imprisoned and forced into exile in 1850. He returned to Venezuela during another
period of civil unrest in the late 1850s, and in 1861–63 he ruled as a severely repressive
dictator, only to be forced again into exile. Páez spent most of his remaining years in New
York City, where he published his autobiography in 1867–69. His remains were placed in
Venezuela’s Panteón Nacional in 1888.

José Bonifácio de Andrada e Silva
José Bonifácio de Andrada e Silva, (born c. 1763,
Santos, Braz.—died April 6, 1838, Niterói, Braz.),
Brazilian statesman who played a key role in Brazil’s
attainment of independence from Portugal. He is
known to Brazilians as the “Patriarch of
Independence.”
Andrada went to Portugal as a student and became a distinguished scholar there, earning an
international reputation as a naturalist and geologist. He remained in Portugal until he was
56, serving as a professor at the University of Coimbra and as the permanent secretary of
the Lisbon Academy. He was deeply influenced by the principles of the Enlightenment.
Returning to Brazil in 1819, Andrada devoted himself to politics and quickly became the
leading intellectual advocate of Brazilian independence from Portugal. More importantly,
he became the chief adviser to the young prince regent, Dom Pedro (later the emperor
Pedro I). He headed the ministry formed in January 1822 by Dom Pedro and supported
Pedro in his determination that Brazil should be independent. After Pedro proclaimed
Brazil’s independence from Portugal (Sept. 7, 1822), Andrada became prime minister of
the new empire of Brazil.
In the constituent assembly of 1823, Andrada’s liberal political principles led him to oppose
Pedro’s Portuguese advisers, and consequently Andrada was exiled until 1829. He was then
allowed to aid Pedro I once again, and he worked for the imperial cause even after Pedro’s
abdication (April 7, 1831). He became tutor to the child emperor Pedro II, and the liberal
education that he gave Pedro II helped the latter become an effective and enlightened
monarch. After being arrested in 1833 for political intrigue, Andrada retired from public
life.

José de San Martín
José de San Martín
José de San Martín, (born February 25, 1778,
Yapeyú, viceroyalty of Río de la Plata [now in
Argentina]—died August 17, 1850, Boulogne-sur-
Mer, France), Argentine soldier, statesman, and
national hero who helped lead the revolutions against
Spanish rule in Argentina (1812), Chile (1818), and
Peru (1821).
Early life and career
San Martín’s father, Juan de San Martín, a Spanish professional soldier, was administrator
of Yapeyú, formerly a Jesuit mission station in Guaraní Indian territory, on the northern
frontier of Argentina. His mother, Gregoria Matorras, was also Spanish. The family
returned to Spain when José was six. From 1785 to 1789 he was educated at the Seminary
of Nobles in Madrid, leaving there to begin his military career as a cadet in the Murcia
infantry regiment. For the next 20 years he was a loyal officer of the Spanish monarch,
fighting against the Moors in Oran (1791); against the British (1798), who held him captive
for more than a year; and against the Portuguese in the War of the Oranges (1801). He was
made captain in 1804.
The turning point in San Martín’s career came in 1808, following Napoleon’s occupation of
Spain and the subsequent patriotic uprising against the French there. For two years he
served the Sevilla (Seville) junta that was conducting the war on behalf of the imprisoned
Spanish king Ferdinand VII. He was promoted to the rank of lieutenant colonel for his
conduct in the Battle of Bailén (1808) and was elevated to command of the Sagunto
Dragoons after the Battle of Albuera (1811). Instead of taking up his new post, he sought
permission to go to Lima, the capital of the Viceroyalty of Peru, but traveled by way of
London to Buenos Aires, which had become the principal centre of resistance in South
America to the Sevilla junta and its successor, the Cádiz-based Council of Regency. There,
in the year 1812, San Martín was given the task of organizing a corps of grenadiers against
the Spanish royalists centred in Peru who threatened the revolutionary government in
Argentina.
One possible explanation for this startling change of allegiance on the part of a soldier who
had sworn fealty to Spain is that it was prompted by British sympathizers with the

San Martín's army crossing the
Andes
independence movement in Spanish America and that San Martín was recruited through the
agency of James Duff, 4th earl of Fife, who had fought in Spain (and who caused San
Martín to be made a freeman of Banff, Scotland). In later years, San Martín averred that he
had sacrificed his career in Spain because he had responded to the call of his native land,
and this is the view taken by Argentinian historians. Undoubtedly, peninsular Spanish
prejudice against anyone born in the Indies must have rankled throughout his career in
Spain and caused him to identify himself with the creole revolutionaries.
In the service of the Buenos Aires government, San Martín distinguished himself as a
trainer and leader of soldiers, and, after winning a skirmish against loyalist forces at San
Lorenzo, on the right bank of the Paraná River (February 3, 1813), he was sent to Tucumán
to reinforce, and ultimately replace, Gen. Manuel Belgrano, who was being hard pressed by
forces of the viceroy of Peru. San Martín recognized that the Río de la Plata provinces
would never be secure so long as the royalists held Lima, but he perceived the military
impossibility of reaching the centre of viceregal power by way of the conventional
overland route through Upper Peru (modern Bolivia). He therefore quietly prepared the
masterstroke that was his supreme contribution to the liberation of southern South America.
First, he disciplined and trained the army around Tucumán so that, with the assistance of
gaucho guerrilleros, they would be capable of a holding operation. Then, on the pretense of
ill health, he got himself appointed governor intendant of the province of Cuyo, the capital
of which was Mendoza, the key to the routes across the Andes. There, he set about creating
an army that would link up overland with the soldiers of the patriotic government in Chile
and then proceed by sea to attack Peru.
Campaign across the Andes
To his disappointment, when the first stage of this
plan was nearing completion, loyalist forces
recaptured Chile (although the Chilean liberator,
Bernardo O’Higgins, was able to escape to Mendoza).
This made it necessary for San Martín to fight his
way westward across the formidable barrier of the
Andes. This was accomplished between January 18
and February 8, 1817, partly by a double bluff, which
caused the Spanish commander to divide his forces in order to guard all possible routes,
and more especially by careful generalship that ensured the maximum concentration of
force at the enemy’s weakest point, backed by adequate supplies. San Martín’s skill in
leading his men through the defiles, chasms, and passes—often 10,000 to 12,000 feet

(3,000 to 4,000 metres) above sea level—of the Andean cordillera has caused him to be
ranked with Hannibal and Napoleon. On February 12 he surprised and defeated the
royalists at Casas de Chacabuco and took Santiago, where he refused the offer of the
governorship of Chile in favour of O’Higgins (who became supreme director) because he
did not wish to be diverted from his main objective, the capture of Lima. Nevertheless, it
took him more than a year to clear the country of royalist troops. He finally routed the
principal remaining armies, some 5,000, on April 5, 1818, at the Battle of Maipú.
The next stage of San Martín’s plan involved the creation of the Chilean navy and the
accumulation of troop ships. This was accomplished, despite a shortage of funds, by
August 1820, when the rather shoddy fleet, consisting mainly of armed merchant ships,
under the command of Thomas Cochrane (later 10th earl of Dundonald), left Valparaíso for
the Peruvian coast. Cochrane, whom San Martín found a cantankerous colleague, had
failed the year before to take the chief port, Callao, which was well-defended. The port was
therefore blockaded, and the troops were landed to the south near Pisco; from this point
they could threaten Lima from the landward side. True to his cautious nature, San Martín
resisted the temptation to assault the capital, which was defended by a superior force, and
waited for almost a year, until the royalists, despairing of assistance from Ferdinand VII
(who had since been restored to the Spanish throne), withdrew to the mountains. San
Martín and his army then entered Lima, the independence of Peru was proclaimed on July
28, 1821, and the victorious revolutionary commander was made protector.
San Martín’s position was nevertheless insecure. He had broken with his supporters in
Buenos Aires when, against their wishes, he insisted on pressing on to Lima; he was unsure
of the loyalty of the Peruvian people and of the backing of some of his officers, many of
whom suspected him of dictatorial or monarchical ambitions; and he lacked the forces to
subdue the royalist remnants in the interior. Moreover, Simón Bolívar, who had liberated
the northern provinces of South America, had annexed Guayaquil, a port and province that
San Martín had hoped would opt for incorporation in Peru. He therefore decided to
confront Bolívar.
Meeting with Bolívar
The two victorious generals met on July 26, 1822, in Guayaquil, where Bolívar had already
taken control. What passed between them in their secret discussions is unknown, but what
is clear is that San Martín hurried back to Lima, a disappointed man. There, seriously ill,
faced by recriminations and overt disaffection, he resigned his protectorship on September
20. In a message to the Peruvian Congress he left a farsighted warning: “The presence of a

successful soldier (no matter how disinterested) is dangerous to the States that have just
been constituted.” The rest of his life was spent in exile with his daughter, in Brussels,
Paris, and Boulogne-sur-Mer, wisely avoiding any further involvement in the anarchic
situations that marred the early history of the newly independent nations. He died in
Boulogne-sur-Mer in 1850.
Legacy
San Martín’s contribution to the cause of independence was his military skill. The boldness
of his plan to attack the viceroyalty of Lima by crossing the Andes to Chile and going on
by sea, as well as the patience and determination with which he executed it, was
undoubtedly the decisive factor in the defeat of Spanish power in southern South America.
Whether at Guayaquil he consciously made a great renunciation of personal ambition so
that Bolívar, and with him the cause of independence, might triumph, or whether he went
into voluntary exile because Bolívar made it clear that he was not prepared to help Peru so
long as San Martín remained in control, remains an unresolved historical problem.

Early life and career San Martín’s father, Juan de San Martín, a Spanish professional soldier, was administrator of Yapeyú, formerly a Jesuit mission station in Guaraní Indian territory, on the northern frontier of Argentina. His mother, Gregoria Matorras, was also Spanish. The family returned to Spain when José was six. From 1785 to 1789 he was educated at the Seminary of Nobles in Madrid, leaving there to begin his military career as a cadet in the Murcia infantry regiment. For the next 20 years he was a loyal officer of the Spanish monarch, fighting against the Moors in Oran (1791); against the British (1798), who held him captive for more than a year; and against the Portuguese in the War of the Oranges (1801). He was made captain in 1804. The turning point in San Martín’s career came in 1808, following Napoleon’s occupation of Spain and the subsequent patriotic uprising against the French there. For two years he served the Sevilla (Seville) junta that was conducting the war on behalf of the imprisoned Spanish king Ferdinand VII. He was promoted to the rank of lieutenant colonel for his conduct in the Battle of Bailén (1808) and was elevated to command of the Sagunto Dragoons after the Battle of Albuera (1811). Instead of taking up his new post, he sought permission to go to Lima, the capital of the Viceroyalty of Peru, but traveled by way of London to Buenos Aires, which had become the principal centre of resistance in South America to the Sevilla junta and its successor, the Cádiz-based Council of Regency. There, in the year 1812, San Martín was given the task of organizing a corps of grenadiers against the Spanish royalists centred in Peru who threatened the revolutionary government in Argentina. One possible explanation for this startling change of allegiance on the part of a soldier who had sworn fealty to Spain is that it was prompted by British sympathizers with the  José de San Martín   San Martín's army crossing the Andes independence movement in Spanish America and that San Martín was recruited through the agency of James Duff, 4th earl of Fife, who had fought in Spain (and who caused San Martín to be made a freeman of Banff, Scotland). In later years, San Martín averred that he had sacrificed his career in Spain because he had responded to the call of his native land, and this is the view taken by Argentinian historians. Undoubtedly, peninsular Spanish prejudice against anyone born in the Indies must have rankled throughout his career in Spain and caused him to identify himself with the creole revolutionaries. In the service of the Buenos Aires government, San Martín distinguished himself as a trainer and leader of soldiers, and, after winning a skirmish against loyalist forces at San Lorenzo, on the right bank of the Paraná River (February 3, 1813), he was sent to Tucumán to reinforce, and ultimately replace, Gen. Manuel Belgrano, who was being hard pressed by forces of the viceroy of Peru. San Martín recognized that the Río de la Plata provinces would never be secure so long as the royalists held Lima, but he perceived the military impossibility of reaching the centre of viceregal power by way of the conventional overland route through Upper Peru (modern Bolivia). He therefore quietly prepared the masterstroke that was his supreme contribution to the liberation of southern South America. First, he disciplined and trained the army around Tucumán so that, with the assistance of gaucho guerrilleros, they would be capable of a holding operation. Then, on the pretense of ill health, he got himself appointed governor intendant of the province of Cuyo, the capital of which was Mendoza, the key to the routes across the Andes. There, he set about creating an army that would link up overland with the soldiers of the patriotic government in Chile and then proceed by sea to attack Peru. Campaign across the Andes To his disappointment, when the first stage of this plan was nearing completion, loyalist forces recaptured Chile (although the Chilean liberator, Bernardo O’Higgins, was able to escape to Mendoza). This made it necessary for San Martín to fight his way westward across the formidable barrier of the Andes. This was accomplished between January 18 and February 8, 1817, partly by a double bluff, which caused the Spanish commander to divide his forces in order to guard all possible routes, and more especially by careful generalship that ensured the maximum concentration of force at the enemy’s weakest point, backed by adequate supplies. San Martín’s skill in leading his men through the defiles, chasms, and passes—often 10,000 to 12,000 feet  José de San Martín   (3,000 to 4,000 metres) above sea level—of the Andean cordillera has caused him to be ranked with Hannibal and Napoleon. On February 12 he surprised and defeated the royalists at Casas de Chacabuco and took Santiago, where he refused the offer of the governorship of Chile in favour of O’Higgins (who became supreme director) because he did not wish to be diverted from his main objective, the capture of Lima. Nevertheless, it took him more than a year to clear the country of royalist troops. He finally routed the principal remaining armies, some 5,000, on April 5, 1818, at the Battle of Maipú.

José Gervasio Artigas, (born June 19, 1764,
probably Montevideo [now in Uruguay]—died
September 23, 1850, Ibiray, near Asunción,
Paraguay), soldier and revolutionary leader who is
regarded as the father of Uruguayan independence,
although that goal was not attained until several years
after he had been forced into exile.
As a youth Artigas was a gaucho, or cowboy, in the interior of what is now Uruguay. In
1797 he entered the Spanish military forces, which then were mainly engaged in
exterminating bandits. Several years later (1810) he offered his services to the Buenos
Aires junta that was leading an independence movement against Spain. After winning a
brilliant victory at Las Piedras, he besieged Spanish-held Montevideo for a time. In the face
of superior Portuguese forces (called in from Brazil by the Spaniards), Artigas led a
dramatic withdrawal of about 16,000 people from the region into Argentine territory.
Artigas then became the champion of federalism against the efforts of Buenos Aires to
assert centralized control over the whole Río de la Plata region. In 1814 this struggle
became a civil war. At first Artigas ruled over about 350,000 square miles (900,000 square
km) of what is now Uruguay and central Argentina. His hold, however, was weakened by
his insistence on decentralized government and was finally broken by a Portuguese
invasion, which he resisted for three years. From 1820 he lived in exile in Paraguay; the
independence of his native Uruguay was finally achieved on Aug. 27, 1828.

José María Morelos
José María Morelos, in full José María Morelos y Pavón, (born September 30, 1765,
Valladolid, Mexico—died December 22, 1815, San Cristóbal), revolutionary priest who
assumed leadership of the Mexican independence movement after Miguel Hidalgo’s 1810
rebellion and subsequent execution.
Morelos was a child of mixed ethnic heritage in a society in which fine-line categorical
distinctions were drawn on the basis of the composition of one’s ethnic background.
Generally, he is characterized as having been a pardo—that is, the progeny of mixed
European, Native American, and African heritage. He is also sometimes characterized as
mulato pardo, which, under another classification scheme, is defined as a person of half
Native American and half African descent.
Born in poverty, Morelos worked as a muleteer and cowhand until at the age of 25 he
began study for the priesthood at the Colegio de San Nicolás in Valladolid. He held several
obscure curacies serving mostly Indians and mestizos. Early in 1811 he joined Hidalgo’s
insurrection, and after Hidalgo’s death (July 31) he took command of the movement in
southern Mexico. Between 1812 and 1815 he controlled most of Mexico southwest of
Mexico City, holding at one time or another Acapulco, Oaxaca, Tehuacán, and Cuautla
(Santiago Cuautla). Lacking manpower to consolidate control over all of the region after
his victories, he turned increasingly to guerrilla tactics.
Morelos called the Congress of Chilpancingo in 1813 to form a government and draft a
constitution. In November the congress declared Mexico’s independence, and in October
1814 at Apatzingán it promulgated an egalitarian constitution. The congress was safe,
however, only so long as it moved from place to place under the protection of Morelos’s
nomadic army. Finally, royalist forces caught up with the insurgents, but Morelos fought a
rearguard action allowing most of the revolutionary government to escape. He was
captured, however, and, after being defrocked, was shot as a traitor.

Lacking manpower to consolidate control over all of the region after his victories, he turned increasingly to guerrilla tactics. Morelos called the Congress of Chilpancingo in 1813 to form a government and draft a constitution. In November the congress declared Mexico’s independence, and in October 1814 at Apatzingán it promulgated an egalitarian constitution. The congress was safe, however, only so long as it moved from place to place under the protection of Morelos’s nomadic army. Finally, royalist forces caught up with the insurgents, but Morelos fought a rearguard action allowing most of the revolutionary government to escape. He was captured, however, and, after being defrocked, was shot as a traitor. This article was most recently revised and updated by Jeff Wallenfeldt. José María Morelos",

José Miguel Carrera
José Miguel Carrera, (born October 15/16, 1785,
Santiago, Chile—died September 4, 1821, Mendoza,
Argentina), aristocratic leader in the early struggle for the
independence of Chile and first president of that country.
By a coup d’état in 1811, Carrera placed himself at the
head of the national government and later the same year made himself dictator. Soon,
however, internecine strife developed in the independence movement that permitted the
restoration of Spanish rule. Bernardo O’Higgins was elevated to the leadership of the
forces opposing Carrera, who in 1813 was removed from power by the junta in favour of
O’Higgins; early in 1814, however, Carrera regained control. During the ensuing invasion
of Spanish forces from Peru, both Carrera and O’Higgins were defeated at Rancagua
(October 1814). Carrera sought aid against his opponents, first in Buenos Aires and then, in
1815, in the United States. On his return to Argentina in 1816, he was not allowed to
continue into Chile, and so he helped Argentine provincial chiefs in sporadic revolts against
the government in Buenos Aires. Eventually betrayed by his own men, he was captured and
shot.

Ramos-Horta, José
José Ramos-Horta
José Ramos-Horta, (born December 26, 1949, Dili,
East Timor), East Timorese political activist who,
along with Bishop Carlos F.X. Belo, received the
1996 Nobel Prize for Peace for their efforts to bring
peace and independence to East Timor, a former
Portuguese possession that was under Indonesian
control from 1975 to 1999. Ramos-Horta served as
prime minister of East Timor from 2006 to 2007 and as president from 2007 to 2012.
Ramos-Horta’s mother was a native Timorese, and his father was a Portuguese national
who was deported to East Timor for participating in a revolt against the dictator António
Salazar. After studying law in the United States, Ramos-Horta returned to East Timor (then
under Portuguese rule) to participate in the independence movement. His activities brought
the ire of the Portuguese rulers, and he was forced to flee to Mozambique in 1970.
Returning in 1972, Ramos-Horta sided with the pro-independence Fretilin faction in the
East Timor civil war. The Fretilin gained control of the government on November 28, 1975,
and declared East Timor’s independence; Ramos-Horta was named foreign minister.
However, nine days later Indonesia invaded East Timor, and Ramos-Horta was again
forced into exile.
Eventually settling in Sydney, Australia, Ramos-Horta joined the faculty of the University
of New South Wales. From that position he became one of the primary voices for East
Timor in the international arena, becoming East Timor’s de facto ambassador to the United
Nations (UN). He spoke out against human rights violations by the occupying Indonesian
military forces and promoted a peace plan to end the violence in his country. After
receiving the Nobel Prize for Peace in 1996, he gave the award and prize money to a
program called Microcredit for the Poor. He returned home in 1999 after the UN Security
Council established the UN Transition Administration in East Timor.
Ramos-Horta continued to urge forgiveness and reconciliation and was appointed East
Timor’s foreign minister in 2000; he continued in that office after East Timor achieved full
sovereignty in 2002. In 2006 fighting erupted in the country after Prime Minister Mari
Alkatiri fired hundreds of soldiers who had gone on strike to protest against discrimination.
Criticized for his handling of the crisis, Alkatiri resigned and was replaced by Ramos-
Horta, who took office in July 2006. In May 2007 Ramos-Horta was elected president,

garnering nearly 70 percent of the vote. The following year he was seriously injured after
being shot by rebels outside his home in Dili, East Timor. He recovered, and he served out
the rest of his term. Ramos-Horta failed in his bid for a second term, however, when, in
March 2012, he came in third in the first round of presidential voting. He was succeeded in
May by former guerrilla leader and later East Timor military commander Taur Matan Ruak
(José Maria Vasconcelos).

Juan Pablo Duarte
Juan Pablo Duarte, (born 1813, Santo Domingo,
Hispaniola [now in Dominican Republic]—died
1876, Caracas, Venez.), father of Dominican
independence, who lost power after the struggle
succeeded and spent the end of his life in exile.
Duarte, who was sent to Europe for his education
(1828–33), became determined to free the eastern part of Hispaniola from Haitian
domination. On his return to the island he and several other patriots organized a secret
society, La Trinitaria, to work toward independence and to stimulate liberalism. His first
attempt to oust the Haitians in 1843 collapsed, and he fled the country; but his followers
succeeded in overthrowing the Haitians the next year.
In February 1844 Duarte returned, and the Dominican
Republic proclaimed its independence. It was not
Duarte’s followers, however, who ultimately
triumphed, but a local caudillo (military dictator),
Pedro Santana. The defeated Duarte was exiled and
took up residence in Caracas, Venez. He left Caracas
for his homeland only once, during the War of Restoration (1864) against Spain, after
which he was sent on a diplomatic mission for one year.

Juan Álvarez, (born 1790, Concepción de Atoyac, Mex.—died Aug. 21, 1867, Acapulco),
revolutionary leader for more than 40 years, before and after the end of Spanish rule, and
provisional president of Mexico in 1855.
A landowner of mestizo ancestry, Álvarez in 1811 joined José María Morelos in an
unsuccessful campaign for independence from Spain. He was prominent in Antonio López
de Santa Anna’s revolt of 1822–23, which overthrew the first ruler of independent Mexico,
Agustín de Iturbide.
In 1847 Álvarez fought in the war against the United States. Two years later he became
governor of the new state of Guerrero, ostensibly as a liberal. When Santa Anna
reestablished his dictatorship in 1853, however, Álvarez accommodated himself to this
situation as long as his hegemony in Guerrero was not threatened. In 1854, when Santa
Anna tried to secure direct rule over Guerrero, Álvarez started a rebellion at Ayutla. After
Santa Anna had gone into exile, Álvarez assumed control of the government and soon
resigned in favour of Ignacio Comonfort, his ally in the fight against Santa Anna. The work
of Álvarez and Comonfort resulted in the liberal trend known as La Reforma (“The
Reform”), which culminated in the constitution of 1857.

Julius Nyerere -- Britannica Online Encyclopedia
https://www.britannica.com/print/article/423105

Julius Nyerere
Julius Nyerere
Julius Nyerere, in full Julius Kambarage Nyerere,
also called Mwalimu (Swahili: “Teacher”), (born
March 1922, Butiama, Tanganyika [now in Tanzania]
—died October 14, 1999, London, England), first
prime minister of independent Tanganyika (1961),
who later became the first president of the new state
of Tanzania (1964). Nyerere was also the major force
behind the Organization of African Unity (OAU; now the African Union).
Nyerere was a son of the chief of the small Zanaki ethnic group. He was educated at Tabora
Secondary School and Makerere College in Kampala, Uganda. A convert to Roman
Catholicism, he taught in several Roman Catholic schools before going to Edinburgh
University. He was the first Tanganyikan to study at a British university. He graduated with
an M.A. in history and economics in 1952 and returned to Tanganyika to teach.
By the time Nyerere entered politics, the old League
of Nations mandate that Britain had exercised in
Tanganyika had been converted into a United Nations
trusteeship, with independence the ultimate goal.
Seeking to hasten the process of emancipation,
Nyerere joined the Tanganyika African Association,
quickly becoming its president in 1953. In 1954 he converted the organization into the
politically oriented Tanganyika African National Union (TANU). Under Nyerere’s
leadership the organization espoused peaceful change, social equality, and racial harmony
and rejected tribalism and all forms of racial and ethnic discrimination.
In 1955 and 1956 he journeyed to the United Nations in New York City as a petitioner to
the Trusteeship Council and the Fourth Committee on trusts and non-self-governing
territories. After a debate that ended in his being granted a hearing, he asked for a target
date for the independence of Tanganyika. The British administration rejected the demand,
but a dialogue was begun that established Nyerere as the preeminent nationalist spokesman
for his country.
The British administration nominated him a member of the Tanganyikan Legislative
Council, but he resigned in 1957 in protest against the slowness of progress toward
1/16/23, 2:46 PM

2/4
independence. In elections held in 1958–59, Nyerere and TANU won a large number of
seats on the Legislative Council. In a subsequent election in August 1960, his organization
managed to win 70 of 71 seats in Tanganyika’s new Legislative Assembly. Progress toward
independence owed much to the understanding and mutual trust that developed during the
course of negotiations between Nyerere and the British governor, Sir Richard Turnbull.
Tanganyika finally gained responsible self-government in September 1960, and Nyerere
became chief minister at this time. Tanganyika became independent on December 9, 1961,
with Nyerere as its first prime minister. The next month, however, he resigned from this
position to devote his time to writing and synthesizing his views of government and of
African unity. One of Nyerere’s more important works was a paper called “Ujamaa—The
Basis for African Socialism,” which later served as the philosophical basis for the Arusha
Declaration (1967). When Tanganyika became a republic in 1962, he was elected president,
and in 1964 he became president of the United Republic of Tanzania (Tanganyika and
Zanzibar).
Nyerere was reelected president of Tanzania in 1965 and was returned to serve three more
successive five-year terms before he resigned as president in 1985 and handed over his
office to his successor, Ali Hassan Mwinyi. From independence on Nyerere also headed
Tanzania’s only political party, Chama Cha Mapinduzi (CCM).
As outlined in his political program, the Arusha Declaration, Nyerere was committed to the
creation of an egalitarian socialist society based on cooperative agriculture in Tanzania. He
collectivized village farmlands, carried out mass literacy campaigns, and instituted free and
universal education. He also emphasized Tanzania’s need to become economically self-
sufficient rather than remain dependent on foreign aid and foreign investment. Nyerere
termed his socialist experimentation ujamaa (Swahili: “familyhood”), a name that
emphasized the blend of economic cooperation, racial and tribal harmony, and moralistic
self-sacrifice that he sought to achieve. Tanzania became a one-party state, though certain
democratic opportunities were permitted within that framework.
As a major force behind the modern Pan-African movement and one of the founders in
1963 of the OAU, Nyerere was a key figure in African events in the 1970s. He was a strong
advocate of economic and political measures in dealing with the apartheid policies of South
Africa. Nyerere was chairman of a group of five frontline African presidents who
advocated the overthrow of white supremacy in Rhodesia (now Zimbabwe), South Africa,
and South West Africa/Namibia (now Namibia).

Nyerere’s concerns on the domestic front were dominated by economic hardships and by
difficulties between Nyerere and Idi Amin of Uganda. In 1972 Nyerere denounced Amin
when the latter announced the expulsion of all Asians from Uganda. When Ugandan troops
occupied a small border area of Tanzania in 1978, Nyerere pledged to bring about the
downfall of Amin, and in 1979 the Tanzanian army invaded Uganda in support of a local
movement to overthrow him. Nyerere’s intervention helped to unseat Amin and brought
about the return to power in Uganda of Milton Obote in 1980.
Though enthusiastically adopted by his countrymen and steadfastly supported by
sympathetic western European nations, Nyerere’s socialist policies failed to spur economic
development in Tanzania. At the time of his resignation in 1985, Tanzania was still one of
the world’s poorest countries, with a per capita income of about U.S. $250. Agriculture
remained at the subsistence level, and the country’s industrial and transportation
infrastructures were chronically underdeveloped. One-third of the national budget was
supplied by foreign aid. Tanzania had one of the highest literacy rates in Africa, however,
and the society was both politically stable and notably free of economic inequalities.
Nyerere himself remained committed to socialist policies throughout his political career.
Nyerere continued as chairman of the CCM until 1990. Thereafter he assumed the role of
elder statesman and was regularly called upon to act as arbiter in international crises such
as those in Rwanda and Burundi.
Soft-spoken, unpretentious, small of stature, and quick to laugh, Julius Nyerere was widely
credited with impressive oratorical skills and unusual powers of political perception. His
thoughts, essays, and speeches are collected in his books, Uhuru na Umoja (1967; Freedom
and Unity), Uhuru na Ujamaa (1968; Freedom and Socialism), and Uhuru na Maendeleo
(1973; Freedom and Development). He also translated two plays by William Shakespeare,
The Merchant of Venice and Julius Caesar, into Swahili.

Jón Sigurdsson
Jón Sigurdsson, (born June 17, 1811, western
Iceland—died Dec. 7, 1879, Copenhagen, Den.),
Icelandic scholar and statesman who collected and
edited many Old Norse sagas and documents. He was
also the leader of the 19th-century struggle for
Icelandic self-government under Denmark.
Sigurdsson was educated in classical philology, ancient history, and political theory and
economics at the University of Copenhagen. He spent much of his life gathering and
editing old Icelandic manuscripts as a member and then as secretary of the Arnamagnaean
Foundation, which had been established for that purpose. Alone or with others he edited
such collections as Íslendinga sögur (vol. 1–2, 1843–47; “Icelandic Sagas”) and
Lovsamling for Island (1853–57; “Collection of Icelandic Laws”).
An advocate of Icelandic autonomy under Denmark, Sigurdsson took part in discussions
that led to the Danish king Christian IX’s restoration of the old Icelandic Althing
(parliament) as an advisory body in 1843. Sigurdsson was elected to that body for its first
session in 1845, later becoming its speaker. As a leader of the Patriotic Party, Sigurdsson
successfully agitated for Iceland’s freedom of trade (1854); he also led in the
modernization of Iceland’s agriculture and fishing techniques. Always pressing Denmark
for self-government, he undoubtedly influenced the granting by Denmark in 1874 of a
constitution that provided for Iceland’s control of its finances and for legislative power
shared with the Danish crown.

Józef Piłsudski
Józef Piłsudski
Józef Piłsudski, in full Józef Klemens Piłsudski,
(born December 5, 1867, Żułów, Poland, Russian
Empire [now in Lithuania]—died May 12, 1935,
Warsaw, Poland), Polish revolutionary and statesman,
the first chief of state (1918–22) of the newly
independent Poland established in November 1918.
After leading a coup d’état in 1926, he rejected an
offer of the presidency but remained politically influential while serving as minister of
defense until 1935.
Early life and political activities
Piłsudski was the second son of an impoverished Polish nobleman. His mother, née Maria
Billewicz, inspired him with hatred for the Russian imperial regime, which was treating the
Poles with great harshness after their insurrection of 1863. On leaving the secondary school
in Wilno (modern Vilnius), Piłsudski studied medicine at Kharkov in 1885 but was
suspended as politically suspect in 1886. Returning to Wilno, he consorted with young
socialists. Piłsudski was arrested in March 1887 on a false charge of plotting the
assassination of the tsar Alexander III and was banished to eastern Siberia for five years.
Piłsudski returned in 1892, determined to organize an insurrection and to work for the
reestablishment of Poland’s independence. He joined the newly founded Polish Socialist
Party (PPS), of which he soon became a leader. He started a clandestine newspaper,
Robotnik (“The Worker”), in Wilno. In July 1899 he married, in a Protestant church, the
beautiful Maria Juszkiewicz, the divorced wife of a Polish civil engineer, and moved to
Łódź, where he continued to edit and print his paper.
In February 1900 he was incarcerated by the Russians in the Warsaw citadel. He feigned
insanity so successfully that he was transferred to a military hospital in St. Petersburg, from
which he escaped in May 1901. He took refuge in Kraków in Austrian Poland, but in April
1902 he was back in Russian Poland looking after the party organization.
When the Russo-Japanese War broke out in February 1904, Piłsudski went to Tokyo to
solicit Japanese assistance for an insurrection in Poland. He had been preceded by Roman
Dmowski, his rival in the nationalist movement, who had told the Japanese that Piłsudski’s
plan was impracticable. The two Polish leaders agreed to disagree. Piłsudski returned

clandestinely to Russian Poland to help direct the revolutionary movement that was
spreading throughout the empire. After the Russian revolution was put down late in 1905, a
split occurred within the PPS: the left wing, which proposed to delete from the party’s
program the stipulation that its main aim was an independent Poland, broke with
Piłsudski’s group, which insisted on that stipulation.
Attempts to organize a Polish army
Aware of the Russian Empire’s structural weakness
and foreseeing a European war, Piłsudski concluded
that it was imperative to organize the nucleus of a
future Polish army. In 1908 he formed a secret Union
of Military Action—financed with a sum of money
stolen from a Russian mail train by an armed band led
by Piłsudski himself. In 1910, with the help of the
Austrian military authorities, he was able to convert his secret union into a legal Union of
Riflemen, actually a school for Polish officers. At a meeting of Polish sympathizers in Paris
in 1914, he declared that war was imminent and that
the problem of the independence of Poland will be definitely solved only if Russia is beaten by
Austria-Hungary and Germany, and Germany vanquished by France, Great Britain and the
United States; it is our duty to bring that about.
World War I justified Piłsudski’s prediction. Until 1916 the three brigades of the Polish
Legion, technically under Austro-Hungarian command, distinguished themselves against
the Russians. On November 5, 1916, Germany and Austria-Hungary, short of manpower,
proclaimed the independence of Poland, hoping that Polish divisions could be deployed on
the Eastern Front so that German divisions could be moved to the west. Piłsudski,
appointed head of the military department of the newly created Polish council of state,
accepted the idea of a Polish army on condition that it be part of a sovereign Polish state.
His position was unexpectedly reinforced by the Russian Revolution of March 1917. The
German government, however, refused to bind itself as to Poland’s future, demanding
instead that the existing Polish units should swear “fidelity in arms with the German and
Austrian forces.” Piłsudski, refusing to comply, was arrested in July 1917 and imprisoned
in Magdeburg.

Józef Piłsudski
Released after the German collapse in the west,
Piłsudski arrived in Warsaw on November 10, 1918,
as a national hero. Four days later he was
unanimously accepted as head of state and
commander in chief of the Polish army. From that
moment he ceased to be the man of a party, though
his main support came from the left and from the
centre; the right saw its leader in Dmowski, who had been heading the Polish National
Committee in Paris and was now appointed by Piłsudski to be Poland’s first delegate at the
peace conference, together with Ignacy Paderewski.
Piłsudski devoted himself to protecting Poland against the Russian Red Army, which was
trying to fight its way into Germany in order to consolidate the revolution there. He led the
Polish forces far to the east, occupying large areas that had belonged to Poland before the
18th-century partitions. He envisioned a federal state comprising Poles, Lithuanians, and
Ukrainians, whereas Dmowski argued that these areas should simply be incorporated
within a unitary Poland. In 1920 a counteroffensive by the Red Army forced the Poles to
retreat westward almost to the suburbs of Warsaw, but Piłsudski, made marshal of Poland
on March 19, conceived and directed a maneuver that in August brought victory to Poland.
After the adoption of a democratic constitution and a new general election, Piłsudski
transmitted his powers on December 14, 1922, to his friend Gabriel Narutowicz, the newly
elected president of the republic, who two days later was assassinated. Stanisław
Wojciechowski, another of Piłsudski’s old colleagues, was next elected president, the
marshal agreeing to serve as chief of the general staff. When a right-wing government
assumed power, Piłsudski resigned gradually from the functions he held and in 1923 went
into retirement at Sulejówek, near Warsaw, with his second wife, née Aleksandra
Szczerbińska, and his two daughters.
Piłsudski became disillusioned with the working of the parliamentary system. On May 12,
1926, during a time of political crisis and economic depression, he marched on Warsaw at
the head of a few regiments, causing the government, including President Wojciechowski,
to resign two days later. The parliament elected Piłsudski president of the republic on May
31, but he refused the honour, and another of his old friends, Ignacy Mościcki, was elected
instead. In the new government Piłsudski assumed the Ministry of Defense, which he held
until his death. During the ensuing years he was the major influence behind the scenes in
Poland, especially in the field of foreign policy.

Later years
With few exceptions, Piłsudski’s former socialist
friends abandoned him and joined a centre-left
coalition, which in the summer of 1930 started a mass
campaign to overthrow his “dictatorship.” Piłsudski’s
reaction was ruthless; to “cleanse” political life, he
had 18 party leaders arrested and imprisoned in the
fortress of Brześć. Though all of them were
subsequently released, and their political parties were not dissolved, the country was ruled
by Piłsudski’s men. The most prominent among them was Colonel Józef Beck, Piłsudski’s
former chef de cabinet, who became deputy foreign minister in December 1930 and foreign
minister in November 1932.
After Adolf Hitler came to power in Germany on January 30, 1933, Piłsudski was
compelled to accept Hitler’s suggestion of a 10-year German-Polish nonaggression
agreement (January 24, 1934). To show that Poland’s intentions were above suspicion,
Beck was sent to Moscow in February, and the existing Soviet-Polish nonaggression treaty
was prolonged to December 31, 1945. Later Hitler repeatedly suggested a German-Polish
alliance against the U.S.S.R., but Piłsudski took no notice of the proposal; he also declined
to meet with Hitler. Piłsudski sought to gain time, believing that Poland should be ready to
fight when the necessity arose. Such were the last instructions he gave to Beck. Shortly
afterward he died in Warsaw of cancer of the liver. He was buried in a crypt of the Wawel
Cathedral in Kraków, among Polish kings.
A romantic revolutionary, a great soldier without formal military training, a man of rare
audacity and willpower as well as great insight into European politics, Piłsudski was
nevertheless poorly equipped to rule a modern state. He left Poland undeveloped
economically and with an army that was ready to fight heroically but was doomed because
of its composition and inadequate armament.

After leading a coup d’état in 1926, he rejected an offer of the presidency but remained politically influential while serving as minister of defense until 1935. Early life and political activities Piłsudski was the second son of an impoverished Polish nobleman. His mother, née Maria Billewicz, inspired him with hatred for the Russian imperial regime, which was treating the Poles with great harshness after their insurrection of 1863. On leaving the secondary school in Wilno (modern Vilnius), Piłsudski studied medicine at Kharkov in 1885 but was suspended as politically suspect in 1886. Returning to Wilno, he consorted with young socialists. Piłsudski was arrested in March 1887 on a false charge of plotting the assassination of the tsar Alexander III and was banished to eastern Siberia for five years. Piłsudski returned in 1892, determined to organize an insurrection and to work for the reestablishment of Poland’s independence. He joined the newly founded Polish Socialist Party (PPS), of which he soon became a leader. He started a clandestine newspaper, Robotnik (“The Worker”), in Wilno. In July 1899 he married, in a Protestant church, the beautiful Maria Juszkiewicz, the divorced wife of a Polish civil engineer, and moved to Łódź, where he continued to edit and print his paper. In February 1900 he was incarcerated by the Russians in the Warsaw citadel. He feigned insanity so successfully that he was transferred to a military hospital in St. Petersburg, from which he escaped in May 1901. He took refuge in Kraków in Austrian Poland, but in April 1902 he was back in Russian Poland looking after the party organization. When the Russo-Japanese War broke out in February 1904, Piłsudski went to Tokyo to solicit Japanese assistance for an insurrection in Poland. He had been preceded by Roman Dmowski, his rival in the nationalist movement, who had told the Japanese that Piłsudski’s plan was impracticable. The two Polish leaders agreed to disagree. Piłsudski returned  Józef Piłsudski   Józef Piłsudski clandestinely to Russian Poland to help direct the revolutionary movement that was spreading throughout the empire. After the Russian revolution was put down late in 1905, a split occurred within the PPS: the left wing, which proposed to delete from the party’s program the stipulation that its main aim was an independent Poland, broke with Piłsudski’s group, which insisted on that stipulation. Attempts to organize a Polish army Aware of the Russian Empire’s structural weakness and foreseeing a European war, Piłsudski concluded that it was imperative to organize the nucleus of a future Polish army. In 1908 he formed a secret Union of Military Action—financed with a sum of money stolen from a Russian mail train by an armed band led by Piłsudski himself. In 1910, with the help of the Austrian military authorities, he was able to convert his secret union into a legal Union of Riflemen, actually a school for Polish officers. At a meeting of Polish sympathizers in Paris in 1914, he declared that war was imminent and that the problem of the independence of Poland will be definitely solved only if Russia is beaten by Austria-Hungary and Germany, and Germany vanquished by France, Great Britain and the United States; it is our duty to bring that about. World War I justified Piłsudski’s prediction. Until 1916 the three brigades of the Polish Legion, technically under Austro-Hungarian command, distinguished themselves against the Russians. On November 5, 1916, Germany and Austria-Hungary, short of manpower, proclaimed the independence of Poland, hoping that Polish divisions could be deployed on the Eastern Front so that German divisions could be moved to the west. Piłsudski, appointed head of the military department of the newly created Polish council of state, accepted the idea of a Polish army on condition that it be part of a sovereign Polish state. His position was unexpectedly reinforced by the Russian Revolution of March 1917. The German government, however, refused to bind itself as to Poland’s future, demanding instead that the existing Polish units should swear “fidelity in arms with the German and Austrian forces.” Piłsudski, refusing to comply, was arrested in July 1917 and imprisoned in Magdeburg. An independent Poland  Józef Piłsudski   Józef Piłsudski Released after the German collapse in the west, Piłsudski arrived in Warsaw on November 10, 1918, as a national hero. Four days later he was unanimously accepted as head of state and commander in chief of the Polish army. From that moment he ceased to be the man of a party, though his main support came from the left and from the centre; the right saw its leader in Dmowski, who had been heading the Polish National Committee in Paris and was now appointed by Piłsudski to be Poland’s first delegate at the peace conference, together with Ignacy Paderewski. Piłsudski devoted himself to protecting Poland against the Russian Red Army, which was trying to fight its way into Germany in order to consolidate the revolution there. He led the Polish forces far to the east, occupying large areas that had belonged to Poland before the 18th-century partitions. He envisioned a federal state comprising Poles, Lithuanians, and Ukrainians, whereas Dmowski argued that these areas should simply be incorporated within a unitary Poland. In 1920 a counteroffensive by the Red Army forced the Poles to retreat westward almost to the suburbs of Warsaw, but Piłsudski, made marshal of Poland on March 19, conceived and directed a maneuver that in August brought victory to Poland. After the adoption of a democratic constitution and a new general election, Piłsudski transmitted his powers on December 14, 1922, to his friend Gabriel Narutowicz, the newly elected president of the republic, who two days later was assassinated. Stanisław Wojciechowski, another of Piłsudski’s old colleagues, was next elected president, the marshal agreeing to serve as chief of the general staff. When a right-wing government assumed power, Piłsudski resigned gradually from the functions he held and in 1923 went into retirement at Sulejówek, near Warsaw, with his second wife, née Aleksandra Szczerbińska, and his two daughters. Piłsudski became disillusioned with the working of the parliamentary system. On May 12, 1926, during a time of political crisis and economic depression, he marched on Warsaw at the head of a few regiments, causing the government, including President Wojciechowski, to resign two days later. The parliament elected Piłsudski president of the republic on May 31, but he refused the honour, and another of his old friends, Ignacy Mościcki, was elected instead. In the new government Piłsudski assumed the Ministry of Defense, which he held until his death. During the ensuing years he was the major influence behind the scenes in Poland, especially in the field of foreign policy.

Though all of them were subsequently released, and their political parties were not dissolved, the country was ruled by Piłsudski’s men. The most prominent among them was Colonel Józef Beck, Piłsudski’s former chef de cabinet, who became deputy foreign minister in December 1930 and foreign minister in November 1932. After Adolf Hitler came to power in Germany on January 30, 1933, Piłsudski was compelled to accept Hitler’s suggestion of a 10-year German-Polish nonaggression agreement (January 24, 1934). To show that Poland’s intentions were above suspicion, Beck was sent to Moscow in February, and the existing Soviet-Polish nonaggression treaty was prolonged to December 31, 1945. Later Hitler repeatedly suggested a German-Polish alliance against the U.S.S.R., but Piłsudski took no notice of the proposal; he also declined to meet with Hitler. Piłsudski sought to gain time, believing that Poland should be ready to fight when the necessity arose. Such were the last instructions he gave to Beck. Shortly afterward he died in Warsaw of cancer of the liver. He was buried in a crypt of the Wawel Cathedral in Kraków, among Polish kings. A romantic revolutionary, a great soldier without formal military training, a man of rare audacity and willpower as well as great insight into European politics, Piłsudski was nevertheless poorly equipped to rule a modern state. He left Poland undeveloped economically and with an army that was ready to fight heroically but was doomed because of its composition and inadequate armament.

Kamehameha IV
Kamehameha IV, original name Alexander
Liholiho, (born Feb. 9, 1834, Ewa, Oahu, Hawaiian
Islands—died Nov. 30, 1863, Honolulu, Oahu),
Hawaiian sovereign known for his firm opposition to
the annexation of his kingdom by the United States.
As Kamehameha IV, he strove to curb the political
power of the American Protestant missionaries in the Hawaiian Islands. Dedicated to
protecting his people, who were rapidly dying out because of disease, he sponsored many
social and economic reforms. He established Hawaii’s commercial and political relations
with other nations on a solid base and tried to balance each country’s influence on island
life.
The son of Kekuanaoa, governor of Oahu, and Kinau, a woman chief who had been kuhina
nui (prime minister), Prince Alexander Liholiho was adopted as a child by his uncle,
Kamehameha III. He was rigorously educated by Protestant missionaries and attended the
Chiefs’ Childrens’ School. To prepare him further for his future role, Prince Alexander and
his brother, Lot, accompanied by the missionary-doctor Gerritt P. Judd, toured the United
States, England, and France in 1849. Crowned in 1855 at the death of Kamehameha III, he
became a popular monarch and was virtually an idol to the Hawaiian people.
The annexation movement of 1853–54, championed by many American missionaries,
caused Kamehameha to take steps to ensure the independence of his kingdom. In order to
balance foreign relations, which had formerly been dominated by the United States, he
invited the Church of England to establish itself in the islands. Impatient with the
puritanical American missionaries and suspicious of Yankee businessmen, he gradually
removed all American members from cabinet posts and encouraged Hawaii’s commercial
interests with other nations.
Among the many features of his benevolent rule were his construction of a sailors’ home
and the Queen’s Hospital in Honolulu in 1860 to provide free medical care for Hawaiians
and part-Hawaiians. He established Hawaii’s first chamber of commerce, took an active
interest in economic expansion, and sponsored an agricultural program designed to spur
native interest in farming. Island harbours were improved to accommodate Hawaii’s
rapidly growing whaling industry.

Karadjordje
Karadjordje, byname of George Petrović, Serbo-Croatian Karađorđe, or Ðorđe
Petrović, (born Nov. 3 [Nov. 14, New Style], 1762, Viševac, Serbia—died July 13 [July
25], 1817, Radovanje), leader of the Serbian people in their struggle for independence from
the Turks and founder of the Karadjordjević (Karađorđević) dynasty.
The son of a peasant, Karadjordje (“Black George”), so named because of his dark
complexion and penetrating eyes, in his youth herded swine and goats. In 1787 he migrated
to Austria, where he joined the army and served with distinction in Italy and against the
Turks. At the end of the Austro-Turkish war in 1791, Karadjordje made his home in Topola,
Serbia, and prospered by trading in livestock. Among his seven children was Alexander, a
future prince of Serbia (1842–58).
In the spring of 1804 the Serbs decided to rise against the tyrannical regime of the
Janissaries, the elite corps of the Turkish army, and elected Karadjordje their leader. The
Janissaries were swiftly defeated with the tacit approval of the sultan, Selim III, who
regarded them as rebels. His Serbian subjects, however, flushed by their successes, wanted
local autonomy. When Selim refused their demands, Karadjordje launched a war of
independence in 1805. A brilliant guerrilla fighter and a natural leader, he defeated the
Turks and liberated his country. When Russia went to war with Turkey (1807), the Serbs
had a powerful ally, but the Russians offered only a token force. Their failure to mention
Serbia in the truce of Slobozia with Turkey convinced Karadjordje that his nation was
regarded as a mere pawn in the turbulent politics of the Napoleonic era. When Russian
influence threatened to become paramount, the State Council gave Serbia its first
constitution and declared Karadjordje the “first and supreme Serbian hereditary leader”
(1808).
Serbo-Russian relations improved when Russia renewed the war with the Turks in 1809. A
Serbo-Russian army defeated the Turks at Varvarin and Loznica (1810). In 1812, however,
on the verge of Napoleon’s invasion, the Russians concluded a hasty treaty with the Turks
at Bucharest, leaving Serbia with little more than paper guarantees of autonomy. The
sultan, his powerful forces freed, invaded Serbia from three sides. Soon all opposition was
crushed (1813).
Sick with typhus and broken in spirit, Karadjordje fled to Austria. Serb autonomy was,
however, lost only temporarily, for in 1815 another national leader, Miloš Obrenović, arose

to direct a successful rebellion against the Turks. Karadjordje, who was regarded by Miloš
as an enemy, was not allowed to return to Serbia. After living for a time in Russia, where
he was well received, he secretly returned to Serbia hoping to organize an uprising against
the Turks in alliance with Greek patriots. Fearing the presence of such a dangerous rival,
Miloš had him murdered in his sleep. To ingratiate himself with the sultan, he sent the slain
man’s head to Constantinople. The assassination initiated a vendetta between the rival
dynasties descending from the two leaders that was to plague Serbian politics until the
assassination of King Alexander (Aleksandar Obrenović) in 1903.

The son of a peasant, Karadjordje (“Black George”), so named because of his dark complexion and penetrating eyes, in his youth herded swine and goats. In 1787 he migrated to Austria, where he joined the army and served with distinction in Italy and against the Turks. At the end of the Austro-Turkish war in 1791, Karadjordje made his home in Topola, Serbia, and prospered by trading in livestock. Among his seven children was Alexander, a future prince of Serbia (1842–58). In the spring of 1804 the Serbs decided to rise against the tyrannical regime of the Janissaries, the elite corps of the Turkish army, and elected Karadjordje their leader. The Janissaries were swiftly defeated with the tacit approval of the sultan, Selim III, who regarded them as rebels. His Serbian subjects, however, flushed by their successes, wanted local autonomy. When Selim refused their demands, Karadjordje launched a war of independence in 1805. A brilliant guerrilla fighter and a natural leader, he defeated the Turks and liberated his country. When Russia went to war with Turkey (1807), the Serbs had a powerful ally, but the Russians offered only a token force. Their failure to mention Serbia in the truce of Slobozia with Turkey convinced Karadjordje that his nation was regarded as a mere pawn in the turbulent politics of the Napoleonic era. When Russian influence threatened to become paramount, the State Council gave Serbia its first constitution and declared Karadjordje the “first and supreme Serbian hereditary leader” (1808). Serbo-Russian relations improved when Russia renewed the war with the Turks in 1809. A Serbo-Russian army defeated the Turks at Varvarin and Loznica (1810). In 1812, however, on the verge of Napoleon’s invasion, the Russians concluded a hasty treaty with the Turks at Bucharest, leaving Serbia with little more than paper guarantees of autonomy. The sultan, his powerful forces freed, invaded Serbia from three sides. Soon all opposition was crushed (1813). Sick with typhus and broken in spirit, Karadjordje fled to Austria. Serb autonomy was, however, lost only temporarily, for in 1815 another national leader, Miloš Obrenović, arose  Karadjordje   to direct a successful rebellion against the Turks. Karadjordje, who was regarded by Miloš as an enemy, was not allowed to return to Serbia. After living for a time in Russia, where he was well received, he secretly returned to Serbia hoping to organize an uprising against the Turks in alliance with Greek patriots. Fearing the presence of such a dangerous rival, Miloš had him murdered in his sleep. To ingratiate himself with the sultan, he sent the slain man’s head to Constantinople. The assassination initiated a vendetta between the rival dynasties descending from the two leaders that was to plague Serbian politics until the assassination of King Alexander (Aleksandar Obrenović) in 1903.

Katay Don Sasorith, byname William Rabbit, (born July 12, 1904—died Dec. 29, 1959,
Vientiane, Laos), Lao nationalist and author of eloquent resistance pamphlets in his youth,
who later held many government posts, among them that of premier in 1954–56.
Katay’s 33 years of government service began with a civil service post in the French
administration of Laos from 1926 to 1945. Of part Vietnamese descent, he was the chief
spokesman of the national resistance movement during World War II, joining with others to
form the Lao Issara, or Free Laos, movement, which fought first against the Japanese and
then against the French, who tried to reoccupy Laos after the fall of the Tojo government in
Japan in 1945. A provisional government was formed, and Katay was named minister of
finance; but its triumph was short-lived, and in 1946 he was forced to flee to Thailand,
where the government maintained itself in exile. He published a newspaper in which he
exhorted the overthrow of the French, and he wrote Contribution à l’histoire du mouvement
d’indépendance national Lao (1948; “Contribution to the History of the Lao National
Independence Movement”), under his pen name, William Rabbit, adapted from his own
name, Katay, which means “rabbit” in Lao.
In 1949 Katay returned to Vientiane and in 1951 he won election to the National Assembly.
From then on his rise to power was rapid; when Laos finally achieved independence from
France in 1954, Katay was named premier. Always suspicious of the Pathet Lao, the
Communist-dominated but overwhelmingly nationalist military organization, he was able
to secure U.S. financial support to combat what he termed “foreign Communist
aggression.” Claiming that the Viet Minh (North Vietnamese Communist forces) were
invading Laos through the Pathet Lao, Katay was able to obtain aid from the U.S.
government to resist them. In 1955 Katay lost parliamentary support and was forced to give
Prince Souvanna Phouma the premiership. The Prince continued an intricate balancing act
in domestic politics; both he and the government of Phoui Sananikone came under attack
by Katay whenever they proposed compromises with the Pathet Lao.

Kemal Atatürk
Kemal Atatürk
Kemal Atatürk, (Turkish: “Kemal, Father of Turks”)
original name Mustafa Kemal, also called Mustafa
Kemal Paşa, (born 1881, Salonika [now
Thessaloníki], Greece—died November 10, 1938,
Istanbul, Turkey), soldier, statesman, and reformer
who was the founder and first president (1923–38) of
the Republic of Turkey. He modernized the country’s
legal and educational systems and encouraged the adoption of a European way of life, with
Turkish written in the Latin alphabet and with citizens adopting European-style names.
One of the great figures of the 20th century, Atatürk rescued the surviving Turkish remnant
of the defeated Ottoman Empire at the end of World War I. He galvanized his people
against invading Greek forces who sought to impose the Allied will upon the war-weary
Turks and repulsed aggression by British, French, and Italian troops. Through these
struggles, he founded the modern Republic of Turkey, for which he is still revered by the
Turks. He succeeded in restoring to his people pride in their Turkishness, coupled with a
new sense of accomplishment as their nation was brought into the modern world. Over the
next two decades, Atatürk created a modern state that would grow under his successors into
a viable democracy. (For a more complete discussion of this period in Turkish history, see
Turkey, history of: The emergence of the modern Turkish state.)
Early life and education
Atatürk was born in 1881 in Salonika, then a thriving port of the Ottoman Empire, and was
given the name Mustafa. His father, Ali Riza, had been a lieutenant in a local militia unit
during the Russo-Turkish War of 1877–78, indicating that his origins were within the
Ottoman ruling class, if only marginally. Mustafa’s mother, Zübeyde Hanım, came from a
farming community west of Salonika.
Ali Riza died when Mustafa was seven years old, but he nevertheless had a significant
influence on the development of his son’s personality. At Mustafa’s birth, Ali Riza hung his
sword over his son’s cradle, dedicating him to military service. Most important, Ali Riza
saw to it that his son’s earliest education was carried out in a modern secular school, rather
than in the religious school Zübeyde Hanım would have preferred. In this way Ali Riza set

Kemal Atatürk -- Britannica Online Encyclopedia
https://www.britannica.com/print/article/40411
2/11
his son on the path of modernization. This was something for which Mustafa always felt
indebted to his father.
After Ali Riza’s death, Zübeyde Hanım moved to her step-brother’s farm outside Salonika.
Concerned that Mustafa might grow up uneducated, she sent him back to Salonika, where
he enrolled in a secular school that would have prepared him for a bureaucratic career.
Mustafa became enamoured of the uniforms worn by the military cadets in his
neighbourhood. He determined to enter upon a military career. Against his mother’s wishes,
Mustafa took the examination for entrance to the military secondary school.
At the secondary school, Mustafa received the nickname of Kemal, meaning “The Perfect
One,” from his mathematics teacher; he was thereafter known as Mustafa Kemal. In 1895
he progressed to the military school in Monastir (now Bitola, North Macedonia). He made
several new friends, including Ali Fethi (Okyar), who would later join him in the creation
and development of the Turkish republic.
Having completed his education at Monastir, Mustafa Kemal entered the War College in
Istanbul in March 1899. He enjoyed the freedom and sophistication of the city, to which he
was introduced by his new friend and classmate Ali Fuat (Cebesoy).
There was a good deal of political dissent in the air at the War College, directed against the
despotism of Sultan Abdülhamid II. Mustafa Kemal remained aloof from it until his third
year, when he became involved in the production of a clandestine newspaper. His activities
were uncovered, but he was allowed to complete the course, graduating as a second
lieutenant in 1902 and ranking in the top 10 of his class of more than 450 students. He then
entered the General Staff College, graduating in 1905 as a captain and ranking fifth out of a
class of 57; he was one of the empire’s leading young officers.
Military career
Mustafa Kemal’s career almost ended soon after his graduation when it was discovered that
he and several friends were meeting to read about and discuss political abuses within the
empire. A government spy infiltrated their group and informed on them. A cloud of
suspicion hung over their heads that was not to be lifted for years. The group was broken
up and its members assigned to remote areas of the empire. Mustafa Kemal and Ali Faut
were sent to the Fifth Army in Damascus, where Mustafa Kemal was angered by the way
corrupt officials were treating the local people. Becoming involved again in
antigovernment activities, he helped found a short-lived secret group called the Society for
Fatherland and Freedom.

Nevertheless, in September 1907 Mustafa Kemal was declared loyal and reassigned to
Salonika, which was awash with subversive activity. He joined the dominant
antigovernment group, the Committee of Union and Progress (CUP), which had ties to the
nationalist and reformist Young Turk movement.
In July 1908 an insurrection broke out in Macedonia. The sultan was forced to reinstate the
constitution of 1876, which limited his powers and reestablished a representative
government. The hero of this “Young Turk Revolution” was Enver (Enver Paşa), who later
became Mustafa Kemal’s greatest rival; the two men came to dislike each other thoroughly.
In 1909 two elements within the revolutionary movement came to the fore. One group
favoured decentralization, with harmony and cooperation between the Muslims and the
non-Muslims. The other, headed by the CUP, advocated centralization and Turkish control.
An insurrection spearheaded by reactionary troops broke out on the night of April 12–13,
1909. The revolution that had restored the constitution in 1908 was in danger. Military
officers and troops from Salonika, among whom Enver played a leading role, marched on
Istanbul. They arrived at the capital on April 23, and by the next day they had the situation
well in hand. The CUP took control and forced Abdülhamid II to abdicate.
Enver was thus in the ascendancy. Mustafa Kemal felt that the military, having gained its
political ends, should refrain from interfering in politics. He urged those officers who
wanted political careers to resign their commissions. This served only to increase the
hostility of Enver and other CUP leaders toward him. Mustafa Kemal turned his attention
from politics to military matters. He translated German infantry training manuals into
Turkish. From his staff position he criticized the state of the army’s training. His reputation
among serious military officers was growing. This activity also brought him into contact
with many of the rising young officers. A feeling of mutual respect developed between
Mustafa Kemal and some of these officers, who were later to flock to his support in the
creation of the Turkish nation.
The CUP, however, was fed up with him, and he was transferred to field command and then
sent to observe French army maneuvers in Picardy. Although consistently denied
promotion, Mustafa Kemal did not lose faith in himself. In late 1911 the Italians attacked
Libya, then an Ottoman province, and Mustafa Kemal went there immediately to fight.
Malaria and trouble with his eyes required him to leave the front for treatment in Vienna.
In October 1912, while Mustafa Kemal was in Vienna, the First Balkan War broke out. He
was assigned to the defense of the Gallipoli Peninsula, an area of strategic importance with
1/15/23, 3:41 PM

https://www.britannica.com/print/article/40411

respect to the Dardanelles. Within two months the Ottoman Empire lost most of its territory
in Europe, including Monastir and Salonika, places for which Mustafa Kemal had special
affection. Among the refugees who poured into Istanbul were his mother, sister, and
stepfather.
The Second Balkan War, of short duration (June–July 1913), saw the Ottomans regain part
of their lost territory. Relations were renewed with Bulgaria. Mustafa Kemal’s former
schoolmate Ali Fethi was named ambassador, and Mustafa Kemal accompanied him to
Sofia as military attaché. There he was promoted to lieutenant colonel.
Mustafa Kemal complained of Enver’s close ties to Germany and predicted German defeat
in an international conflict. Once World War I broke out, however, and the Ottoman Empire
entered on the side of the Central Powers, he sought a military command. Enver made him
cool his heels in Sofia but finally gave him command of the 19th Division, which was
being organized in the Gallipoli Peninsula. It was here that the Allies attempted their ill-
fated landings, giving Mustafa Kemal the opportunity to throw them back and thwart their
attempt to force the Dardanelles (February 1915–January 1916). During the battle, Mustafa
Kemal was hit by a piece of shrapnel, which lodged in the watch he carried in his breast
pocket and thus failed to cause him serious injury. His success at Gallipoli thrust Mustafa
Kemal onto the world scene. He was hailed as the “Saviour of Istanbul” and was promoted
to colonel on June 1, 1915.
In 1916 Mustafa Kemal was assigned to the Russian front and promoted to general,
acquiring the title of pasha. He was the only Turkish general to win any victories over the
Russians on the Eastern Front. Later that year, he took over the command of the Second
Army in southeastern Anatolia. There he met Colonel İsmet (İnönü), who would become
his closest ally in building the Turkish republic.
The outbreak of the Russian Revolution in March 1917 made Mustafa Kemal available for
service in the Ottoman provinces of Syria and Iraq, on which the British were advancing
from their base in Egypt. He was appointed to the command of the Seventh Army in Syria,
but he was appalled by the sad state of the army. Resigning his post, he returned without
permission to Istanbul. He was placed on leave for three months and then assigned to
accompany Crown Prince Mehmed Vahideddin on a state visit to Germany.
On his return to Istanbul, Mustafa Kemal fell ill with kidney problems, most probably
related to gonorrhea, which it is believed he had contracted earlier. (His physical problems
would later require him to have a personal physician in constant attendance throughout his
1/15/23, 3:41 PM

years as president of the Turkish republic.) He went to Vienna for treatment and then to
Carlsbad to recuperate. While he was in Carlsbad, Sultan Mehmed V died, and Vahideddin
assumed the throne as Mehmed VI. Mustafa Kemal was recalled to Istanbul in June 1918.
Through Enver’s machinations, the sultan assigned Mustafa Kemal to command the
collapsing Ottoman forces in Syria. He found the situation there worse than he had
imagined and withdrew northward to save the lives of as many of his soldiers as possible.
Fighting was halted by the Armistice of Mudros (October 30, 1918). Shortly afterward,
Enver and other leaders of the CUP fled to Germany, leaving the sultan to lead the
government. To ensure the continuation of his rule, Mehmed VI was willing to cooperate
with the Allies, who assumed control of the government.
The nationalist movement and the war for independence
The Allies did not wait for a peace treaty to begin claiming Ottoman territory. Early in
December 1918, Allied troops occupied sections of Istanbul and set up an Allied military
administration. On February 8, 1919, the French general Franchet d’Espèrey entered the
city in a spectacle compared to the entrance of Mehmed the Conqueror in 1453—but this
time signifying that Ottoman sovereignty over the imperial city was over. The Allies made
plans to incorporate the provinces of eastern Anatolia into an independent Armenian state.
French troops advanced into Cilicia in the southeast. Greece and Italy put forward
competing claims for southwestern Anatolia. The Italians occupied Marmaris, Antalya, and
Burdur, and on May 15, 1919, Greek troops landed at Izmir and began a drive into the
interior of Anatolia, killing Turkish inhabitants and ravaging the countryside. Allied
statesmen seemed to be abandoning Woodrow Wilson’s Fourteen Points in favour of the
old imperialist views set down in the secret treaties and contained in their own secret
ambitions.
Meanwhile, Mustafa Kemal’s armies had been disbanded. He returned to Istanbul on
November 13, 1919, just as ships of the Allied fleet sailed up the Bosporus. This scene, as
well as the city’s occupation by British, French, and Italian troops, left a lasting impression
on Mustafa Kemal. He was determined to oust them. He began meeting with selected
friends to formulate a policy to save Turkey. Among these friends were Ali Fuat and Rauf
(Orbay), the Ottoman naval hero. Ali Fuat was stationed in Anatolia and knew the situation
there intimately. He and Mustafa Kemal developed a plan for an Anatolian national

In various parts of Anatolia, Turks had already taken matters into their own hands, calling
themselves associations for the defense of rights and organizing paramilitary units. They
began to come into armed conflict with local non-Muslims, and it appeared that they might
soon do so against the occupying forces as well.
Fearing anarchy, the Allies urged the sultan to restore order in Anatolia. The grand vizier
recommended Mustafa Kemal as a loyal officer who could be sent to Anatolia as inspector
general of the Third Army. Mustafa Kemal contrived to get his orders written in such a way
as to give him extraordinarily extensive powers. These included the authority to issue
orders throughout Anatolia and to command obedience from provincial governors.
Modern Turkish history may be said to begin on the morning of May 19, 1919, with
Mustafa Kemal’s landing at Samsun, on the Black Sea coast of Anatolia. So
psychologically meaningful was this date for Mustafa Kemal that, when in later life he was
asked to provide his date of birth for an encyclopaedia article, he gave it as May 19, 1919.
Abandoning his official reason for being in Anatolia—to restore order—he headed inland
for Amasya. There he told a cheering crowd that the sultan was the prisoner of the Allies
and that he had come to prevent the nation from slipping through the fingers of its people.
This became his message to the Turks of Anatolia.
The Allies pressured the sultan to recall Mustafa Kemal, who ignored all communications
from Istanbul. The sultan dismissed him and telegraphed all provincial governors,
instructing them to ignore Mustafa Kemal’s orders. Imperial orders for his arrest were
circulated.
Mustafa Kemal avoided dismissal from the army by officially resigning late on the evening
of July 7. As a civilian, he pressed on with his retinue from Sivas to Erzurum, where
General Kâzim Karabekir, commander of the XV Army Corps of 18,000 men, was
headquartered. At this critical moment, when Mustafa Kemal had no military support or
official status, Kâzim threw in his lot with Mustafa Kemal, placing his troops at Mustafa
Kemal’s disposal. This was a crucial turning point in the struggle for independence.
Kâzim had called for a congress of all defense-of-rights associations to be held in Erzurum
on July 23, 1919. Mustafa Kemal was elected head of the Erzurum Congress and thereby
gained an official status. The congress drafted a document covering the six eastern
provinces of the empire. Later known as the National Pact, it affirmed the inviolability of
the Ottoman “frontiers”—that is, all the Ottoman lands inhabited by Turks when the
Armistice of Mudros was signed. It also created a provisional government, revoked the

special status arrangements for the minorities of the Ottoman Empire (the capitulations),
and set up a steering committee, which then elected Mustafa Kemal as head.
Mustafa Kemal sought to extend the National Pact to the entire Ottoman-Muslim
population of the empire. To that end, he called a national congress that met in Sivas and
ratified the pact. He exposed attempts by the sultan’s government to arrest him and to
disrupt the Sivas Congress. The grand vizier in Istanbul was driven from office. The new
government, which was sympathetic to the nationalist movement, restored Mustafa
Kemal’s military rank and decorations.
Unconvinced of the sultan’s ability to rid the country of the Allied occupation, Mustafa
Kemal established the seat of his provisional government in Ankara, 300 miles (480 km)
from Istanbul. There he would be safer from both the sultan and the Allies. This proved a
wise decision. On March 16, 1920, in Istanbul, the Allies arrested leading nationalist
sympathizers, including Rauf, and sent them to Malta.
The conciliatory Istanbul government fell and was replaced by reactionaries who dissolved
the parliament and pressured the religious dignitaries into declaring Mustafa Kemal and his
associates infidels worthy of being shot on sight. The die was cast—it would be the sultan’s
government or Mustafa Kemal’s.
Many prominent Turks escaped from Istanbul to Ankara, including İsmet and, after him,
Fevzi (Çakmak), the sultan’s war minister. Fevzi became Mustafa Kemal’s chief of the
general staff. New elections were held, and a parliament, called the Grand National
Assembly (GNA), met in Ankara on April 23, 1920. The assembly elected Mustafa Kemal
as its president.
In June 1920 the Allies handed the sultan the Treaty of Sèvres, which he signed on August
10, 1920. By the provisions of this treaty, the Ottoman state was greatly reduced in size,
with Greece one of the major beneficiaries. Armenia was declared independent. Mustafa
Kemal repudiated the treaty. Having received military aid from the Soviet Union, he set out
to drive the Greeks from Anatolia and Thrace and to subdue the new Armenian state.
As the war against the Greeks started to go well for Mustafa Kemal’s forces, France and
Italy negotiated with the nationalist government in Ankara. They withdrew their troops
from Anatolia. This left the Armenians in southeastern Anatolia without the protection of
the French troops. With the French and Italians out of the picture, Kâzim then moved
against the Armenian state. He was assisted by the Bolsheviks, who had established

relations with the government of the GNA. Deserting their Armenian protégés, the
Russians supplied the nationalists with weapons and ammunition and joined the assault on
the Armenian Socialist Republic, which had been their own creation. This combined attack
was too much for the Armenians, who were crushed in October and November 1920; they
surrendered early in November. By the Treaty of Alexandropol (December 3, 1920) and the
Treaty of Moscow (March 16, 1921), the nationalists regained the eastern provinces, as
well as the cities of Kars and Ardahan, and the Soviet Union became the first nation to
recognize the nationalist government in Ankara. Turkey’s eastern borders were fixed at the
Arpa and Aras rivers.
The Greeks were more difficult to overcome, as they continued the advance toward Ankara
which had begun in June 1920. By the end of July they had taken Bursa and were pushing
on toward Ankara. Ali Fuat was relieved as commander on this front and replaced by İsmet.
The Turkish army stood its ground at the İnönü River, north of Kütahya. They threw the
Greeks back on January 10, 1921, at the First Battle of the İnönü.
The Greeks did not resume their offensive until March 1921. İsmet again met them at the
İnönü River, in a battle that raged from March 27 to April 1. On the evening of April 6–7,
1921, the Greeks broke off the engagement and retreated. In 1934, when the Turks were
required by law to take last names, İsmet assumed the surname İnönü in memory of these
important victories.
Undaunted, the Greeks launched another offensive on July 13, 1921. İsmet fell back to the
Sakarya River, so close to Ankara that the artillery fire could be heard there. Opposition to
Mustafa Kemal developed in the GNA, led by Kâzim, who had grown jealous. The
opposition demanded that Mustafa Kemal’s powers be curtailed so that a new policy could
be developed. In addition they sought to have Mustafa Kemal assume personal direction of
the war against the Greeks, anticipating a Greek victory that would result in the destruction
of Mustafa Kemal’s stature and charisma. On August 4, Mustafa Kemal agreed, on the
condition, which was accepted, that he be granted all the powers assigned to the GNA. He
then assumed the role of commander in chief with total authority. He defeated the Greeks at
the Battle of the Sakarya (August 23–September 13, 1921) and initiated an offensive
(August 26–September 9, 1922) that pushed the Greeks to the sea at Izmir.
With Anatolia rid of most of the Allies, the GNA, at the behest of Mustafa Kemal, voted on
November 1, 1922, to abolish the sultanate. This was soon followed by the flight into exile
of Sultan Mehmed VI on November 17. The Allies then invited the Ankara government to

discussions that resulted in the signing of the Treaty of Lausanne on July 24, 1923. This
treaty fixed the European border of Turkey at the Maritsa River in eastern Thrace.
The nationalists occupied Istanbul on October 2. Ankara was named the capital, and on
October 29 the Turkish republic was proclaimed. Turkey was now in complete control of
its territory and sovereignty.
The Turkish republic
Mustafa Kemal then embarked upon the reform of his country, his goal being to bring it
into the 20th century. His instrument was the Republican People’s Party, formed on August
9, 1923, to replace the defense-of-rights associations. His program was embodied in the
party’s “Six Arrows”: republicanism, nationalism, populism, statism (state-owned and
state-operated industrialization aimed at making Turkey self-sufficient as a 20th-century
industrialized state), secularism, and revolution. The guiding principle was the existence of
a permanent state of revolution, meaning continuing change in the state and society.
The caliphate was abolished on March 3, 1924 (since the early 16th century, the Ottoman
sultans had laid claim to the title of caliph of the Muslims); the religious schools were
dismantled at the same time. Abolition of the religious courts followed on April 8. In 1925,
wearing the fez was prohibited—thereafter Turks wore Western-style headdress. Mustafa
Kemal went on a speaking tour of Anatolia during which he wore a European-style hat,
setting an example for the Turkish people. In Istanbul and elsewhere there was a run on
materials for making hats. In the same year, the religious brotherhoods, strongholds of
conservatism, were outlawed.
The emancipation of women was encouraged by Mustafa Kemal’s marriage in 1923 to a
Western-educated woman, Latife Hanım (they were divorced in 1925), and was set in
motion by a number of laws. In December 1934, women were given the vote for
parliamentary members and were made eligible to hold parliamentary seats.
Almost overnight the whole system of Islamic law was discarded. From February to June
1926 the Swiss civil code, the Italian penal code, and the German commercial code were
adopted wholesale. As a result, women’s emancipation was strengthened by the abolition of
polygamy, marriage was made a civil contract, and divorce was recognized as a civil
action.
A reform of truly revolutionary proportions was the replacement of the Arabic script—in
which the Ottoman Turkish language had been written for centuries—by the Latin

alphabet. This took place officially in November 1928, setting Turkey on the path to
achieving one of the highest literacy rates in the Middle East. Once again Mustafa Kemal
went into the countryside, and with chalk and a blackboard he demonstrated the new
alphabet to the Turkish people and explained how the letters should be pronounced.
Education benefited from this reform, as the youth of Turkey, cut off from the past with its
emphasis on religion, were encouraged to take advantage of new educational opportunities
that gave access to the Western scientific and humanistic traditions.
Another important step was the adoption of surnames or family names, which was decreed
by the GNA in 1934. The assembly gave Mustafa Kemal the name Atatürk (“Father of the
Turks”).
After having settled Turkey firmly within its national borders and set it on the path of
modernization, Atatürk sought to develop his country’s foreign policy in similar fashion.
First and foremost, he decided that Turkey would not pursue any irredentist claims except
for the eventual incorporation of the Alexandretta region, which he felt was included within
the boundaries set by the National Pact. He settled matters with Great Britain in a treaty
signed on June 5, 1926. It called for Turkey to renounce its claims to Mosul in return for a
10 percent interest in the oil produced there. Atatürk also sought reconciliation with
Greece; this was achieved through a treaty of friendship signed on December 30, 1930.
Minority populations were exchanged on both sides, borders were set, and military
problems such as naval equality in the eastern Mediterranean were ironed out.
This ambitious program of forced modernization was not accomplished without strain and
bloodshed. In February 1925 the Kurds of southwestern Anatolia raised the banner of revolt
in the name of Islam. It took two months to put the revolt down; its leader Şeyh Said was
then hanged. In June 1926 a plot by several disgruntled politicians to assassinate Atatürk
was discovered, and the 13 ringleaders were tried and hanged.
There were other trials and executions, but under Atatürk the country was steadfastly
steered toward becoming a modern state with a minimum of repression. There was a high
degree of consensus among the ruling elite about the goals of the society. As many of those
goals were achieved, however, many Turks wished to see a more democratic regime.
Atatürk even experimented in 1930 with the creation of an opposition party led by his
longtime associate Ali Fethi, but its immediate and overwhelming success caused Atatürk
to squash it.

Atatürk Mausoleum
In his later years Atatürk grew more remote from the
Turkish people. He had the Dolmabahçe Palace in
Istanbul, formerly a main residence of the sultans,
refurbished and spent more time there. Always a
heavy drinker who ate little, he began to decline in
health. His illness, cirrhosis of the liver, was not
diagnosed until too late. He bore the pain of the last
few months of his life with great character and dignity, and on November 10, 1938, he died
at 9:05 AM in Dolmabahçe. His state funeral was an occasion for enormous outpourings of
grief from the Turkish people. His body was transported through Istanbul and from there to
Ankara, where it awaited a suitable final resting place. This was constructed years later: a
mausoleum in Ankara contains Atatürk’s sarcophagus and a museum devoted to his
memory.
Atatürk is omnipresent in Turkey. His portrait is in every home and place of business and
on the postage and bank notes. His words are chiseled on important buildings. Statues of
him abound. Turkish politicians, regardless of party affiliation, claim to be the inheritors of
Atatürk’s mantle, but none has matched his breadth of vision, dedication, and selflessness.

Kemal Paşa, (born 1881, Salonika [now Thessaloníki], Greece—died November 10, 1938, Istanbul, Turkey), soldier, statesman, and reformer who was the founder and first president (1923–38) of the Republic of Turkey. He modernized the country’s legal and educational systems and encouraged the adoption of a European way of life, with Turkish written in the Latin alphabet and with citizens adopting European-style names. One of the great figures of the 20th century, Atatürk rescued the surviving Turkish remnant of the defeated Ottoman Empire at the end of World War I. He galvanized his people against invading Greek forces who sought to impose the Allied will upon the war-weary Turks and repulsed aggression by British, French, and Italian troops. Through these struggles, he founded the modern Republic of Turkey, for which he is still revered by the Turks. He succeeded in restoring to his people pride in their Turkishness, coupled with a new sense of accomplishment as their nation was brought into the modern world. Over the next two decades, Atatürk created a modern state that would grow under his successors into a viable democracy. (For a more complete discussion of this period in Turkish history, see Turkey, history of: The emergence of the modern Turkish state.) Early life and education Atatürk was born in 1881 in Salonika, then a thriving port of the Ottoman Empire, and was given the name Mustafa. His father, Ali Riza, had been a lieutenant in a local militia unit during the Russo-Turkish War of 1877–78, indicating that his origins were within the Ottoman ruling class, if only marginally. Mustafa’s mother, Zübeyde Hanım, came from a farming community west of Salonika. Ali Riza died when Mustafa was seven years old, but he nevertheless had a significant influence on the development of his son’s personality. At Mustafa’s birth, Ali Riza hung his sword over his son’s cradle, dedicating him to military service. Most important, Ali Riza saw to it that his son’s earliest education was carried out in a modern secular school, rather than in the religious school Zübeyde Hanım would have preferred. In this way Ali Riza set  Kemal Atatürk   his son on the path of modernization. This was something for which Mustafa always felt indebted to his father. After Ali Riza’s death, Zübeyde Hanım moved to her step-brother’s farm outside Salonika. Concerned that Mustafa might grow up uneducated, she sent him back to Salonika, where he enrolled in a secular school that would have prepared him for a bureaucratic career. Mustafa became enamoured of the uniforms worn by the military cadets in his neighbourhood. He determined to enter upon a military career. Against his mother’s wishes, Mustafa took the examination for entrance to the military secondary school. At the secondary school, Mustafa received the nickname of Kemal, meaning “The Perfect One,” from his mathematics teacher; he was thereafter known as Mustafa Kemal. In 1895 he progressed to the military school in Monastir (now Bitola, North Macedonia). He made several new friends, including Ali Fethi (Okyar), who would later join him in the creation and development of the Turkish republic. Having completed his education at Monastir, Mustafa Kemal entered the War College in Istanbul in March 1899. He enjoyed the freedom and sophistication of the city, to which he was introduced by his new friend and classmate Ali Fuat (Cebesoy). There was a good deal of political dissent in the air at the War College, directed against the despotism of Sultan Abdülhamid II. Mustafa Kemal remained aloof from it until his third year, when he became involved in the production of a clandestine newspaper. His activities were uncovered, but he was allowed to complete the course, graduating as a second lieutenant in 1902 and ranking in the top 10 of his class of more than 450 students. He then entered the General Staff College, graduating in 1905 as a captain and ranking fifth out of a class of 57; he was one of the empire’s leading young officers. Military career Mustafa Kemal’s career almost ended soon after his graduation when it was discovered that he and several friends were meeting to read about and discuss political abuses within the empire. A government spy infiltrated their group and informed on them. A cloud of suspicion hung over their heads that was not to be lifted for years. The group was broken up and its members assigned to remote areas of the empire. Mustafa Kemal and Ali Faut were sent to the Fifth Army in Damascus, where Mustafa Kemal was angered by the way corrupt officials were treating the local people. Becoming involved again in antigovernment activities, he helped found a short-lived secret group called the Society for Fatherland and Freedom. Kemal Atatürk   Nevertheless, in September 1907 Mustafa Kemal was declared loyal and reassigned to Salonika, which was awash with subversive activity. He joined the dominant antigovernment group, the Committee of Union and Progress (CUP), which had ties to the nationalist and reformist Young Turk movement. In July 1908 an insurrection broke out in Macedonia. The sultan was forced to reinstate the constitution of 1876, which limited his powers and reestablished a representative government. The hero of this “Young Turk Revolution” was Enver (Enver Paşa), who later became Mustafa Kemal’s greatest rival; the two men came to dislike each other thoroughly. In 1909 two elements within the revolutionary movement came to the fore. One group favoured decentralization, with harmony and cooperation between the Muslims and the non-Muslims. The other, headed by the CUP, advocated centralization and Turkish control. An insurrection spearheaded by reactionary troops broke out on the night of April 12–13, 1909. The revolution that had restored the constitution in 1908 was in danger. Military officers and troops from Salonika, among whom Enver played a leading role, marched on Istanbul. They arrived at the capital on April 23, and by the next day they had the situation well in hand. The CUP took control and forced Abdülhamid II to abdicate. Enver was thus in the ascendancy. Mustafa Kemal felt that the military, having gained its political ends, should refrain from interfering in politics. He urged those officers who wanted political careers to resign their commissions. This served only to increase the hostility of Enver and other CUP leaders toward him. Mustafa Kemal turned his attention from politics to military matters. He translated German infantry training manuals into Turkish. From his staff position he criticized the state of the army’s training. His reputation among serious military officers was growing. This activity also brought him into contact with many of the rising young officers. A feeling of mutual respect developed between Mustafa Kemal and some of these officers, who were later to flock to his support in the creation of the Turkish nation. The CUP, however, was fed up with him, and he was transferred to field command and then sent to observe French army maneuvers in Picardy. Although consistently denied promotion, Mustafa Kemal did not lose faith in himself. In late 1911 the Italians attacked Libya, then an Ottoman province, and Mustafa Kemal went there immediately to fight. Malaria and trouble with his eyes required him to leave the front for treatment in Vienna. In October 1912, while Mustafa Kemal was in Vienna, the First Balkan War broke out. He was assigned to the defense of the Gallipoli Peninsula, an area of strategic importance with  Kemal Atatürk   respect to the Dardanelles. Within two months the Ottoman Empire lost most of its territory in Europe, including Monastir and Salonika, places for which Mustafa Kemal had special affection. Among the refugees who poured into Istanbul were his mother, sister, and stepfather. The Second Balkan War, of short duration (June–July 1913), saw the Ottomans regain part of their lost territory. Relations were renewed with Bulgaria. Mustafa Kemal’s former schoolmate Ali Fethi was named ambassador, and Mustafa Kemal accompanied him to Sofia as military attaché. There he was promoted to lieutenant colonel. Mustafa Kemal complained of Enver’s close ties to Germany and predicted German defeat in an international conflict. Once World War I broke out, however, and the Ottoman Empire entered on the side of the Central Powers, he sought a military command. Enver made him cool his heels in Sofia but finally gave him command of the 19th Division, which was being organized in the Gallipoli Peninsula. It was here that the Allies attempted their ill- fated landings, giving Mustafa Kemal the opportunity to throw them back and thwart their attempt to force the Dardanelles (February 1915–January 1916). During the battle, Mustafa Kemal was hit by a piece of shrapnel, which lodged in the watch he carried in his breast pocket and thus failed to cause him serious injury. His success at Gallipoli thrust Mustafa Kemal onto the world scene. He was hailed as the “Saviour of Istanbul” and was promoted to colonel on June 1, 1915. In 1916 Mustafa Kemal was assigned to the Russian front and promoted to general, acquiring the title of pasha. He was the only Turkish general to win any victories over the Russians on the Eastern Front. Later that year, he took over the command of the Second Army in southeastern Anatolia. There he met Colonel İsmet (İnönü), who would become his closest ally in building the Turkish republic. The outbreak of the Russian Revolution in March 1917 made Mustafa Kemal available for service in the Ottoman provinces of Syria and Iraq, on which the British were advancing from their base in Egypt. He was appointed to the command of the Seventh Army in Syria, but he was appalled by the sad state of the army. Resigning his post, he returned without permission to Istanbul. He was placed on leave for three months and then assigned to accompany Crown Prince Mehmed Vahideddin on a state visit to Germany. On his return to Istanbul, Mustafa Kemal fell ill with kidney problems, most probably related to gonorrhea, which it is believed he had contracted earlier. (His physical problems would later require him to have a personal physician in constant attendance throughout his  Kemal Atatürk   years as president of the Turkish republic.) He went to Vienna for treatment and then to Carlsbad to recuperate. While he was in Carlsbad, Sultan Mehmed V died, and Vahideddin assumed the throne as Mehmed VI. Mustafa Kemal was recalled to Istanbul in June 1918. Through Enver’s machinations, the sultan assigned Mustafa Kemal to command the collapsing Ottoman forces in Syria. He found the situation there worse than he had imagined and withdrew northward to save the lives of as many of his soldiers as possible. Fighting was halted by the Armistice of Mudros (October 30, 1918). Shortly afterward, Enver and other leaders of the CUP fled to Germany, leaving the sultan to lead the government. To ensure the continuation of his rule, Mehmed VI was willing to cooperate with the Allies, who assumed control of the government. The nationalist movement and the war for independence The Allies did not wait for a peace treaty to begin claiming Ottoman territory. Early in December 1918, Allied troops occupied sections of Istanbul and set up an Allied military administration. On February 8, 1919, the French general Franchet d’Espèrey entered the city in a spectacle compared to the entrance of Mehmed the Conqueror in 1453—but this time signifying that Ottoman sovereignty over the imperial city was over. The Allies made plans to incorporate the provinces of eastern Anatolia into an independent Armenian state. French troops advanced into Cilicia in the southeast. Greece and Italy put forward competing claims for southwestern Anatolia. The Italians occupied Marmaris, Antalya, and Burdur, and on May 15, 1919, Greek troops landed at Izmir and began a drive into the interior of Anatolia, killing Turkish inhabitants and ravaging the countryside. Allied statesmen seemed to be abandoning Woodrow Wilson’s Fourteen Points in favour of the old imperialist views set down in the secret treaties and contained in their own secret ambitions. Meanwhile, Mustafa Kemal’s armies had been disbanded. He returned to Istanbul on November 13, 1919, just as ships of the Allied fleet sailed up the Bosporus. This scene, as well as the city’s occupation by British, French, and Italian troops, left a lasting impression on Mustafa Kemal. He was determined to oust them. He began meeting with selected friends to formulate a policy to save Turkey. Among these friends were Ali Fuat and Rauf (Orbay), the Ottoman naval hero. Ali Fuat was stationed in Anatolia and knew the situation there intimately. He and Mustafa Kemal developed a plan for an Anatolian national movement centred on Ankara. Kemal Atatürk   In various parts of Anatolia, Turks had already taken matters into their own hands, calling themselves associations for the defense of rights and organizing paramilitary units. They began to come into armed conflict with local non-Muslims, and it appeared that they might soon do so against the occupying forces as well. Fearing anarchy, the Allies urged the sultan to restore order in Anatolia. The grand vizier recommended Mustafa Kemal as a loyal officer who could be sent to Anatolia as inspector general of the Third Army. Mustafa Kemal contrived to get his orders written in such a way as to give him extraordinarily extensive powers. These included the authority to issue orders throughout Anatolia and to command obedience from provincial governors. Modern Turkish history may be said to begin on the morning of May 19, 1919, with Mustafa Kemal’s landing at Samsun, on the Black Sea coast of Anatolia. So psychologically meaningful was this date for Mustafa Kemal that, when in later life he was asked to provide his date of birth for an encyclopaedia article, he gave it as May 19, 1919. Abandoning his official reason for being in Anatolia—to restore order—he headed inland for Amasya. There he told a cheering crowd that the sultan was the prisoner of the Allies and that he had come to prevent the nation from slipping through the fingers of its people. This became his message to the Turks of Anatolia. The Allies pressured the sultan to recall Mustafa Kemal, who ignored all communications from Istanbul. The sultan dismissed him and telegraphed all provincial governors, instructing them to ignore Mustafa Kemal’s orders. Imperial orders for his arrest were circulated. Mustafa Kemal avoided dismissal from the army by officially resigning late on the evening of July 7. As a civilian, he pressed on with his retinue from Sivas to Erzurum, where General Kâzim Karabekir, commander of the XV Army Corps of 18,000 men, was headquartered. At this critical moment, when Mustafa Kemal had no military support or official status, Kâzim threw in his lot with Mustafa Kemal, placing his troops at Mustafa Kemal’s disposal. This was a crucial turning point in the struggle for independence. Kâzim had called for a congress of all defense-of-rights associations to be held in Erzurum on July 23, 1919. Mustafa Kemal was elected head of the Erzurum Congress and thereby gained an official status. The congress drafted a document covering the six eastern provinces of the empire. Later known as the National Pact, it affirmed the inviolability of the Ottoman “frontiers”—that is, all the Ottoman lands inhabited by Turks when the Armistice of Mudros was signed. It also created a provisional government, revoked the  Kemal Atatürk   special status arrangements for the minorities of the Ottoman Empire (the capitulations), and set up a steering committee, which then elected Mustafa Kemal as head. Mustafa Kemal sought to extend the National Pact to the entire Ottoman-Muslim population of the empire. To that end, he called a national congress that met in Sivas and ratified the pact. He exposed attempts by the sultan’s government to arrest him and to disrupt the Sivas Congress. The grand vizier in Istanbul was driven from office. The new government, which was sympathetic to the nationalist movement, restored Mustafa Kemal’s military rank and decorations. Unconvinced of the sultan’s ability to rid the country of the Allied occupation, Mustafa Kemal established the seat of his provisional government in Ankara, 300 miles (480 km) from Istanbul. There he would be safer from both the sultan and the Allies. This proved a wise decision. On March 16, 1920, in Istanbul, the Allies arrested leading nationalist sympathizers, including Rauf, and sent them to Malta. The conciliatory Istanbul government fell and was replaced by reactionaries who dissolved the parliament and pressured the religious dignitaries into declaring Mustafa Kemal and his associates infidels worthy of being shot on sight. The die was cast—it would be the sultan’s government or Mustafa Kemal’s. Many prominent Turks escaped from Istanbul to Ankara, including İsmet and, after him, Fevzi (Çakmak), the sultan’s war minister. Fevzi became Mustafa Kemal’s chief of the general staff. New elections were held, and a parliament, called the Grand National Assembly (GNA), met in Ankara on April 23, 1920. The assembly elected Mustafa Kemal as its president. In June 1920 the Allies handed the sultan the Treaty of Sèvres, which he signed on August 10, 1920. By the provisions of this treaty, the Ottoman state was greatly reduced in size, with Greece one of the major beneficiaries. Armenia was declared independent. Mustafa Kemal repudiated the treaty. Having received military aid from the Soviet Union, he set out to drive the Greeks from Anatolia and Thrace and to subdue the new Armenian state. As the war against the Greeks started to go well for Mustafa Kemal’s forces, France and Italy negotiated with the nationalist government in Ankara. They withdrew their troops from Anatolia. This left the Armenians in southeastern Anatolia without the protection of the French troops. With the French and Italians out of the picture, Kâzim then moved against the Armenian state. He was assisted by the Bolsheviks, who had established  Kemal Atatürk   relations with the government of the GNA. Deserting their Armenian protégés, the Russians supplied the nationalists with weapons and ammunition and joined the assault on the Armenian Socialist Republic, which had been their own creation. This combined attack was too much for the Armenians, who were crushed in October and November 1920; they surrendered early in November. By the Treaty of Alexandropol (December 3, 1920) and the Treaty of Moscow (March 16, 1921), the nationalists regained the eastern provinces, as well as the cities of Kars and Ardahan, and the Soviet Union became the first nation to recognize the nationalist government in Ankara. Turkey’s eastern borders were fixed at the Arpa and Aras rivers. The Greeks were more difficult to overcome, as they continued the advance toward Ankara which had begun in June 1920. By the end of July they had taken Bursa and were pushing on toward Ankara. Ali Fuat was relieved as commander on this front and replaced by İsmet. The Turkish army stood its ground at the İnönü River, north of Kütahya. They threw the Greeks back on January 10, 1921, at the First Battle of the İnönü. The Greeks did not resume their offensive until March 1921. İsmet again met them at the İnönü River, in a battle that raged from March 27 to April 1. On the evening of April 6–7, 1921, the Greeks broke off the engagement and retreated. In 1934, when the Turks were required by law to take last names, İsmet assumed the surname İnönü in memory of these important victories. Undaunted, the Greeks launched another offensive on July 13, 1921. İsmet fell back to the Sakarya River, so close to Ankara that the artillery fire could be heard there. Opposition to Mustafa Kemal developed in the GNA, led by Kâzim, who had grown jealous. The opposition demanded that Mustafa Kemal’s powers be curtailed so that a new policy could be developed. In addition they sought to have Mustafa Kemal assume personal direction of the war against the Greeks, anticipating a Greek victory that would result in the destruction of Mustafa Kemal’s stature and charisma. On August 4, Mustafa Kemal agreed, on the condition, which was accepted, that he be granted all the powers assigned to the GNA. He then assumed the role of commander in chief with total authority. He defeated the Greeks at the Battle of the Sakarya (August 23–September 13, 1921) and initiated an offensive (August 26–September 9, 1922) that pushed the Greeks to the sea at Izmir. With Anatolia rid of most of the Allies, the GNA, at the behest of Mustafa Kemal, voted on November 1, 1922, to abolish the sultanate. This was soon followed by the flight into exile of Sultan Mehmed VI on November 17. The Allies then invited the Ankara government to  Kemal Atatürk   discussions that resulted in the signing of the Treaty of Lausanne on July 24, 1923. This treaty fixed the European border of Turkey at the Maritsa River in eastern Thrace. The nationalists occupied Istanbul on October 2. Ankara was named the capital, and on October 29 the Turkish republic was proclaimed. Turkey was now in complete control of its territory and sovereignty. The Turkish republic Mustafa Kemal then embarked upon the reform of his country, his goal being to bring it into the 20th century. His instrument was the Republican People’s Party, formed on August 9, 1923, to replace the defense-of-rights associations. His program was embodied in the party’s “Six Arrows”: republicanism, nationalism, populism, statism (state-owned and state-operated industrialization aimed at making Turkey self-sufficient as a 20th-century industrialized state), secularism, and revolution. The guiding principle was the existence of a permanent state of revolution, meaning continuing change in the state and society. The caliphate was abolished on March 3, 1924 (since the early 16th century, the Ottoman sultans had laid claim to the title of caliph of the Muslims); the religious schools were dismantled at the same time. Abolition of the religious courts followed on April 8. In 1925, wearing the fez was prohibited—thereafter Turks wore Western-style headdress. Mustafa Kemal went on a speaking tour of Anatolia during which he wore a European-style hat, setting an example for the Turkish people. In Istanbul and elsewhere there was a run on materials for making hats. In the same year, the religious brotherhoods, strongholds of conservatism, were outlawed. The emancipation of women was encouraged by Mustafa Kemal’s marriage in 1923 to a Western-educated woman, Latife Hanım (they were divorced in 1925), and was set in motion by a number of laws. In December 1934, women were given the vote for parliamentary members and were made eligible to hold parliamentary seats. Almost overnight the whole system of Islamic law was discarded. From February to June 1926 the Swiss civil code, the Italian penal code, and the German commercial code were adopted wholesale. As a result, women’s emancipation was strengthened by the abolition of polygamy, marriage was made a civil contract, and divorce was recognized as a civil action. A reform of truly revolutionary proportions was the replacement of the Arabic script—in which the Ottoman Turkish language had been written for centuries—by the Latin  Kemal Atatürk   alphabet. This took place officially in November 1928, setting Turkey on the path to achieving one of the highest literacy rates in the Middle East. Once again Mustafa Kemal went into the countryside, and with chalk and a blackboard he demonstrated the new alphabet to the Turkish people and explained how the letters should be pronounced. Education benefited from this reform, as the youth of Turkey, cut off from the past with its emphasis on religion, were encouraged to take advantage of new educational opportunities that gave access to the Western scientific and humanistic traditions. Another important step was the adoption of surnames or family names, which was decreed by the GNA in 1934. The assembly gave Mustafa Kemal the name Atatürk (“Father of the Turks”). After having settled Turkey firmly within its national borders and set it on the path of modernization, Atatürk sought to develop his country’s foreign policy in similar fashion. First and foremost, he decided that Turkey would not pursue any irredentist claims except for the eventual incorporation of the Alexandretta region, which he felt was included within the boundaries set by the National Pact. He settled matters with Great Britain in a treaty signed on June 5, 1926. It called for Turkey to renounce its claims to Mosul in return for a 10 percent interest in the oil produced there. Atatürk also sought reconciliation with Greece; this was achieved through a treaty of friendship signed on December 30, 1930. Minority populations were exchanged on both sides, borders were set, and military problems such as naval equality in the eastern Mediterranean were ironed out. This ambitious program of forced modernization was not accomplished without strain and bloodshed. In February 1925 the Kurds of southwestern Anatolia raised the banner of revolt in the name of Islam. It took two months to put the revolt down; its leader Şeyh Said was then hanged. In June 1926 a plot by several disgruntled politicians to assassinate Atatürk was discovered, and the 13 ringleaders were tried and hanged. There were other trials and executions, but under Atatürk the country was steadfastly steered toward becoming a modern state with a minimum of repression. There was a high degree of consensus among the ruling elite about the goals of the society. As many of those goals were achieved, however, many Turks wished to see a more democratic regime. Atatürk even experimented in 1930 with the creation of an opposition party led by his longtime associate Ali Fethi, but its immediate and overwhelming success caused Atatürk to squash it. Kemal Atatürk   Atatürk Mausoleum In his later years Atatürk grew more remote from the Turkish people. He had the Dolmabahçe Palace in Istanbul, formerly a main residence of the sultans, refurbished and spent more time there. Always a heavy drinker who ate little, he began to decline in health. His illness, cirrhosis of the liver, was not diagnosed until too late. He bore the pain of the last few months of his life with great character and dignity, and on November 10, 1938, he died at 9:05 AM in Dolmabahçe. His state funeral was an occasion for enormous outpourings of grief from the Turkish people. His body was transported through Istanbul and from there to Ankara, where it awaited a suitable final resting place. This was constructed years later: a mausoleum in Ankara contains Atatürk’s sarcophagus and a museum devoted to his memory. Atatürk is omnipresent in Turkey. His portrait is in every home and place of business and on the postage and bank notes. His words are chiseled on important buildings. Statues of him abound. Turkish politicians, regardless of party affiliation, claim to be the inheritors of Atatürk’s mantle, but none has matched his breadth of vision, dedication, and selflessness. Norman Itzkowitz",

Kenneth Kaunda
Kenneth Kaunda
Kenneth Kaunda, in full Kenneth David Kaunda,
(born April 28, 1924, Lubwa, near Chinsali, Northern
Rhodesia [now Zambia]—died June 17, 2021,
Lusaka, Zambia), politician who led Zambia to
independence in 1964 and served as that country’s
president until 1991.
Early years
Kaunda’s father, who was from Nyasaland (now Malawi), was a schoolteacher; his mother,
also a teacher, was the first African woman to teach in colonial Zambia. Both taught among
the Bemba ethnic group in northern Zambia, where young Kaunda received his early
education, completing secondary school in the early 1940s. Like the majority of Africans in
colonial Zambia who achieved some measure of middle-class status, he also began to
teach, first in colonial Zambia and in the middle 1940s in Tanganyika (now Tanzania).
Struggle against colonial rule
Kaunda returned to Zambia in 1949. In that year he became interpreter and adviser on
African affairs to Sir Stewart Gore-Browne, a liberal white settler and a member of the
Northern Rhodesian Legislative Council. Kaunda acquired knowledge of the colonial
government as well as political skills, both of which served him well when later that year
he joined the African National Congress (ANC), the first major anticolonial organization in
Northern Rhodesia. In the early 1950s Kaunda became the ANC’s secretary-general,
functioning as its chief organizing officer, a role that brought him into close contact with
the movement’s rank and file. Thus, when the leadership of the ANC clashed over strategy
in 1958–59, Kaunda carried a major part of the ANC operating structure into a new
organization, the Zambia African National Congress.
Kaunda became president of the new organization and skillfully used it to forge a militant
policy against the British plan for a federation of the three central African colonies—
Southern Rhodesia, Northern Rhodesia, and Nyasaland. African leaders opposed and feared
any such federation because it would tend to place ultimate power in the hands of a white
minority of settlers. Kaunda employed the Zambia congress as an instrument for executing
what he called “positive nonviolent action,” a form of civil disobedience against the
federation policy. His campaign had two major results: first, the British government

modified the federation policy and eventually agreed to discard it; second, the
imprisonment of Kaunda and other militant leaders elevated them to the status of national
heroes in the eyes of the people. Thus, from 1960 on, the nationwide support of Zambia’s
independence movement was secured, as was too the dominant status of Kenneth Kaunda
in that movement.
Kaunda was released from prison by the colonial government on January 8, 1960. At the
end of that month he was elected president of the United National Independence Party
(UNIP), which had been formed in October 1959 by Mainza Chona, a militant nationalist
who was disenchanted with the older ANC. The UNIP enjoyed spectacular growth,
claiming 300,000 members by June 1960. In December 1960 the British colonial
authorities invited Kaunda and several other UNIP leaders to participate in discussions on
the status of the three colonies at a conference in London. Early in the following year the
British government announced that formal decolonization of Zambia would commence.
The first major elections leading to final decolonization were held in October 1962. The
constitutional proposals upon which the election was based provided the European settlers
in Northern Rhodesia with a disproportionate share of the votes. Yet the two major African
parties—the UNIP and ANC—gained a majority of the votes. The UNIP was the winner,
gaining 15 of the 37 seats in the new Legislative Council.
The UNIP’s success was attributed overwhelmingly to the leadership of Kaunda. He had
been astute both in allaying the European settlers’ fears that an African regime would
unfairly disregard their interests and in quelling the factionalism prevalent in large sections
of the country’s African population. It was this same skill that enabled Kaunda to negotiate
further constitutional advances, and in 1964 Zambia was granted independence with
Kaunda as its president.
President of Zambia
Like other African leaders, Kaunda faced many complex postindependence problems,
especially the issue of tribalism. He succeeded in continuing to negotiate on this issue,
saving Zambia the trauma of tribal civil war. Nevertheless, interparty political violence
occurred during the elections of 1968, in which Kaunda and his party were returned to
power. In response, Kaunda in 1972 imposed one-party rule on Zambia, and in 1973 he
introduced a new constitution that ensured his party’s uncontested rule.
In the 1970s Kaunda’s government acquired a majority interest in the country’s copper-
mining operations and undertook to manage other industries as well. While investing large

sums in the mining sector, the government neglected agriculture while nevertheless having
to spend increasing sums on subsidized food for the urban poor. These policies reduced
agricultural production and increased Zambia’s dependence on exports of copper and on
foreign loans and aid. From the 1970s on, the result of these policies was the progressive
impoverishment of Zambia; unemployment rose, living standards steadily declined, and the
provision of education and other social services decayed. In foreign affairs, Kaunda led
other countries of southern Africa in confronting the white-minority governments of
Rhodesia (now Zimbabwe) and South Africa. He imposed economic sanctions against
Rhodesia in the 1970s at great cost to his country’s own economy, and in the late 1970s he
allowed Zambia to be used as a base by black nationalist guerrillas led by Joshua Nkomo.
In 1976 Kaunda assumed emergency powers, and he was reelected as president in one-
candidate elections in 1978 and 1983. Several attempted coups against him in the early
1980s were squelched. The Zambian economy continued to deteriorate owing to a fall in
the world price of copper (Zambia’s chief export), the rising price of oil (its chief import),
the withdrawal of foreign aid and investment by developed countries, and worsening
corruption within Kaunda’s government. With public dissatisfaction mounting and a
credible political opposition in the process of formation, Kaunda in 1990 legalized
opposition parties and set the stage for free, multiparty elections in 1991. In the elections,
held late that year, Kaunda and the UNIP were defeated by the Movement for Multiparty
Democracy (MMD) in a landslide. Kaunda’s successor, Frederick Chiluba, took office on
November 2, 1991.
After the presidency
After leaving office, Kaunda clashed frequently with Chiluba’s government and the MMD.
He planned to run against Chiluba in the 1996 presidential election but was barred from
doing so after constitutional amendments were passed that made him ineligible. On
December 25, 1997, Kaunda was arrested on charges of inciting an attempted coup that had
occurred earlier that year in October. He was released six days later, but he was placed
under house arrest until all charges were withdrawn in June 1998. The next month, Kaunda
announced that he would resign from his role as UNIP’s president once a successor was
chosen. However, the lack of agreement regarding his successor caused a rift within the
UNIP, and ultimately Kaunda did not resign until 2000. In March 1999 a judge ruled that
Kaunda should be stripped of his Zambian citizenship because his parents were from
Malawi and, furthermore, because of that fact, Kaunda had held office illegally for most of
his period in government. Kaunda mounted a challenge, and his citizenship was restored
the next year when the petition that generated the court ruling was withdrawn.

In 2002 Kaunda was appointed the Balfour African President-in-Residence at Boston
University in the United States, a position he held until 2004. In 2003 he was awarded the
Grand Order of the Eagle in Zambia by Chiluba’s successor, Pres. Levy Mwanawasa.

Khalīl Ibrāhīm al-Wazīr, byname Abū Jihād, (born October 10, 1935, Ramla, Palestine
[now in Israel]—died April 16, 1988, Tunis, Tunisia), Palestinian leader who became the
military strategist and second in command of the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO).
Wazīr fled from Ramla with his family during the 1948 war that followed the creation of
the State of Israel. He grew up in the Gaza Strip, where he was educated by the United
Nations Relief and Works Agency. He met future PLO leader Yāsir ʿArafāt in 1951 while
attending college in Cairo, and together they organized anti-Israel guerrilla actions and
founded the militant organization Fatah (1958), which merged with smaller groups to form
the PLO (1964). As ʿArafāt’s deputy and a moderate within the PLO, Wazīr often
negotiated with PLO extremists, maintained diplomatic relations with other countries, and
reportedly planned military strategies and arranged arms purchases for Fatah and the PLO.
After the PLO was expelled from Jordan in 1971, he eventually became an advocate of
rapprochement with Jordan and played a role in increasing the PLO’s emphasis on work in
the West Bank and Gaza Strip. These efforts contributed to a general Palestinian uprising
known as the intifāḍah in 1987. He was killed in his home in Tunis by Israeli commandos.

Khazʿal Khan
Khazʿal Khan, (born 1861, Moḥammerah, Qājār Iran—died May 25, 1936, Tehrān), Arab
sheikh (ruler) of Moḥammerah (now Khorramshahr) who attempted to create an
independent state in the oil-rich Iranian region of Khūzestān.
Khazʿal was said to be instrumental in having his brother, Sheikh Mizʿal, assassinated in
June 1897. He then became the ruler of Moḥammerah and the paramount chief of the Arab
tribes of Khūzestān. Though nominally owing allegiance to the central government in
Tehrān, the Arab sheikhdom of Moḥammerah, which differed culturally and ethnically
from the rest of Iran, enjoyed virtual autonomy in its internal affairs. Khazʿal’s only major
tie to the central government was the annual payment of nominal taxes.
Sheikh Khazʿal believed that the Iranian state would eventually disintegrate and that its
dominions would be partitioned. He hoped to establish an independent Arab state in
Khūzestān. From 1898 onward he made diplomatic overtures to the British government,
which had important strategic and commercial interests in the area. He promised to
maintain public security in the area in return for British support of his autonomy and the
implicit agreement that he would become an independent ruler if the central government
should disintegrate.
The discovery of oil in Khūzestān in 1908 by a British-owned company (of which the
British government became a 51 percent stockholder in 1914) strengthened Khazʿal’s ties
with the British, who in 1910 knighted him and awarded him the important decoration of
Knight Commander of the Indian Empire. With the outbreak of World War I (1914–18), he
actively supported the British government, while the Iranian government remained neutral.
Khazʿal’s power reached its zenith in 1919.
In 1921, however, when the British failed to establish a protectorate over Iran, Khazʿal’s
position was weakened. He opposed the centralizing policies of Reza Khan (later Reza
Shah Pahlavi, who became king of Iran in 1925), and he actively resisted the central
government. Khazʿal’s forces were defeated in October 1924, and in early 1925 he was
arrested and exiled to Tehrān, where he died under house arrest. With his removal from the
area, Khūzestān lost its autonomy within the kingdom of Iran.

In 1863 Botev was sent to complete his education in Russia, where he was much influenced
by nihilist ideas. He returned to Bulgaria in 1867 but then fled to Romania. There he lived
in poverty, devoting himself to the Bulgarian liberation movement through journalistic,
literary, and organizational activity. A collection of his patriotic verses, Pesni u stihove

Ki Hadjar Dewantoro
Ki Hadjar Dewantoro, Dewantoro also spelled Dewantara, original name Raden Mas
(Lord) Suwardi Surjaningrat, (born May 2, 1889, Yogyakarta, Java, Dutch East Indies
[now Indonesia]—died April 26, 1959, Yogyakarta), founder of the Taman Siswa (literally
“Garden of Students”) school system, an influential and widespread network of schools
that encouraged modernization but also promoted indigenous Indonesian culture.
Dewantoro was born into a noble family of Yogyakarta and attended a Dutch-sponsored
medical school but failed to complete the course. Active in the nationalist cause, he
belonged to a faction favouring direct action and the use of Western methods to destroy the
power of the Dutch. He was also a member of the Bandung chapter of Sarekat Islām
(“Islamic Association”) and a founder of the Socialist Indische Partij (“Indies Party”). An
article he wrote during this period, “If I Were a Netherlander,” published in the Indische
Partij’s De Express, led to his exile to the Netherlands between 1913 and 1918.
In the Netherlands he became converted to the idea of using Indonesian cultural traditions
to cope with the problems posed by Dutch colonial rule. He felt that education was the best
means to strengthen Indonesians, and he was deeply influenced by the progressive theories
of the Italian educational reformer Maria Montessori and by the Indian poet and
philosopher Rabindranath Tagore. The first Taman Siswa schools were established in Java
in July 1922. Instruction, carried on informally, emphasized traditional skills and values of
Javanese life, particularly music and dance. Western subjects were taught, too, in order to
help students cope with the demands of modern life. Overcoming initial official hostility,
the Taman Siswa schools had spread throughout the archipelago and were by the late 1930s
subsidized by the Dutch colonial government. Based on traditional Javanese concepts, the
Taman Siswa schools appealed primarily to those segments of Indonesian society termed
abangan, in which the Islamic faith is less deeply entrenched. Dewantoro continued his
leadership of Taman Siswa after the war and upon his death was acclaimed a national hero.

Konni Zilliacus
Konni Zilliacus, Swedish Konrad Viktor Zilliacus, (born 1855, Finland—died June 19,
1924, Helsinki), Finnish patriot and leader of a daring anti-Russian Finnish nationalist
group during the Russo-Japanese War (1904–05) and the Russian Revolution of 1905, who
inspired a later generation of Finnish anti-Russian activists.
Zilliacus learned journalism in Chicago in the 1890s. He returned to Russian-controlled
Finland and began a career of smuggling revolutionary propaganda and arms from Sweden
by sea into Finland. In 1904 he was an organizer of the Activist Opposition Party, an
underground revolutionary group; he also served as editor of its widely disseminated
newspaper Fria Ord (“Free Word”). Beginning with the Russo-Japanese War and the first
stirrings of unrest in Russia, Zilliacus limited his smuggling almost exclusively to arms, not
only for Finnish groups but also for other nationality groups and revolutionary
organizations in Russia.
Zilliacus is best known for the John Grafton affair of 1905–06. The John Grafton was the
largest of three vessels that Zilliacus sought to land on the Finnish coast. He guided the
ships, which were laden with arms purchased with Japanese money and destined for
various anti-Tsarist groups, through many near disasters. In the end, the John Grafton went
aground off the Finnish coast, and most of its cargo had to be blown up, though some arms
were landed.
Zilliacus was again active against Russian rule during World War I. From bases in Sweden
and in Switzerland, he supported the German-trained Finnish Jäger battalions, whose
members were probably inspired in part by his own exploits. His son, also named Konni
Zilliacus, was a well-known member of the left wing of the British Labour movement and
was for many years a member of the House of Commons.

1874, Pärnu district, Estonia, Russian Empire—died
Jan. 18, 1956, Kalinin [now Tver] oblast, Russia,
U.S.S.R.), Estonian statesman who served as the last
president of Estonia (1938–40) before its
incorporation into the Soviet Union in 1940.
Of peasant stock, Päts was educated in the law but began a career in journalism in 1901,
when he founded the Estonian-language newspaper Teataja (“Announcer”), which
reflected Päts’s socialistic leanings. In 1904 Päts became deputy mayor of Tallinn. During
an Estonian rising in connection with the 1905 Russian Revolution, Päts, although he had
called for restraint, was sentenced to death and had to flee Estonia. He was not able to
return until 1910, at which time he served a brief prison term.
Active in the movement for Estonian independence after 1917, Päts became head of a
provisional government when independence was declared in February 1918. Almost
immediately, Päts was arrested by Estonia’s German occupiers, but he resumed his post
after the November 1918 armistice.
In 1921–22, 1923, and 1932–33 Päts served as riigivanem (equivalent to president and
prime minister) of Estonia. After a new constitution providing for a stronger executive was
approved in a 1933 referendum, Päts learned of a planned coup d’état by the fascist “Vap”
movement, which had sponsored the constitution. He arrested the leaders of the movement
and assumed dictatorial powers. Päts’s authoritarian regime lasted until the Soviet Union
occupied Estonia in June 1940. He was deported to the U.S.S.R. at the start of the
occupation and died there.

Kumaraswami Kamaraj
Kumaraswami Kamaraj, (born July 15, 1903,
Virudunagar, India—died October 2, 1975, Madras
[now Chennai]), Indian independence activist and
statesman who rose from humble beginnings to
become a legislator in the Madras Presidency (an
administrative unit of British India that encompassed
much of southern India), chief minister (head of
government) of the successor Madras state in independent India (now largely occupied by
Tamil Nadu state and also including portions of Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, and Kerala
states), and president of the Indian National Congress (Congress Party).
Kamaraj was born in what is now southern Tamil Nadu to a family of the Nadar (next-to-
lowest) caste. His father, a coconut merchant, died when Kamaraj was a young boy. When
he was 12 years old, he dropped out of school and began working in a cloth shop. He soon
found himself drawn to the Indian independence movement against British rule and began
attending public meetings held by local Congress Party leaders and later volunteering in
various capacities (e.g., organizing fund-raising rallies for the party in his home district).
Kamaraj joined the party at age 17, just as the noncooperation movement (1920–22) led by
Mohandas K. Gandhi was getting under way, and became a full-time worker for the
independence cause. His participation in the Salt March act of civil disobedience
(satyagraha) in 1930 earned him a sentence of two years in prison (he was released in 1931
as part of the Gandhi-Irwin Pact agreement). He would be imprisoned several more times
by the British, notably in 1942–45 for his prominent role in the Congress Party’s large-
scale Quit India campaign against British rule. He used his time in prison to give himself
the education he had not received as a child.
Kamaraj was elected to the Madras Presidency legislature in 1937 and again in 1946. In
1936 he had been named general secretary of the Madras branch of the Congress Party, and
in 1940 he became its president. In 1947 he was elevated to the Working Committee of the
national party, and he remained associated with that group until 1969. He was also a
member of the Constituent Assembly that in 1946 drafted the constitution for soon-to-be
independent India. In 1951 Kamaraj contested and won a seat in the elections to the first
Lok Sabha (lower chamber of the Indian parliament).

In 1954 Kamaraj was elected chief minister for Madras state, and in 1957 he won a seat in
the state legislative assembly. While in office he was credited with greatly advancing
education in the state through programs that built new schools, introduced compulsory
education, and provided meals and free uniforms for students. His administration improved
the state’s economy by implementing a large number of irrigation projects and enacting
laws that protected small farmers from exploitation by landlords. In 1963 he voluntarily left
office under what came to be known as the Kamaraj Plan, which called for the voluntary
resignations of high-level national and state officials in order to devote their efforts to
rebuilding the Congress Party at the grassroots level following India’s disastrous border
war with China.
Soon thereafter he was appointed president of the party. He was largely responsible for
placing Lal Bahadur Shastri in the prime ministership in 1964 and Indira Gandhi in 1966—
both times defeating the future prime minister and Gandhi opponent Morarji Desai.
Kamaraj was defeated in the 1967 state legislative elections. Soon after, he was
maneuvered out of the party leadership by Gandhi as she consolidated her power. In
January 1969 he won a by-election to the Lok Sabha, and later that year he was part of an
old-guard leaders’ group that tried to remove Gandhi from power. The party split, however,
leaving Kamaraj and his associates with a small splinter group. He nonetheless won
reelection to his seat in 1971 and retained it until his death.
Kamaraj’s low social origins contributed to his success in bringing low-caste and Dalit
(formerly “untouchable”) voters into the Congress fold. He underscored his strong belief in
personal contact by visiting nearly all the villages in his state more than once. In 1976 he
was awarded the Bharat Ratna, India’s highest civilian award.

Kwame Nkrumah
Kwame Nkrumah
Kwame Nkrumah, (born September 1909, Nkroful,
Gold Coast [now Ghana]—died April 27, 1972,
Bucharest, Romania), Ghanaian nationalist leader
who led the Gold Coast’s drive for independence
from Britain and presided over its emergence as the
new nation of Ghana. He headed the country from
independence in 1957 until he was overthrown by a
coup in 1966.
Early years
Kwame Nkrumah’s father was a goldsmith and his mother a retail trader. Baptized a
Roman Catholic, Nkrumah spent nine years at the Roman Catholic elementary school in
nearby Half Assini. After graduation from Achimota College in 1930, he started his career
as a teacher at Roman Catholic junior schools in Elmina and Axim and at a seminary.
Increasingly drawn to politics, Nkrumah decided to pursue further studies in the United
States. He entered Lincoln University in Pennsylvania in 1935 and, after graduating in
1939, obtained master’s degrees from Lincoln and from the University of Pennsylvania. He
studied the literature of socialism, notably Karl Marx and Vladimir Lenin, and of
nationalism, especially Marcus Garvey, the Black American leader of the 1920s.
Eventually, Nkrumah came to describe himself as a “nondenominational Christian and a
Marxist socialist.” He also immersed himself in political work, reorganizing and becoming
president of the African Students’ Organization of the United States and Canada. He left the
United States in May 1945 and went to England, where he organized the 5th Pan-African
Congress in Manchester.
Meanwhile, in the Gold Coast, J.B. Danquah had formed the United Gold Coast
Convention (UGCC) to work for self-government by constitutional means. Invited to serve
as the UGCC’s general secretary, Nkrumah returned home in late 1947. As general
secretary, he addressed meetings throughout the Gold Coast and began to create a mass
base for the new movement. When extensive riots occurred in February 1948, the British
briefly arrested Nkrumah and other leaders of the UGCC.
When a split developed between the middle-class leaders of the UGCC and the more
radical supporters of Nkrumah, he formed in June 1949 the new Convention Peoples’ Party

(CPP), a mass-based party that was committed to a program of immediate self-government.
In January 1950, Nkrumah initiated a campaign of “positive action,” involving nonviolent
protests, strikes, and noncooperation with the British colonial authorities.
From prison to prime ministry
In the ensuing crisis, services throughout the country were disrupted, and Nkrumah was
again arrested and sentenced to one year’s imprisonment. But the Gold Coast’s first general
election (February 8, 1951) demonstrated the support the CPP had already won. Elected to
Parliament, Nkrumah was released from prison to become leader of government business
and, in 1952, prime minister of the Gold Coast.
When the Gold Coast and the British Togoland trust territory became an independent state
within the British Commonwealth—as Ghana—in March 1957, Nkrumah became the new
nation’s first prime minister. In 1958 Nkrumah’s government legalized the imprisonment
without trial of those it regarded as security risks. It soon became apparent that Nkrumah’s
style of government was to be authoritarian. Nkrumah’s popularity in the country rose,
however, as new roads, schools, and health facilities were built and as the policy of
Africanization created better career opportunities for Ghanaians.
By a plebiscite of 1960 Ghana became a republic and Nkrumah became its president, with
wide legislative and executive powers under a new constitution. Nkrumah then
concentrated his attention on campaigning for the political unity of Black Africa, and he
began to lose touch with realities in Ghana. His administration became involved in
magnificent but often ruinous development projects, so that a once-prosperous country
became crippled with foreign debt. His government’s Second Development Plan,
announced in 1959, had to be abandoned in 1961 when the deficit in the balance of
payments rose to more than $125 million. Contraction of the economy led to widespread
labour unrest and to a general strike in September 1961. From that time Nkrumah began to
evolve a much more rigorous apparatus of political control and to turn increasingly to the
communist countries for support.
President of Ghana and afterward
The attempted assassination of Nkrumah at Kulugungu in August 1962—the first of several
—led to his increasing seclusion from public life and to the growth of a personality cult, as
well as to a massive buildup of the country’s internal security forces. Early in 1964 Ghana
was officially designated a one-party state, with Nkrumah as life president of both nation
and party. While the administration of the country passed increasingly into the hands of

self-serving and corrupt party officials, Nkrumah busied himself with the ideological
education of a new generation of Black African political activists. Meanwhile, the
economic crisis in Ghana worsened and shortages of foodstuffs and other goods became
chronic. On February 24, 1966, while Nkrumah was visiting Beijing, the army and police
in Ghana seized power. Returning to West Africa, Nkrumah found asylum in Guinea, where
he spent the remainder of his life. He died of cancer in Bucharest in 1972.

Kārlis Ulmanis
Kārlis Ulmanis, (born September 4, 1877, Berze,
Latvia, Russian Empire—died 1942), a leader in the
fight for Latvian independence in the early decades of
the 20th century. He was the first head of the Latvian
Republic in 1918 and again in 1936–40 and was
premier in 1918, 1919–21, 1925–26, 1931–32, and
1934–40.
Ulmanis studied agronomy in Germany as a young man and afterward worked to improve
dairy farming and cattle breeding in Latvia. During the period of upheaval at the time of
the Russian Revolution of 1905, he worked to promote freedom from Russia, which had
controlled the country for more than a century. The defeat of the revolution forced Ulmanis
to seek exile in the United States, where he taught in the agriculture department of the
University of Nebraska.
In 1913 he was granted amnesty by the Russian government and returned to Latvia. At the
time of the Russian Revolution of 1917, he founded the Latvian Farmers’ Union to press
for independence. Then with other nationalists he formed a Latvian national council that
proclaimed independence on November 18, 1918, and appointed Ulmanis head of the
provisional government.
He remained in power until June 1921, during the confused period immediately following
the end of World War I, when the new nation was forced to fight to maintain itself in the
face of threats, pressure, and military action from Russia, native Latvian Communists, and
German forces. With a Latvian army formed by Gen. Jānis Balodis and supported on
occasion by French and British naval forces and Polish troops, the new government was
able to clear the country of opposition. Ulmanis organized the election of a constituent
assembly, and the first Saeima (parliament) convened on August 11, 1920. That same
month peace was concluded with the Soviet Union.
Ulmanis again served as premier from December 1925 to May 1926 and from March 1931
to December 1932. He came to power for the last time on March 17, 1934, during a period

Lajos Kossuth
Lajos Kossuth
Lajos Kossuth, (born Sept. 19, 1802, Monok, Hung.—
died March 20, 1894, Turin, Italy), political reformer
who inspired and led Hungary’s struggle for
independence from Austria. His brief period of power
in the revolutionary years of 1848 and 1849, however,
was ended by Russian armies.
Early career
Kossuth’s father came of Slovak, his mother of local German stock. The family was noble
and of ancient creation but not wealthy, and Kossuth’s father earned his living as an
attorney for local landowning families. The Kossuths were Lutherans, and young Lajos
studied at the Protestant academy of Sárospatak. After applying unsuccessfully for a post in
government service, he found employment in his native county of Zemplén as agent to one
of his father’s clients, Countess Etelka Andrássy, with whom he formed an attachment. He
did notable work during the great cholera epidemic of 1831 but found his life narrow and
frustrating; he was also suffering, as he would all his life, from financial embarrassment. In
1832 his employer had him sent to the national Diet in Pozsony (now Bratislava) as
substitute delegate for one of her relatives.
Political journalism
At this “long Diet” the new generation of Hungary’s reformers was mounting its first full-
scale offensive against the absolutist and obscurantist system under which Hungary was
then ruled from Vienna, and in its excited atmosphere Kossuth developed his political and
social philosophy of advanced radicalism. There was no postulate of the European
liberalism of the day that he did not burn to see realized in Hungary—no abuse or injustice
there left unremedied. But liberty meant for him, above all else, national liberty, and he felt
passionately that, until Hungary enjoyed de facto the internal freedom to which its laws
entitled it, no social or economic progress was possible. The first battle, therefore, must be
the political one. Sanguine and impulsive, he was blind to the dangers involved in too
strong a challenge to Vienna.
Kossuth’s mandate did not entitle him to participate in the Diet’s debates, but he found a
way of voicing his views. At that time the Diet’s proceedings were not published, and
Kossuth hit on the idea of issuing letters describing them. These reports, which were not

verbatim records but colourful impressions barely distinguishable from political pamphlets,
were copied by hand by enthusiastic young helpers and circulated throughout Hungary.
Brilliantly written, they were widely and avidly read, and, when the Diet ended in 1836, the
county assembly of Pest invited him to write a similar series on its proceedings. Now,
however, he was no longer protected by parliamentary immunity, and on May 4, 1837, he
was arrested and, after 18 months’ detention, sentenced to three years’ imprisonment for
subversion.
Released under an amnesty in 1840, Kossuth found himself a popular hero. The proprietor
of a biweekly journal, the Pesti Hirlap, made him its editor. His articles were written in a
fluent and beguiling style and gained him innumerable devotees at the same time that they
alarmed the Austrian authorities, the Hungarian conservatives, and even Hungary’s
moderate reformers. He also antagonized the Croats and non-Magyars of Hungary by his
chauvinistic insistence on the supremacy of its Magyar element. In 1844 his publisher
dismissed him, and he was refused permission to start a journal of his own. Metternich
offered him journalistic employment in the service of the government, but this he refused.
His next enterprise, inspired by the writings of the German economist and industrial
promoter Friedrich List, was to found a society for promoting Hungarian industry, with the
ultimate objective of achieving greater economic independence. This program proved a
fiasco but afforded him a platform for continued agitation.
The revolution of 1848.
In 1847 the county of Pest elected Kossuth to represent it in the next Diet, in which he
assumed leadership of the “national opposition,” which had agreed on an extensive
program of political and social reform. The reformers made a little progress in subsidiary
fields, but deadlock had been reached on the central issue of political control when the
news of the revolution in Paris (February 1848) gave Kossuth his opportunity. On March 3,
in a speech of extraordinary power—for his tongue was as magical as his pen—he
demanded the removal of the dead hand of Viennese absolutism as the only way to
safeguard the liberties of Hungary and of all the peoples of the monarchy. He practically
dictated to the Diet an address to the crown, embodying the reformers’ program. When
news of the revolution in Vienna reached the Diet on March 14, Kossuth expanded the
address, and, as a member of the deputation that carried it to Vienna the next day, saw it
accepted by the panic-stricken court.
Count Lajos Batthyány, the new Hungarian prime minister, allotted Kossuth the portfolio of
finance in his government, a choice that proved dangerous, for the ultimate control of

finance proved, with that of the defense services, to be precisely the chief bone of
contention between Hungary and Vienna. Kossuth was soon at loggerheads with the new
Ministry of Finance in Vienna—meanwhile, he had made himself the life and soul of the
more extreme nationalist movement in Hungary, often to the embarrassment of his fellow
ministers, who were striving to prevent a breach with Vienna. Kossuth often acted without
consulting them or even in defiance of agreed decisions, appealing over their heads to the
public in a journal edited and mainly written by himself. Yet they dared not dismiss him
and could not even dispense with his services, for his nationwide popularity was their
greatest asset.
It was Kossuth who, so far as any Hungarian did so, precipitated the final clash by
persuading the Diet, in July, to tie the dispatch of Hungarian troops to Italy to political
conditions obviously unacceptable to Vienna, at the same time calling for a big national
force to defend Hungary against the danger he declared, not without reason, to be
threatening it from the Croats and Serbs. When, in September, the Austrian-inspired Croat
army invaded Hungary and Batthyány resigned, Kossuth became head of the committee of
national defense appointed by the Diet as provisional authority. He was now virtual dictator
of Hungary. The next months brought out all of his greatness and his weaknesses: his
magnetism and his courage, his intolerance and his lack of realism, his wanton provocation
of insuperable difficulties and his genius at overcoming them. No one but Kossuth could
have given his people the heart to face the overwhelming odds against them, but he
increased those odds by his intransigence and aggravated difficulties by his jealousy and
suspicion of his best general, Artúr Görgey, and by his meddling in military affairs. The
refusal of the Diet to recognize the abdication of the Austrian emperor Ferdinand I
(December 2) was his work, as was the Diet’s declaration of April 14, 1849, proclaiming
the dethronement of “the perjured House of Habsburg-Lorraine.” The Diet then elected
Kossuth himself “governor” of Hungary, but when, after the arrival of the Russian armies,
even he had to recognize the hopelessness of the situation, he resigned this post to Görgey
(August 11) and took refuge in Turkey.
Exile.
The Western powers put pressure on the sultan to refuse Austria’s and Russia’s demand for
his extradition, and Kossuth spent two years interned in Kütahya in Anatolia. The U.S.
government invited him to visit America and sent a frigate. He stopped in England on the
way, where he addressed a series of mass meetings, speaking in English, which he had
learned from the Bible and the works of William Shakespeare during his confinement. He
was received with unprecedented popular ovations, and his reception in the United States

was equally favourable, but in neither country could he obtain official support for
Hungary’s cause. He then settled in London. In correspondence with his followers at home,
he endeavoured to keep alive in them the spirit of resistance. At the persuasion of the
Italian patriot Giuseppe Mazzini, with whom he became intimate, he joined his
revolutionary committee. Having moderated his views on the question of nationalities, he
discussed with various circles, including the Moldavian and Serbian courts, plans—never
to be realized and perhaps never quite realistic—for uniting Hungary, Croatia, Serbia, and
Romania in a Danubian federation.
In 1859, when war between Austria and France was imminent, the French emperor
Napoleon III invited him in a personal interview to organize revolt in Hungary on the
outbreak of war. Kossuth agreed, subject to certain safeguards and conditions. Military
preparations were concerted with France and Piedmont, and Kossuth’s own eloquence
helped to deter Great Britain from intervening against France; but the plans collapsed
when, in July, Napoleon concluded an armistice with the Austrian emperor Francis Joseph
I, leaving the Hungarians to their fate.
The promising international conjuncture never recurred, and in the following years
Kossuth, living abroad in Turin, had to watch Hungary, guided by Ferenc Deák, move
toward reconciliation with the Austrian monarchy. He did so with bitterness in his heart,
and on the eve of the conclusion of the Austro-Hungarian Ausgleich, or Compromise of
1867, he published an open letter calling down woe upon the measure and its author. This
“Cassandra letter” stirred the opponents of the compromise but could not prevent its
adoption and subsequent maintenance. He spent his last years in loneliness, near-poverty,
and increasing infirmity, sadly aware that Hungary’s new leaders rejected the tenets to
which he remained unalterably attached. He died in 1894. His body was brought back to
Hungary and interred there amid nationwide mourning.
In 1841 Kossuth had married Terézia Meszlényi, who died in 1863. Their son, Ferenc
Kossuth, was for a time president of the Hungarian Party of Independence.
After his death, Kossuth remained a popular idol in Hungary, his name a symbol of the
aspiration for independence. His legend grew with the years and was further cultivated
after 1945, when Hungary had lost much of the independence for which Kossuth struggled.
Kossuth wrote one volume of autobiography that was published in English in 1880 as
Memories of My Exile. It mainly concerns his activities in 1859–61 and contains valuable
material on his interviews with Napoleon III, his dealings with the Italian statesman

The reformers made a little progress in subsidiary fields, but deadlock had been reached on the central issue of political control when the news of the revolution in Paris (February 1848) gave Kossuth his opportunity. On March 3, in a speech of extraordinary power—for his tongue was as magical as his pen—he demanded the removal of the dead hand of Viennese absolutism as the only way to safeguard the liberties of Hungary and of all the peoples of the monarchy. He practically dictated to the Diet an address to the crown, embodying the reformers’ program. When news of the revolution in Vienna reached the Diet on March 14, Kossuth expanded the address, and, as a member of the deputation that carried it to Vienna the next day, saw it accepted by the panic-stricken court. Count Lajos Batthyány, the new Hungarian prime minister, allotted Kossuth the portfolio of finance in his government, a choice that proved dangerous, for the ultimate control of  Lajos Kossuth   finance proved, with that of the defense services, to be precisely the chief bone of contention between Hungary and Vienna. Kossuth was soon at loggerheads with the new Ministry of Finance in Vienna—meanwhile, he had made himself the life and soul of the more extreme nationalist movement in Hungary, often to the embarrassment of his fellow ministers, who were striving to prevent a breach with Vienna. Kossuth often acted without consulting them or even in defiance of agreed decisions, appealing over their heads to the public in a journal edited and mainly written by himself. Yet they dared not dismiss him and could not even dispense with his services, for his nationwide popularity was their greatest asset. It was Kossuth who, so far as any Hungarian did so, precipitated the final clash by persuading the Diet, in July, to tie the dispatch of Hungarian troops to Italy to political conditions obviously unacceptable to Vienna, at the same time calling for a big national force to defend Hungary against the danger he declared, not without reason, to be threatening it from the Croats and Serbs. When, in September, the Austrian-inspired Croat army invaded Hungary and Batthyány resigned, Kossuth became head of the committee of national defense appointed by the Diet as provisional authority. He was now virtual dictator of Hungary. The next months brought out all of his greatness and his weaknesses: his magnetism and his courage, his intolerance and his lack of realism, his wanton provocation of insuperable difficulties and his genius at overcoming them. No one but Kossuth could have given his people the heart to face the overwhelming odds against them, but he increased those odds by his intransigence and aggravated difficulties by his jealousy and suspicion of his best general, Artúr Görgey, and by his meddling in military affairs. The refusal of the Diet to recognize the abdication of the Austrian emperor Ferdinand I (December 2) was his work, as was the Diet’s declaration of April 14, 1849, proclaiming the dethronement of “the perjured House of Habsburg-Lorraine.” The Diet then elected Kossuth himself “governor” of Hungary, but when, after the arrival of the Russian armies, even he had to recognize the hopelessness of the situation, he resigned this post to Görgey (August 11) and took refuge in Turkey. Exile. The Western powers put pressure on the sultan to refuse Austria’s and Russia’s demand for his extradition, and Kossuth spent two years interned in Kütahya in Anatolia. The U.S. government invited him to visit America and sent a frigate. He stopped in England on the way, where he addressed a series of mass meetings, speaking in English, which he had learned from the Bible and the works of William Shakespeare during his confinement. He was received with unprecedented popular ovations, and his reception in the United States  Lajos Kossuth   was equally favourable, but in neither country could he obtain official support for Hungary’s cause. He then settled in London. In correspondence with his followers at home, he endeavoured to keep alive in them the spirit of resistance. At the persuasion of the Italian patriot Giuseppe Mazzini, with whom he became intimate, he joined his revolutionary committee. Having moderated his views on the question of nationalities, he discussed with various circles, including the Moldavian and Serbian courts, plans—never to be realized and perhaps never quite realistic—for uniting Hungary, Croatia, Serbia, and Romania in a Danubian federation. In 1859, when war between Austria and France was imminent, the French emperor Napoleon III invited him in a personal interview to organize revolt in Hungary on the outbreak of war. Kossuth agreed, subject to certain safeguards and conditions. Military preparations were concerted with France and Piedmont, and Kossuth’s own eloquence helped to deter Great Britain from intervening against France; but the plans collapsed when, in July, Napoleon concluded an armistice with the Austrian emperor Francis Joseph I, leaving the Hungarians to their fate. The promising international conjuncture never recurred, and in the following years Kossuth, living abroad in Turin, had to watch Hungary, guided by Ferenc Deák, move toward reconciliation with the Austrian monarchy. He did so with bitterness in his heart, and on the eve of the conclusion of the Austro-Hungarian Ausgleich, or Compromise of 1867, he published an open letter calling down woe upon the measure and its author. This “Cassandra letter” stirred the opponents of the compromise but could not prevent its adoption and subsequent maintenance. He spent his last years in loneliness, near-poverty, and increasing infirmity, sadly aware that Hungary’s new leaders rejected the tenets to which he remained unalterably attached. He died in 1894. His body was brought back to Hungary and interred there amid nationwide mourning. In 1841 Kossuth had married Terézia Meszlényi, who died in 1863. Their son, Ferenc Kossuth, was for a time president of the Hungarian Party of Independence. After his death, Kossuth remained a popular idol in Hungary, his name a symbol of the aspiration for independence. His legend grew with the years and was further cultivated after 1945, when Hungary had lost much of the independence for which Kossuth struggled. Kossuth wrote one volume of autobiography that was published in English in 1880 as Memories of My Exile. It mainly concerns his activities in 1859–61 and contains valuable material on his interviews with Napoleon III, his dealings with the Italian statesman  Lajos Kossuth   Cavour, and his correspondence with the Balkan courts in connection with his plans for a Danubian federation.

Bratislava, Slovakia]—died Oct. 6, 1849, Pest [now in Budapest], Hung.), statesman who
during the revolution of 1848 was premier of the first Hungarian parliamentary government
and a martyr for Magyar independence.
The son of wealthy liberal landowners whose nobility dated to 1398, Batthyány entered the
military but left it in 1827 to manage his estates and to take a law degree at the University
of Zagreb. Travel in western Europe acquainted him with advanced liberal ideas and
capitalist business practices, which he applied successfully to his own economic interests.
He became a member of Hungary’s upper house in 1830, and in 1845 he led the forces
seeking Hungarian independence from the Habsburg monarchy. Meanwhile, he continued
his business activity and in 1843 headed the sugar industry trust. He went to Vienna in
March 1848 as a member of the committee that presented Hungarian demands for
parliamentary reform to the Austrian imperial court. The following month the Austrian
emperor Ferdinand I (King Ferdinand V of Hungary) appointed Batthyány prime minister
of Hungary’s new parliamentary government, which took office on April 7. Despite his able
leadership and the passing of important social legislation, his government was caught
between the forces of the Austrian monarchy and the extreme separatist Hungarian
elements.
In the ensuing civil war, Batthyány tried to mediate but finally took the side of the
revolutionaries. On October 11 he was wounded in battle, fell from his horse, and broke an
arm. In attempting to negotiate with the Austrian forces, he was captured on Jan. 3, 1849,
and sentenced to death by hanging. The night before the execution Batthyány tried,
unsuccessfully, to kill himself with a knife. The next morning, badly wounded, he was shot
for the crime of sedition. His death caused deep mourning across the nation and aligned
European public opinion against Austria.

Lakhdar Brahimi
Lakhdar Brahimi, (born January 1, 1934, Algeria), Algerian diplomat whose lengthy
career included peacemaking efforts in Lebanon, South Africa, Haiti, Afghanistan, Iraq,
and Syria.
Brahimi was educated in both France and his native Algeria (which was under French rule
at the time of his birth). During Algeria’s struggle for independence from France in the late
1950s and early ’60s, he was a representative of the National Liberation Front (Front de
Libération Nationale), the group that led the liberation struggle, in Southeast Asia.
Continuing in his diplomatic role through the 1970s, he represented independent Algeria in
Egypt, Sudan, and the United Kingdom and to the Arab League. He served in the Algerian
government as presidential adviser (1982–84) and then served as under-secretary-general
(1984–91) of the Arab League before returning to the Algerian government as foreign
minister (1991–93).
In 1992 Brahimi was a rapporteur at the United Nations Conference on Environment and
Development (Earth Summit). He subsequently headed UN missions to South Africa
(1993–94) and Haiti (1994–96) before being appointed to represent the UN in Afghanistan
in 1997. Frustrated with the inability to resolve the conflict between the Taliban and other
factions in Afghanistan, he resigned from his post in 1999. In 2000 he was lauded for his
Report of the Panel on UN Peace Operations (commonly known as the Brahimi Report),
which recommended broad changes to the way UN peacekeeping missions were conceived
and implemented. The report was critical in particular of UN inaction in both Rwanda in
1994, when long-running tensions between that country’s two major ethnic groups—the
Hutu and the Tutsi—led to a genocide in which more than 800,000 civilians (primarily
Tutsi) were killed, and Srebrenica, Bosnia and Herzegovina, in 1995, when at least 7,000
Bosniaks (Muslims) were massacred by Bosnian Serbs. Brahimi again served in
Afghanistan (2001–04), this time to lead UN reconstruction efforts following the U.S.-led
mission that toppled the Taliban regime there in 2001. In 2002 he was honoured by
Harvard University Law School with its annual Great Negotiator Award.
Brahimi was appointed special adviser to the secretary-general of the UN in January 2004.
In May the UN sent Brahimi to Iraq to help that country recover from the U.S. invasion of
2003 (see Iraq War). He was charged with aiding in the effort to restore Iraqi independence,
which hinged on the country’s first democratic elections, scheduled for early 2005.
Keeping in mind Iraq’s ethnic and religious diversity, Brahimi helped build a transitional

government, forming a National Assembly of 100 members and overseeing the June 2004
implementation of the Coalition Provisional Authority and the selection of Ayād ʿAllāwī as
interim Iraqi prime minister. After his departure from Iraq at the end of June, he indicated
his impression that the U.S. invasion in 2003 had caused more problems than it had solved.
He retired from his position as special adviser at the end of 2005. In August 2012 Brahimi
was appointed the UN’s special envoy to Syria. He replaced Kofi Annan, who had resigned
after failing to broker a cease-fire in the Syrian Civil War during his six-month tenure.
Brahimi was also unable to negotiate a peace deal, and he left the post in 2014.
Brahimi was a member of the Elders, a group of international leaders established in the
early 21st century to promote peaceful conflict resolution throughout the world.

Lal Bahadur Shastri, (born October 2, 1904,
Mughalsarai, India—died January 11, 1966, Tashkent,
Uzbekistan, U.S.S.R.), Indian statesman, prime
minister of India (1964–66) after Jawaharlal Nehru.
A member of Mahatma Gandhi’s noncooperation
movement against British government in India, he was imprisoned for a short time (1921).
Upon release he studied in the Kashi Vidyapitha, a nationalist university, where he
graduated with the title of shastri (“learned in the scriptures”). He then returned to politics
as a follower of Gandhi, was imprisoned several more times, and attained influential
positions in the Congress Party of the state of the United Provinces, now Uttar Pradesh
state.
Shastri was elected to the legislature of the United Provinces in 1937 and 1946. After
Indian independence, Shastri gained experience as minister for home affairs and transport
in Uttar Pradesh. He was elected to the central Indian legislature in 1952 and became union
minister for railways and transport. He gained a reputation as a skillful mediator after his
appointment to the influential post of minister for home affairs in 1961. Three years later,
on Jawaharlal Nehru’s illness, Shastri was appointed minister without portfolio, and after
Nehru’s death he became prime minister in June 1964.
Shastri was criticized for failing to deal effectively with India’s economic problems, but he
won great popularity for his firmness on the outbreak of hostilities with neighbouring
Pakistan (1965) over the disputed Kashmir region. He died of a heart attack after signing a
“no-war” agreement with Pres. Ayub Khan of Pakistan and was succeeded as prime
minister by Indira Gandhi, Nehru’s daughter.

Lala Har Dayal
Lala Har Dayal, Har Dayal also spelled Hardayal or Hardyal, (born Oct. 14, 1884,
Delhi, India—died March 4, 1939, Philadelphia, Pa., U.S.), Indian revolutionary and
scholar who was dedicated to the removal of British influence in India.
Har Dayal graduated from the Government College, Lahore (University of the Punjab). On
a Government of India scholarship to St. John’s College at Oxford, he became a supporter
of the Indian revolutionary movement. In 1907 Har Dayal resigned his scholarship. He
returned to India in 1908 to further indigenous political institutions and to arouse his
countrymen against British rule, but the government thwarted his work, and he soon
returned to Europe. He traveled through France and Germany, disseminating anti-British
propaganda and lauding Western science and political philosophy as holding the key to a
successful anticolonial struggle. In 1913 he formed the Ghadr (Gadar) Party to organize a
rebellion against the British government of India. In March 1914 he was arrested by U.S.
immigration authorities. Released on bail, he fled to Switzerland and then to Berlin, where
he tried to foment an anti-British rising in northwestern India.
After the German defeat in World War I, Har Dayal settled in Stockholm as a professor of
Indian philosophy and wrote Forty-Four Months in Germany and Turkey, in which he
related his wartime experiences with some distaste, arguing that if the weaker countries of
Asia could not gain their independence, then British or French rule over them was better
than that of Germany or Japan. In his later years Har Dayal decisively rejected his earlier
revolutionary viewpoint. He abandoned his Anglophobia, advocated the mixed British and
Indian administration of his country, and became a firm admirer of Western culture and
values. He moved to the United States in the late 1920s and became a professor of Sanskrit
at the University of California, Berkeley.

Lala Lajpat Rai
Lala Lajpat Rai, (born 1865, Dhudike, India—died November 17, 1928, Lahore [now in
Pakistan]), Indian writer and politician, outspoken in his advocacy of a militant anti-British
nationalism in the Indian National Congress (Congress Party) and as a leader of the Hindu
supremacy movement.
After studying law at the Government College in Lahore, Lajpat Rai practiced at Hissar
and Lahore, where he helped to establish the nationalistic Dayananda Anglo-Vedic School
and became a follower of Dayananda Sarasvati, the founder of the conservative Hindu
society Arya Samaj (“Society of Aryans”). After joining the Congress Party and taking part
in political agitation in the Punjab, Lajpat Rai was deported to Mandalay, Burma (now
Myanmar), without trial, in May 1907. In November, however, he was allowed to return
when the viceroy, Lord Minto, decided that there was insufficient evidence to hold him for
subversion. Lajpat Rai’s supporters attempted to secure his election to the presidency of the
party session at Surat in December 1907, but elements favouring cooperation with the
British refused to accept him, and the party split over the issues.
During World War I, Lajpat Rai lived in the United States, where he founded the Indian
Home Rule League of America (1917) in New York City. He returned to India in early
1920, and later that year he led a special session of the Congress Party that launched
Mohandas (Mahatma) Gandhi’s noncooperation movement. Imprisoned from 1921 to 1923,
he was elected to the legislative assembly on his release. In 1928 he introduced the
legislative assembly resolution for the boycott of the British Simon Commission on
constitutional reform. Shortly thereafter he died, after being attacked by police during a
demonstration in Lahore.
Lajpat Rai’s most important writings include The Story of My Deportation (1908), Arya
Samaj (1915), The United States of America: A Hindu’s Impression (1916), England’s Debt
to India: A Historical Narrative of Britain’s Fiscal Policy in India (1917), and Unhappy
India (1928).

Lee Kuan Yew
Lee Kuan Yew, (born September 16, 1923, Singapore
—died March 23, 2015, Singapore), politician and
lawyer who was prime minister of Singapore from
1959 to 1990. During his long rule, Singapore became
the most-prosperous country in Southeast Asia.
Lee was born into a Chinese family that had been established in Singapore since the 19th
century. His first language was English, and only upon entering politics did he acquire a
command of Chinese as well as Malay and Tamil. After attending school in Singapore, Lee
briefly enrolled at the London School of Economics and Political Science before earning a
law degree (1949) at Fitzwilliam House, Cambridge. There he headed the honours list. He
also became a socialist. Although he was admitted (1950) to the English bar, he returned to
Singapore. Appointed legal adviser to the Postal Union, he participated in negotiations to
obtain higher wages for postal workers and subsequently did similar work for other trade
unions.
Singapore was a British crown colony and the site of Britain’s principal naval base in East
Asia, which was ruled by a governor assisted by a legislative council. The council’s
members consisted primarily of wealthy Chinese businessmen, most of whom were
appointed rather than elected. When, in the early 1950s, constitutional reform was in the air
in Singapore, Lee formed an alliance with two other political newcomers—David Saul
Marshall, a lawyer, and Lim Yew Hock, a trade unionist—to challenge the hold of the
businessmen on the council. Lee, however, soon broke with his two colleagues to take a
more radical stand, becoming secretary-general of his own party, the People’s Action Party
(PAP). The party included some communists, Lee having accepted communist support for
some years.
In 1955 a new constitution was introduced that increased the number of elected seats on the
council to 25 out of a total of 32. In the elections, the Labour Front, founded by Lee’s
former colleagues, won 13 seats, while the PAP won 3—one of which, for a district
inhabited by many of the poorest Chinese in Singapore, was won by Lee.
The following year Lee returned to London as a member of a Singaporean delegation that
unsuccessfully sought self-rule for the colony. Unrest in Singapore followed, during which
a number of PAP leaders were imprisoned. In 1957 negotiations in London resumed, again

with Lee on the delegation. After agreement was reached on a measure of self-government,
Lee won a by-election in Singapore by an overwhelming majority. A brief power struggle
within the PAP then ensued: in August Lee was ousted from the secretary-generalship by
the party’s left wing, but he regained his post in October.
The next year (1958) in London, Lee helped negotiate the status of a self-governing state
within the Commonwealth for Singapore. Elections were held under Singapore’s new
constitution in May 1959, and Lee campaigned on an anticolonialist, anticommunist
platform calling for social reforms and eventual union with Malaya. Lee’s party won a
decisive victory, gaining 43 of the 51 seats, but Lee refused to form a government until the
British freed the left-wing members of his party who had been imprisoned in 1956. After
their release, Lee was sworn in as prime minister on June 5, 1959, and he formed a cabinet.
He introduced a five-year plan calling for slum clearance and the building of new public
housing, the emancipation of women, the expansion of educational services, and
industrialization. In 1961 the PAP’s left-wing members broke away from the party to form
the Barisan Sosialis (“Socialist Front”), and Lee subsequently broke his remaining ties with
the communists. Henceforth Lee and his fellow moderates within the PAP would dominate
Singaporean politics.
In 1963 Lee took Singapore into the newly created Federation of Malaysia. In elections
held soon afterward, the PAP retained its control of Singapore’s Parliament, and Lee thus
continued as prime minister. In 1964, however, he made the mistake of entering his party,
75 percent of whose members were Chinese, in the Malaysian national elections. The
growing tension between Chinese and Malays resulted in communal rioting in Singapore
itself. In August 1965 Lee was told by his Malaysian colleagues in the federal government
that Singapore must leave the federation. Although Lee passionately believed in the
multiracialism that the federation represented, Singapore had to secede. It then became a
sovereign state with Lee as its first prime minister.
Lee’s principal aims were to ensure the physical survival of the new state and to retain
Singapore’s national identity. Surrounded by more powerful neighbours (including China
and Indonesia), Lee did not press for the immediate withdrawal of Commonwealth forces
from Singapore. Instead, he sought to phase them out slowly and to replace them with a
Singaporean force locally trained and patterned on the Israeli model.
More importantly, Lee recognized that Singapore needed a strong economy in order to
survive as an independent country, and he launched a program to industrialize Singapore

and transform it into a major exporter of finished goods. He encouraged foreign investment
and secured agreements between labour unions and business management that ensured both
labour peace and a rising standard of living for workers. While improving health and social
welfare services, Lee continually emphasized the necessity of cooperation, discipline, and
austerity on the part of the average Singaporean.
Lee’s dominance of the country’s political life was made easier when the main opposition
party, the Barisan Sosialis, decided to boycott Parliament from 1966. As a result, the PAP
won every seat in the chamber in the elections of 1968, 1972, 1976, and 1980, after which
opposition parties managed to claim one or two seats. Lee sometimes resorted to press
censorship to stifle left-wing dissent over his government’s fundamental policies.
Lee brought his country an efficient administration and spectacular prosperity at the cost of
a mildly authoritarian style of government that sometimes infringed on civil liberties. By
the 1980s Singapore under Lee’s guidance had a per capita income second in East Asia
only to Japan’s, and the country had become a chief financial centre of Southeast Asia.
The PAP won the general elections of 1984 and 1988, and Lee remained prime minister,
though the question of the succession of leadership became an issue during that decade.
After satisfactorily arranging the succession, Lee resigned the office of prime minister in
November 1990, though he remained the leader of the PAP until 1992.
Lee’s successor as prime minister, Goh Chok Tong, named Lee to the cabinet position of
senior minister, from which Lee continued to exercise considerable political influence.
Upon Goh’s resignation as prime minister in 2004 (he was succeeded by Lee’s son Lee
Hsien Loong), Goh became senior minister. The elder Lee remained in the cabinet as
“minister mentor,” a position he held until 2011, when he finally stepped down from the
cabinet. He held his seat in Parliament until his death, however, winning reelection in 1991,
1997, 2001, 2006, and 2011.

More importantly, Lee recognized that Singapore needed a strong economy in order to survive as an independent country, and he launched a program to industrialize Singapore  Lee Kuan Yew   and transform it into a major exporter of finished goods. He encouraged foreign investment and secured agreements between labour unions and business management that ensured both labour peace and a rising standard of living for workers. While improving health and social welfare services, Lee continually emphasized the necessity of cooperation, discipline, and austerity on the part of the average Singaporean. Lee’s dominance of the country’s political life was made easier when the main opposition party, the Barisan Sosialis, decided to boycott Parliament from 1966. As a result, the PAP won every seat in the chamber in the elections of 1968, 1972, 1976, and 1980, after which opposition parties managed to claim one or two seats. Lee sometimes resorted to press censorship to stifle left-wing dissent over his government’s fundamental policies. Lee brought his country an efficient administration and spectacular prosperity at the cost of a mildly authoritarian style of government that sometimes infringed on civil liberties. By the 1980s Singapore under Lee’s guidance had a per capita income second in East Asia only to Japan’s, and the country had become a chief financial centre of Southeast Asia. The PAP won the general elections of 1984 and 1988, and Lee remained prime minister, though the question of the succession of leadership became an issue during that decade. After satisfactorily arranging the succession, Lee resigned the office of prime minister in November 1990, though he remained the leader of the PAP until 1992. Lee’s successor as prime minister, Goh Chok Tong, named Lee to the cabinet position of senior minister, from which Lee continued to exercise considerable political influence. Upon Goh’s resignation as prime minister in 2004 (he was succeeded by Lee’s son Lee Hsien Loong), Goh became senior minister. The elder Lee remained in the cabinet as “minister mentor,” a position he held until 2011, when he finally stepped down from the cabinet. He held his seat in Parliament until his death, however, winning reelection in 1991, 1997, 2001, 2006, and 2011.

Levi Eshkol
Levi Eshkol, original name Levi Shkolnik, (born Oct.
25, 1895, Oratov, near Kiev, Ukraine, Russian Empire—
died Feb. 26, 1969, Jerusalem), prime minister of Israel
from 1963 until his death.
Eshkol became involved in the Zionist movement while
a student in Vilna, Lith. He moved to Palestine in 1914 when it was under Ottoman rule,
working there in a number of settlements. He fought as a member of the Jewish Legion on
the side of the British forces against the Ottomans. At the end of his service in 1920,
Eshkol helped found Deganya Bet, one of the first kibbutzim (collective settlements) in
Palestine. Thereafter he worked untiringly for the future Israeli state. He was one of the
founders of Histadrut (General Federation of Labour) and was instrumental during World
War II in the movement of people and goods from Germany to Palestine.
After the State of Israel was established in 1948, Eshkol held several government positions,
including that of minister of finance (1952–63). When in 1963 David Ben-Gurion
announced his retirement as prime minister, Eshkol succeeded him. Two years later Ben-
Gurion again sought the leadership, but Eshkol easily won the election.
The major event of Eshkol’s governance was the Six-Day War (June 1967) against Egypt,
Jordan, and Syria. With the help of such individuals as Golda Meir, Eshkol also unified
Israel’s three major labour parties into the Israel Labour Party.

London, Eng.), Irish rebel who was renowned for his gallantry and courage, who was a
leading conspirator behind the uprising of 1798 against British rule in Ireland.
The son of James Fitzgerald, 1st duke of Leinster, he joined the British army and in 1781
fought against the colonists in the American Revolutionary War. Fitzgerald was first elected
to the Irish Parliament in 1783. His enthusiasm for the French Revolution led to dismissal
from the army in 1792, and four years later he joined the Society of United Irishmen, a
nationalist organization that aspired to free Ireland from English control. This group
appointed him to head the military committee formed to plan an uprising and obtain aid
from the French revolutionary regime. Although the French delayed in supplying arms and
troops, Fitzgerald’s committee went ahead with its plans for a general rebellion. The
insurrection was set for May 23, 1798. In March Fitzgerald’s coconspirators were seized by
government agents. Fitzgerald himself was arrested in Dublin on May 19, after a fierce
struggle during which he was shot in the arm. He died of his wound in prison several weeks
later. The rebellion broke out at the appointed time but was suppressed.

Ly Nam De
Ly Nam De, also called Ly Bon, Ly Ban, Li Bi, or Ly Bi, (born, Giao-chao province,
northern Vietnam—died 549, Laos), founder of the first Vietnamese dynasty mentioned in
extant historical records and Vietnam’s first great champion of independence.
Ly Nam De led a successful revolt against the Chinese governor of Giao-chao province in
542 and captured the capital at Long Bien. Two years later he proclaimed himself emperor
and assumed his royal name. The earliest surviving Vietnamese historical records (13th–
14th century) indicate that he controlled a vast territory, covering most of what is now
northern and central Vietnam, and his authority was recognized throughout the Red River
delta in the north and southward to the frontiers of the Champa kingdom. He named his
newly founded empire Van Xuan, implying that it would last “One Thousand Springs.” The
Chinese regained power, however, defeating Ly Nam De in 547 at the northern village of
Chu Dien. Seeking refuge, Ly Nam De fled to Laos, but he was killed by local tribesmen
who decapitated him and sent his head to the Chinese.
Though short-lived, Ly Nam De’s kingdom formed the nucleus of the future Dai Viet, the
first truly independent Vietnamese state. Shortly thereafter two other Viets attempted to
gain control over Giao-chao: Ly Xuan (589–590) and Ly Phat Tu (late 590s–603). These
three together constitute what has been called the Earlier Ly dynasty to distinguish it from
that established by Ly Thai To in 1009 (the Later Ly dynasty).

Léopold Senghor -- Britannica Online Encyclopedia

Léopold Senghor
Léopold Senghor
Léopold Senghor, in full Léopold Sédar Senghor,
(born Oct. 9, 1906, Joal, Senegal, French West Africa
[now in Senegal]—died Dec. 20, 2001, Verson,
France), poet, teacher, and statesman, first president
of Senegal, and a major proponent of the concept of
Negritude.
Senghor was the son of a prosperous Serer planter and trader. His mother was a Roman
Catholic and sent him to a nearby Catholic mission and seminary in order to fulfill his first
ambition, which was to become a teacher-priest. At age 20 he realized that the priesthood
was not his calling, and he transferred to the lycée (secondary school) in the capital city of
Dakar.
In 1928 Senghor went to Paris on a partial scholarship and continued his formal studies at
the Lycée Louis-le-Grand and at the Sorbonne. During these years Senghor discovered the
unmistakable imprint of African art on modern painting, sculpture, and music, which
confirmed his belief in Africa’s potential contribution to modern culture.
In 1935 Senghor became the first African agrégé, the highest rank of qualified teacher in
the French school system, which allowed him to teach at both the lycée and university
levels. He first taught French in Tours, but eventually he became a professor of African
languages and civilization at the École Nationale de la France d’Outre-Mer. Drafted in
1939 at the beginning of World War II, he was captured in 1940 and spent two years in
Nazi concentration camps, where he wrote some of his finest poems. On his release he
joined the Resistance in France.
After the war Senghor became a member of the French Constituent Assembly. In 1946 he
was sent as one of Senegal’s two deputies to the National Assembly in Paris. Elected on the
Socialist ticket, Senghor founded the Senegalese Democratic Bloc in 1948 and, as that
party’s candidate, was reelected by a wide margin in the 1951 elections for the French
National Assembly. Five years later he became mayor of Thiès, Senegal’s railroad centre,
and was reelected deputy.
The French West African colonies increasingly pressed for independence. When the French
parliament passed (1956) the loi cadre, which gave a large measure of self-government to

2/3
the African territories, Senghor was one of the first to oppose the act, because he felt its
emphasis on territorial rather than federal government would result in the proliferation of
small, unviable states. To counter the act, Senghor helped establish an alliance between
French Equatorial Africa and French West Africa that led to the creation in 1959 of the
short-lived Mali Federation, of which Senegal was a member (along with French Sudan
[Mali], Dahomey [Benin], and Upper Volta [Burkina Faso]). In December 1959 Senghor
made an eloquent appeal to French President Charles de Gaulle for independence. The Mali
Federation lasted only until the following August, when its last two members, Senegal and
French Sudan, separated, Senegal became an independent republic, and Senghor was
unanimously elected president.
In late 1962 Prime Minister Mamadou Dia, a longtime protégé of Senghor, attempted a
coup d’état. The Senegalese people rallied behind Senghor, however, and Dia was
sentenced to life imprisonment (he was released in 1974). Senghor was reelected president
in 1963 and retired on Dec. 31, 1980, the first African president to leave office voluntarily.
Abdou Diouf, whom Senghor had chosen as his successor, became the next president.
As chief executive, Senghor tried to modernize Senegal’s agriculture, instill a sense of
enlightened citizenship, combat corruption and inefficiency, forge closer ties with his
African neighbours, and continue cooperation with the French. He advocated a form of
socialism that was based on African realities and was often called “African socialism.”
Senghor’s socialism was democratic and humanistic, and it shunned such slogans as
“dictatorship of the proletariat.” A vigorous spokesman for the Third World, he protested
unfair terms of trade that worked to the disadvantage of African nations.
Along with Aimé Césaire of Martinique and Léon G. Damas of French Guiana, Senghor
was one of the originators in the 1930s and ’40s of the concept of Negritude, which is often
defined as the literary and artistic expression of the black African experience. Senghor
became Negritude’s foremost spokesman. In 1947 he helped establish the journal Présence
Africaine, which published the works of African writers, and in 1948 he edited an
anthology of French-language poetry by black Africans that became a seminal text of the
Negritude movement. He was also a distinguished poet in his own right whose books
include Chants d’ombre (1945; Songs of Shadow), Hosties noires (1948; Black Offerings),
Éthiopiques (1956), Nocturnes (1961), and Élégies majeures (1979; Major Elegies). His
poetry was collected in Oeuvre poétique (1990; Poetical Work). Senghor was inducted into
the French Academy in 1984, becoming the first African member in that body’s history.

After he left Senegalese politics, he retired to France, where he had been a citizen since
1932. He published a memoir, Ce que je crois: négritude, francité, et civilisation de
l’universel (1988; “That Which I Believe: Negritude, Frenchness, and Universal
Civilization”), as well as more poetry.
Senghor’s career was replete with paradoxes. Although a Roman Catholic and a Serer, he
headed a predominantly Muslim, Wolof nation. An outstanding intellectual, he drew his
main support from the peasants. A fervent supporter of African culture, he also appreciated
the cultural contributions of the West. A distinguished poet, he was in addition a
professional politician of great skill who guided his nation to independence and proved to
be an able and effective leader.

Senghor was the son of a prosperous Serer planter and trader. His mother was a Roman Catholic and sent him to a nearby Catholic mission and seminary in order to fulfill his first ambition, which was to become a teacher-priest. At age 20 he realized that the priesthood was not his calling, and he transferred to the lycée (secondary school) in the capital city of Dakar. In 1928 Senghor went to Paris on a partial scholarship and continued his formal studies at the Lycée Louis-le-Grand and at the Sorbonne. During these years Senghor discovered the unmistakable imprint of African art on modern painting, sculpture, and music, which confirmed his belief in Africa’s potential contribution to modern culture. In 1935 Senghor became the first African agrégé, the highest rank of qualified teacher in the French school system, which allowed him to teach at both the lycée and university levels. He first taught French in Tours, but eventually he became a professor of African languages and civilization at the École Nationale de la France d’Outre-Mer. Drafted in 1939 at the beginning of World War II, he was captured in 1940 and spent two years in Nazi concentration camps, where he wrote some of his finest poems. On his release he joined the Resistance in France. After the war Senghor became a member of the French Constituent Assembly. In 1946 he was sent as one of Senegal’s two deputies to the National Assembly in Paris. Elected on the Socialist ticket, Senghor founded the Senegalese Democratic Bloc in 1948 and, as that party’s candidate, was reelected by a wide margin in the 1951 elections for the French National Assembly. Five years later he became mayor of Thiès, Senegal’s railroad centre, and was reelected deputy. The French West African colonies increasingly pressed for independence.

To counter the act, Senghor helped establish an alliance between French Equatorial Africa and French West Africa that led to the creation in 1959 of the short-lived Mali Federation, of which Senegal was a member (along with French Sudan [Mali], Dahomey [Benin], and Upper Volta [Burkina Faso]). In December 1959 Senghor made an eloquent appeal to French President Charles de Gaulle for independence. The Mali Federation lasted only until the following August, when its last two members, Senegal and French Sudan, separated, Senegal became an independent republic, and Senghor was unanimously elected president. In late 1962 Prime Minister Mamadou Dia, a longtime protégé of Senghor, attempted a coup d’état. The Senegalese people rallied behind Senghor, however, and Dia was sentenced to life imprisonment (he was released in 1974). Senghor was reelected president in 1963 and retired on Dec. 31, 1980, the first African president to leave office voluntarily. Abdou Diouf, whom Senghor had chosen as his successor, became the next president. As chief executive, Senghor tried to modernize Senegal’s agriculture, instill a sense of enlightened citizenship, combat corruption and inefficiency, forge closer ties with his African neighbours, and continue cooperation with the French. He advocated a form of socialism that was based on African realities and was often called “African socialism.” Senghor’s socialism was democratic and humanistic, and it shunned such slogans as “dictatorship of the proletariat.” A vigorous spokesman for the Third World, he protested unfair terms of trade that worked to the disadvantage of African nations.

Mahatma Gandhi
Mahatma Gandhi
Mahatma Gandhi, byname of Mohandas
Karamchand Gandhi, (born October 2, 1869,
Porbandar, India—died January 30, 1948, Delhi),
Indian lawyer, politician, social activist, and writer
who became the leader of the nationalist movement
against the British rule of India. As such, he came to
be considered the father of his country. Gandhi is
internationally esteemed for his doctrine of nonviolent protest (satyagraha) to achieve
political and social progress.
In the eyes of millions of his fellow Indians, Gandhi was the Mahatma (“Great Soul”). The
unthinking adoration of the huge crowds that gathered to see him all along the route of his
tours made them a severe ordeal; he could hardly work during the day or rest at night. “The
woes of the Mahatmas,” he wrote, “are known only to the Mahatmas.” His fame spread
worldwide during his lifetime and only increased after his death. The name Mahatma
Gandhi is now one of the most universally recognized on earth.
Youth
Gandhi was the youngest child of his father’s fourth wife. His father—Karamchand
Gandhi, who was the dewan (chief minister) of Porbandar, the capital of a small
principality in western India (in what is now Gujarat state) under British suzerainty—did
not have much in the way of a formal education. He was, however, an able administrator
who knew how to steer his way between the capricious princes, their long-suffering
subjects, and the headstrong British political officers in power.
Gandhi’s mother, Putlibai, was completely absorbed in religion, did not care much for
finery or jewelry, divided her time between her home and the temple, fasted frequently, and
wore herself out in days and nights of nursing whenever there was sickness in the family.
Mohandas grew up in a home steeped in Vaishnavism—worship of the Hindu god Vishnu
—with a strong tinge of Jainism, a morally rigorous Indian religion whose chief tenets are
nonviolence and the belief that everything in the universe is eternal. Thus, he took for
granted ahimsa (noninjury to all living beings), vegetarianism, fasting for self-purification,
and mutual tolerance between adherents of various creeds and sects.

The educational facilities at Porbandar were rudimentary; in the primary school that
Mohandas attended, the children wrote the alphabet in the dust with their fingers. Luckily
for him, his father became dewan of Rajkot, another princely state. Though Mohandas
occasionally won prizes and scholarships at the local schools, his record was on the whole
mediocre. One of the terminal reports rated him as “good at English, fair in Arithmetic and
weak in Geography; conduct very good, bad handwriting.” He was married at the age of 13
and thus lost a year at school. A diffident child, he shone neither in the classroom nor on
the playing field. He loved to go out on long solitary walks when he was not nursing his by
then ailing father (who died soon thereafter) or helping his mother with her household
chores.
He had learned, in his words, “to carry out the orders of the elders, not to scan them.” With
such extreme passivity, it is not surprising that he should have gone through a phase of
adolescent rebellion, marked by secret atheism, petty thefts, furtive smoking, and—most
shocking of all for a boy born in a Vaishnava family—meat eating. His adolescence was
probably no stormier than that of most children of his age and class. What was
extraordinary was the way his youthful transgressions ended.
“Never again” was his promise to himself after each escapade. And he kept his promise.
Beneath an unprepossessing exterior, he concealed a burning passion for self-improvement
that led him to take even the heroes of Hindu mythology, such as Prahlada and
Harishcandra—legendary embodiments of truthfulness and sacrifice—as living models.
In 1887 Mohandas scraped through the matriculation examination of the University of
Bombay (now University of Mumbai) and joined Samaldas College in Bhavnagar
(Bhaunagar). As he had to suddenly switch from his native language—Gujarati—to
English, he found it rather difficult to follow the lectures.
Meanwhile, his family was debating his future. Left to himself, he would have liked to
have been a doctor. But, besides the Vaishnava prejudice against vivisection, it was clear
that, if he was to keep up the family tradition of holding high office in one of the states in
Gujarat, he would have to qualify as a barrister. That meant a visit to England, and
Mohandas, who was not too happy at Samaldas College, jumped at the proposal. His
youthful imagination conceived England as “a land of philosophers and poets, the very
centre of civilization.” But there were several hurdles to be crossed before the visit to
England could be realized. His father had left the family little property; moreover, his
mother was reluctant to expose her youngest child to unknown temptations and dangers in
1/14/23, 3:51 PM

3/16
a distant land. But Mohandas was determined to visit England. One of his brothers raised
the necessary money, and his mother’s doubts were allayed when he took a vow that, while
away from home, he would not touch wine, women, or meat. Mohandas disregarded the
last obstacle—the decree of the leaders of the Modh Bania subcaste (Vaishya caste), to
which the Gandhis belonged, who forbade his trip to England as a violation of the Hindu
religion—and sailed in September 1888. Ten days after his arrival, he joined the Inner
Temple, one of the four London law colleges (The Temple).
Sojourn in England and return to India
Gandhi took his studies seriously and tried to brush up on his English and Latin by taking
the University of London matriculation examination. But, during the three years he spent in
England, his main preoccupation was with personal and moral issues rather than with
academic ambitions. The transition from the half-rural atmosphere of Rajkot to the
cosmopolitan life of London was not easy for him. As he struggled painfully to adapt
himself to Western food, dress, and etiquette, he felt awkward. His vegetarianism became a
continual source of embarrassment to him; his friends warned him that it would wreck his
studies as well as his health. Fortunately for him he came across a vegetarian restaurant as
well as a book providing a reasoned defense of vegetarianism, which henceforth became a
matter of conviction for him, not merely a legacy of his Vaishnava background. The
missionary zeal he developed for vegetarianism helped to draw the pitifully shy youth out
of his shell and gave him a new poise. He became a member of the executive committee of
the London Vegetarian Society, attending its conferences and contributing articles to its
journal.
In the boardinghouses and vegetarian restaurants of England, Gandhi met not only food
faddists but some earnest men and women to whom he owed his introduction to the Bible
and, more important, the Bhagavadgita, which he read for the first time in its English
translation by Sir Edwin Arnold. The Bhagavadgita (commonly known as the Gita) is part
of the great epic the Mahabharata and, in the form of a philosophical poem, is the most-
popular expression of Hinduism. The English vegetarians were a motley crowd. They
included socialists and humanitarians such as Edward Carpenter, “the British Thoreau”;
Fabians such as George Bernard Shaw; and Theosophists such as Annie Besant. Most of
them were idealists; quite a few were rebels who rejected the prevailing values of the late-
Victorian establishment, denounced the evils of the capitalist and industrial society,
preached the cult of the simple life, and stressed the superiority of moral over material
values and of cooperation over conflict. Those ideas were to contribute substantially to the
shaping of Gandhi’s personality and, eventually, to his politics.

Painful surprises were in store for Gandhi when he returned to India in July 1891. His
mother had died in his absence, and he discovered to his dismay that the barrister’s degree
was not a guarantee of a lucrative career. The legal profession was already beginning to be
overcrowded, and Gandhi was much too diffident to elbow his way into it. In the very first
brief he argued in a court in Bombay (now Mumbai), he cut a sorry figure. Turned down
even for the part-time job of a teacher in a Bombay high school, he returned to Rajkot to
make a modest living by drafting petitions for litigants. Even that employment was closed
to him when he incurred the displeasure of a local British officer. It was, therefore, with
some relief that in 1893 he accepted the none-too-attractive offer of a year’s contract from
an Indian firm in Natal, South Africa.
Years in South Africa
Africa was to present to Gandhi challenges and opportunities that he could hardly have
conceived. In the end he would spend more than two decades there, returning to India only
briefly in 1896–97. The youngest two of his four children were born there.
Emergence as a political and social activist
Gandhi was quickly exposed to the racial discrimination practiced in South Africa. In a
Durban court he was asked by the European magistrate to take off his turban; he refused
and left the courtroom. A few days later, while traveling to Pretoria, he was
unceremoniously thrown out of a first-class railway compartment and left shivering and
brooding at the rail station in Pietermaritzburg. In the further course of that journey, he was
beaten up by the white driver of a stagecoach because he would not travel on the footboard
to make room for a European passenger, and finally he was barred from hotels reserved
“for Europeans only.” Those humiliations were the daily lot of Indian traders and labourers
in Natal, who had learned to pocket them with the same resignation with which they
pocketed their meagre earnings. What was new was not Gandhi’s experience but his
reaction. He had so far not been conspicuous for self-assertion or aggressiveness. But
something happened to him as he smarted under the insults heaped upon him. In retrospect
the journey from Durban to Pretoria struck him as one of the most-creative experiences of
his life; it was his moment of truth. Henceforth he would not accept injustice as part of the
natural or unnatural order in South Africa; he would defend his dignity as an Indian and as
a man.
While in Pretoria, Gandhi studied the conditions in which his fellow South Asians in South
Africa lived and tried to educate them on their rights and duties, but he had no intention of
staying on in South Africa. Indeed, in June 1894, as his year’s contract drew to a close, he
1/14/23, 3:51 PM

https://www.britannica.com/print/article/225216
5/16
was back in Durban, ready to sail for India. At a farewell party given in his honour, he
happened to glance through the Natal Mercury and learned that the Natal Legislative
Assembly was considering a bill to deprive Indians of the right to vote. “This is the first
nail in our coffin,” Gandhi told his hosts. They professed their inability to oppose the bill,
and indeed their ignorance of the politics of the colony, and begged him to take up the fight
on their behalf.
Until the age of 18, Gandhi had hardly ever read a newspaper. Neither as a student in
England nor as a budding barrister in India had he evinced much interest in politics.
Indeed, he was overcome by a terrifying stage fright whenever he stood up to read a speech
at a social gathering or to defend a client in court. Nevertheless, in July 1894, when he was
barely 25, he blossomed almost overnight into a proficient political campaigner. He drafted
petitions to the Natal legislature and the British government and had them signed by
hundreds of his compatriots. He could not prevent the passage of the bill but succeeded in
drawing the attention of the public and the press in Natal, India, and England to the Natal
Indians’ grievances. He was persuaded to settle down in Durban to practice law and to
organize the Indian community. In 1894 he founded the Natal Indian Congress, of which he
himself became the indefatigable secretary. Through that common political organization, he
infused a spirit of solidarity in the heterogeneous Indian community. He flooded the
government, the legislature, and the press with closely reasoned statements of Indian
grievances. Finally, he exposed to the view of the outside world the skeleton in the imperial
cupboard, the discrimination practiced against the Indian subjects of Queen Victoria in one
of her own colonies in Africa. It was a measure of his success as a publicist that such
important newspapers as The Times of London and The Statesman and Englishman of
Calcutta (now Kolkata) editorially commented on the Natal Indians’ grievances.
In 1896 Gandhi went to India to fetch his wife, Kasturba (or Kasturbai), and their two
oldest children and to canvass support for the Indians overseas. He met prominent leaders
and persuaded them to address public meetings in the country’s principal cities.
Unfortunately for him, garbled versions of his activities and utterances reached Natal and
inflamed its European population. On landing at Durban in January 1897, he was assaulted
and nearly lynched by a white mob. Joseph Chamberlain, the colonial secretary in the
British Cabinet, cabled the government of Natal to bring the guilty men to book, but
Gandhi refused to prosecute his assailants. It was, he said, a principle with him not to seek
redress of a personal wrong in a court of law.
Resistance and results

6/16
Gandhi was not the man to nurse a grudge. On the outbreak of the South African (Boer)
War in 1899, he argued that the Indians, who claimed the full rights of citizenship in the
British crown colony of Natal, were in duty bound to defend it. He raised an ambulance
corps of 1,100 volunteers, out of whom 300 were free Indians and the rest indentured
labourers. It was a motley crowd: barristers and accountants, artisans and labourers. It was
Gandhi’s task to instill in them a spirit of service to those whom they regarded as their
oppressors. The editor of the Pretoria News offered an insightful portrait of Gandhi in the
battle zone:
After a night’s work which had shattered men with much bigger frames, I came across Gandhi
in the early morning sitting by the roadside eating a regulation army biscuit. Every man in
[General] Buller’s force was dull and depressed, and damnation was heartily invoked on
everything. But Gandhi was stoical in his bearing, cheerful and confident in his conversation
and had a kindly eye.
The British victory in the war brought little relief to the Indians in South Africa. The new
regime in South Africa was to blossom into a partnership, but only between Boers and
Britons. Gandhi saw that, with the exception of a few Christian missionaries and youthful
idealists, he had been unable to make a perceptible impression upon the South African
Europeans. In 1906 the Transvaal government published a particularly humiliating
ordinance for the registration of its Indian population. The Indians held a mass protest
meeting at Johannesburg in September 1906 and, under Gandhi’s leadership, took a pledge
to defy the ordinance if it became law in the teeth of their opposition and to suffer all the
penalties resulting from their defiance. Thus was born satyagraha (“devotion to truth”), a
new technique for redressing wrongs through inviting, rather than inflicting, suffering, for
resisting adversaries without rancour and fighting them without violence.
The struggle in South Africa lasted for more than seven years. It had its ups and downs, but
under Gandhi’s leadership, the small Indian minority kept up its resistance against heavy
odds. Hundreds of Indians chose to sacrifice their livelihood and liberty rather than submit
to laws repugnant to their conscience and self-respect. In the final phase of the movement
in 1913, hundreds of Indians, including women, went to jail, and thousands of Indian
workers who had struck work in the mines bravely faced imprisonment, flogging, and even
shooting. It was a terrible ordeal for the Indians, but it was also the worst possible
advertisement for the South African government, which, under pressure from the
governments of Britain and India, accepted a compromise negotiated by Gandhi on the one
hand and the South African statesman Gen. Jan Christian Smuts on the other.

“The saint has left our shores,” Smuts wrote to a friend on Gandhi’s departure from South
Africa for India, in July 1914, “I hope for ever.” A quarter century later, he wrote that it had
been his “fate to be the antagonist of a man for whom even then I had the highest respect.”
Once, during his not-infrequent stays in jail, Gandhi had prepared a pair of sandals for
Smuts, who recalled that there was no hatred and personal ill-feeling between them, and
when the fight was over “there was the atmosphere in which a decent peace could be
concluded.”
As later events were to show, Gandhi’s work did not provide an enduring solution for the
Indian problem in South Africa. What he did to South Africa was indeed less important
than what South Africa did to him. It had not treated him kindly, but, by drawing him into
the vortex of its racial problem, it had provided him with the ideal setting in which his
peculiar talents could unfold themselves.
The religious quest
Gandhi’s religious quest dated back to his childhood, the influence of his mother and of his
home life in Porbandar and Rajkot, but it received a great impetus after his arrival in South
Africa. His Quaker friends in Pretoria failed to convert him to Christianity, but they
quickened his appetite for religious studies. He was fascinated by the writings of Leo
Tolstoy on Christianity, read the Qurʾān in translation, and delved into Hindu scriptures and
philosophy. The study of comparative religion, talks with scholars, and his own reading of
theological works brought him to the conclusion that all religions were true and yet every
one of them was imperfect because they were “interpreted with poor intellects, sometimes
with poor hearts, and more often misinterpreted.”
Shrimad Rajchandra, a brilliant young Jain philosopher who became Gandhi’s spiritual
mentor, convinced him of “the subtlety and profundity” of Hinduism, the religion of his
birth. And it was the Bhagavadgita, which Gandhi had first read in London, that became
his “spiritual dictionary” and exercised probably the greatest single influence on his life.
Two Sanskrit words in the Gita particularly fascinated him. One was aparigraha
(“nonpossession”), which implies that people have to jettison the material goods that cramp
the life of the spirit and to shake off the bonds of money and property. The other was
samabhava (“equability”), which enjoins people to remain unruffled by pain or pleasure,
victory or defeat, and to work without hope of success or fear of failure.
Those were not merely counsels of perfection. In the civil case that had taken him to South
Africa in 1893, he had persuaded the antagonists to settle their differences out of court. The

true function of a lawyer seemed to him “to unite parties riven asunder.” He soon regarded
his clients not as purchasers of his services but as friends; they consulted him not only on
legal issues but on such matters as the best way of weaning a baby or balancing the family
budget. When an associate protested that clients came even on Sundays, Gandhi replied: “A
man in distress cannot have Sunday rest.”
Gandhi’s legal earnings reached a peak figure of £5,000 a year, but he had little interest in
moneymaking, and his savings were often sunk in his public activities. In Durban and later
in Johannesburg, he kept an open table; his house was a virtual hostel for younger
colleagues and political coworkers. This was something of an ordeal for his wife, without
whose extraordinary patience, endurance, and self-effacement Gandhi could hardly have
devoted himself to public causes. As he broke through the conventional bonds of family
and property, their life tended to shade into a community life.
Gandhi felt an irresistible attraction to a life of simplicity, manual labour, and austerity. In
1904—after reading John Ruskin’s Unto This Last, a critique of capitalism—he set up a
farm at Phoenix near Durban where he and his friends could live by the sweat of their
brow. Six years later another colony grew up under Gandhi’s fostering care near
Johannesburg; it was named Tolstoy Farm for the Russian writer and moralist, whom
Gandhi admired and corresponded with. Those two settlements were the precursors of the
more-famous ashrams (religious retreats; see ashrama) in India, at Sabarmati near
Ahmedabad (Ahmadabad) and at Sevagram near Wardha.
South Africa had not only prompted Gandhi to evolve a novel technique for political action
but also transformed him into a leader of men by freeing him from bonds that make
cowards of most men. “Persons in power,” the British Classical scholar Gilbert Murray
prophetically wrote about Gandhi in the Hibbert Journal in 1918,
should be very careful how they deal with a man who cares nothing for sensual pleasure,
nothing for riches, nothing for comfort or praise, or promotion, but is simply determined to do
what he believes to be right. He is a dangerous and uncomfortable enemy, because his body
which you can always conquer gives you so little purchase upon his soul.
Return to India
Gandhi decided to leave South Africa in the summer of 1914, just before the outbreak of
World War I. He and his family first went to London, where they remained for several
months. Finally, they departed England in December, arriving in Bombay in early January
1915.

Emergence as nationalist leader
For the next three years, Gandhi seemed to hover uncertainly on the periphery of Indian
politics, declining to join any political agitation, supporting the British war effort, and even
recruiting soldiers for the British Indian Army. At the same time, he did not flinch from
criticizing the British officials for any acts of high-handedness or from taking up the
grievances of the long-suffering peasantry in Bihar and Gujarat. By February 1919,
however, the British had insisted on pushing through—in the teeth of fierce Indian
opposition—the Rowlatt Acts, which empowered the authorities to imprison without trial
those suspected of sedition. A provoked Gandhi finally revealed a sense of estrangement
from the British raj and announced a satyagraha struggle. The result was a virtual political
earthquake that shook the subcontinent in the spring of 1919. The violent outbreaks that
followed—notably the Massacre of Amritsar, which was the killing by British-led soldiers
of nearly 400 Indians who were gathered in an open space in Amritsar in the Punjab region
(now in Punjab state), and the enactment of martial law—prompted him to stay his hand.
However, within a year he was again in a militant mood, having in the meantime been
irrevocably alienated by British insensitiveness to Indian feeling on the Punjab tragedy and
Muslim resentment on the peace terms offered to Turkey following World War I.
By the autumn of 1920, Gandhi was the dominant figure on the political stage,
commanding an influence never before attained by any political leader in India or perhaps
in any other country. He refashioned the 35-year-old Indian National Congress (Congress
Party) into an effective political instrument of Indian nationalism: from a three-day
Christmas-week picnic of the upper middle class in one of the principal cities of India, it
became a mass organization with its roots in small towns and villages. Gandhi’s message
was simple: it was not British guns but imperfections of Indians themselves that kept their
country in bondage. His program, the nonviolent noncooperation movement against the
British government, included boycotts not only of British manufactures but of institutions
operated or aided by the British in India: legislatures, courts, offices, schools. The
campaign electrified the country, broke the spell of fear of foreign rule, and led to the
arrests of thousands of satyagrahis, who defied laws and cheerfully lined up for prison. In
February 1922 the movement seemed to be on the crest of a rising wave, but, alarmed by a
violent outbreak in Chauri Chaura, a remote village in eastern India, Gandhi decided to call
off mass civil disobedience. That was a blow to many of his followers, who feared that his
self-imposed restraints and scruples would reduce the nationalist struggle to pious futility.
Gandhi himself was arrested on March 10, 1922, tried for sedition, and sentenced to six
years’ imprisonment. He was released in February 1924, after undergoing surgery for

appendicitis. The political landscape had changed in his absence. The Congress Party had
split into two factions, one under Chitta Ranjan Das and Motilal Nehru (the father of
Jawaharlal Nehru, India’s first prime minister) favouring the entry of the party into
legislatures and the other under Chakravarti Rajagopalachari and Vallabhbhai Jhaverbhai
Patel opposing it. Worst of all, the unity between Hindus and Muslims of the heyday of the
noncooperation movement of 1920–22 had dissolved. Gandhi tried to draw the warring
communities out of their suspicion and fanaticism by reasoning and persuasion. Finally,
after a serious outbreak of communal unrest, he undertook a three-week fast in the autumn
of 1924 to arouse the people into following the path of nonviolence. In December 1924 he
was named president of the Congress Party, and he served for a year.
Return to party leadership
During the mid-1920s Gandhi took little interest in
active politics and was considered a spent force. In
1927, however, the British government appointed a
constitutional reform commission under Sir John
Simon, a prominent English lawyer and politician,
that did not contain a single Indian. When the
Congress and other parties boycotted the commission,
the political tempo rose. At the Congress session
(meeting) at Calcutta in December 1928, Gandhi put
forth the crucial resolution demanding dominion
status from the British government within a year
under threat of a nationwide nonviolent campaign for
complete independence. Henceforth, Gandhi was back as the leading voice of the Congress
Party. In March 1930 he launched the Salt March, a satyagraha against the British-imposed
tax on salt, which affected the poorest section of the community. One of the most
spectacular and successful campaigns in Gandhi’s nonviolent war against the British raj, it
resulted in the imprisonment of more than 60,000 people. A year later, after talks with the
viceroy, Lord Irwin (later Lord Halifax), Gandhi accepted a truce (the Gandhi-Irwin Pact),
called off civil disobedience, and agreed to attend the Round Table Conference in London
as the sole representative of the Indian National Congress.
The conference, which concentrated on the problem of the Indian minorities rather than on
the transfer of power from the British, was a great disappointment to the Indian
nationalists. Moreover, when Gandhi returned to India in December 1931, he found his

party facing an all-out offensive from Lord Irwin’s successor as viceroy, Lord Willingdon,
who unleashed the sternest repression in the history of the nationalist movement. Gandhi
was once more imprisoned, and the government tried to insulate him from the outside
world and to destroy his influence. That was not an easy task. Gandhi soon regained the
initiative. In September 1932, while still a prisoner, he embarked on a fast to protest against
the British government’s decision to segregate the so-called “untouchables” (the lowest
level of the Indian caste system; now called Scheduled Castes [official] or Dalits) by
allotting them separate electorates in the new constitution. The fast produced an emotional
upheaval in the country, and an alternative electoral arrangement was jointly and speedily
devised by the leaders of the Hindu community and the Dalits and endorsed by the British
government (see Poona Pact). The fast became the starting point of a vigorous campaign
for the removal of the disenfranchisement of the Dalits, whom Gandhi referred to as
Harijans, or “children of God.”
In 1934 Gandhi resigned not only as the leader but
also as a member of the Congress Party. He had come
to believe that its leading members had adopted
nonviolence as a political expedient and not as the
fundamental creed it was for him. In place of political
activity he then concentrated on his “constructive
programme” of building the nation “from the bottom
up”—educating rural India, which accounted for 85 percent of the population; continuing
his fight against untouchability; promoting hand spinning, weaving, and other cottage
industries to supplement the earnings of the underemployed peasantry; and evolving a
system of education best suited to the needs of the people. Gandhi himself went to live at
Sevagram, a village in central India, which became the centre of his program of social and
economic uplift.
The last phase
With the outbreak of World War II, the nationalist
struggle in India entered its last crucial phase. Gandhi
hated fascism and all it stood for, but he also hated
war. The Indian National Congress, on the other hand,
was not committed to pacifism and was prepared to
support the British war effort if Indian self-
government was assured. Once more Gandhi became

politically active. The failure of the mission of Sir Stafford Cripps, a British cabinet
minister who went to India in March 1942 with an offer that Gandhi found unacceptable,
the British equivocation on the transfer of power to Indian hands, and the encouragement
given by high British officials to conservative and communal forces promoting discord
between Muslims and Hindus impelled Gandhi to demand in the summer of 1942 an
immediate British withdrawal from India—what became known as the Quit India
Movement.
In mid-1942 the war against the Axis powers,
particularly Japan, was in a critical phase, and the
British reacted sharply to the campaign. They
imprisoned the entire Congress leadership and set out
to crush the party once and for all. There were violent
outbreaks that were sternly suppressed, and the gulf
between Britain and India became wider than ever
before. Gandhi, his wife, and several other top party
leaders (including Nehru) were confined in the Aga Khan Palace (now the Gandhi National
Memorial) in Poona (now Pune). Kasturba died there in early 1944, shortly before Gandhi
and the others were released.
A new chapter in Indo-British relations opened with the victory of the Labour Party in
Britain 1945. During the next two years, there were prolonged triangular negotiations
between leaders of the Congress, the Muslim League under Mohammed Ali Jinnah, and the
British government, culminating in the Mountbatten Plan of June 3, 1947, and the
formation of the two new dominions of India and Pakistan in mid-August 1947.
It was one of the greatest disappointments of Gandhi’s life that Indian freedom was realized
without Indian unity. Muslim separatism had received a great boost while Gandhi and his
colleagues were in jail, and in 1946–47, as the final constitutional arrangements were being
negotiated, the outbreak of communal riots between Hindus and Muslims unhappily
created a climate in which Gandhi’s appeals to reason and justice, tolerance and trust had
little chance. When partition of the subcontinent was accepted—against his advice—he
threw himself heart and soul into the task of healing the scars of the communal conflict,
toured the riot-torn areas in Bengal and Bihar, admonished the bigots, consoled the victims,
and tried to rehabilitate the refugees. In the atmosphere of that period, surcharged with
suspicion and hatred, that was a difficult and heartbreaking task. Gandhi was blamed by
partisans of both the communities. When persuasion failed, he went on a fast. He won at

least two spectacular triumphs: in September 1947 his fasting stopped the rioting in
Calcutta, and in January 1948 he shamed the city of Delhi into a communal truce. A few
days later, on January 30, while he was on his way to his evening prayer meeting in Delhi,
he was shot down by Nathuram Godse, a young Hindu fanatic.
Place in history
The British attitude toward Gandhi was one of
mingled admiration, amusement, bewilderment,
suspicion, and resentment. Except for a tiny minority
of Christian missionaries and radical socialists, the
British tended to see him at best as a utopian
visionary and at worst as a cunning hypocrite whose
professions of friendship for the British race were a
mask for subversion of the British raj. Gandhi was
conscious of the existence of that wall of prejudice, and it was part of the strategy of
satyagraha to penetrate it.
His three major campaigns in 1920–22, 1930–34, and 1940–42 were well designed to
engender that process of self-doubt and questioning that was to undermine the moral
defenses of his adversaries and to contribute, together with the objective realities of the
postwar world, to producing the grant of dominion status in 1947. The British abdication in
India was the first step in the liquidation of the British Empire on the continents of Asia
and Africa. Gandhi’s image as a rebel and enemy died hard, but, as it had done to the
memory of George Washington, Britain, in 1969, the centenary year of Gandhi’s birth,
erected a statue to his memory.
Gandhi had critics in his own country and indeed in his own party. The liberal leaders
protested that he was going too fast; the young radicals complained that he was not going
fast enough; left-wing politicians alleged that he was not serious about evicting the British
or liquidating such vested Indian interests as princes and landlords; the leaders of the Dalits
doubted his good faith as a social reformer; and Muslim leaders accused him of partiality to
his own community.
Research in the second half of the 20th century established Gandhi’s role as a great
mediator and reconciler. His talents in that direction were applied to conflicts between the
older moderate politicians and the young radicals, the political terrorists and the
parliamentarians, the urban intelligentsia and the rural masses, the traditionalists and the

modernists, the caste Hindus and the Dalits, the Hindus and the Muslims, and the Indians
and the British.
It was inevitable that Gandhi’s role as a political leader should loom larger in the public
imagination, but the mainspring of his life lay in religion, not in politics. And religion for
him did not mean formalism, dogma, ritual, or sectarianism. “What I have been striving
and pining to achieve these thirty years,” he wrote in his autobiography, “is to see God face
to face.” His deepest strivings were spiritual, but unlike many of his fellow Indians with
such aspirations, he did not retire to a cave in the Himalayas to meditate on the Absolute;
he carried his cave, as he once said, within him. For him truth was not something to be
discovered in the privacy of one’s personal life; it had to be upheld in the challenging
contexts of social and political life.
Gandhi won the affection and loyalty of gifted men and women, old and young, with vastly
dissimilar talents and temperaments; of Europeans of every religious persuasion; and of
Indians of almost every political line. Few of his political colleagues went all the way with
him and accepted nonviolence as a creed; fewer still shared his food fads, his interest in
mudpacks and nature cure, or his prescription of brahmacarya, complete renunciation of
the pleasures of the flesh.
Gandhi’s ideas on sex may now sound quaint and unscientific. His marriage at the age of
13 seems to have complicated his attitude toward sex and charged it with feelings of guilt,
but it is important to remember that total sublimation, according to one tradition of Hindu
thought, is indispensable for those who seek self-realization, and brahmacarya was for
Gandhi part of a larger discipline in food, sleep, thought, prayer, and daily activity designed
to equip himself for service of the causes to which he was totally committed. What he
failed to see was that his own unique experience was no guide for the common man.
Scholars have continued to judge Gandhi’s place in
history. He was the catalyst if not the initiator of three
of the major revolutions of the 20th century: the
movements against colonialism, racism, and violence.
He wrote copiously; the collected edition of his
writings had reached 100 volumes by the early 21st
century.
Much of what he wrote was in response to the needs of his coworkers and disciples and the
exigencies of the political situation, but on fundamentals he maintained a remarkable
1/14/23, 3:51 PM

consistency, as is evident from the Hind Swaraj (“Indian Home Rule”), published in South
Africa in 1909. The strictures on Western materialism and colonialism, the reservations
about industrialism and urbanization, the distrust of the modern state, and the total rejection
of violence that was expressed in that book seemed romantic, if not reactionary, to the pre-
World War I generation in India and the West, which had not known the shocks of two
global wars or experienced the phenomenon of Adolf Hitler and the trauma of the atom
bomb. Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru’s objective of promoting a just and egalitarian
order at home and nonalignment with military blocs abroad doubtless owed much to
Gandhi, but neither he nor his colleagues in the Indian nationalist movement wholly
accepted the Gandhian models in politics and economics.
In the years since Gandhi’s death, his name has been invoked by the organizers of
numerous demonstrations and movements. However, with a few outstanding exceptions—
such as those of his disciple the land reformer Vinoba Bhave in India and of the civil rights
leader Martin Luther King, Jr., in the United States—those movements have been a travesty
of the ideas of Gandhi.
Yet Gandhi will probably never lack champions. Erik H. Erikson, a distinguished American
psychoanalyst, in his study of Gandhi senses “an affinity between Gandhi’s truth and the
insights of modern psychology.” One of the greatest admirers of Gandhi was Albert
Einstein, who saw in Gandhi’s nonviolence a possible antidote to the massive violence
unleashed by the fission of the atom. And Gunnar Myrdal, the Swedish economist, after his
survey of the socioeconomic problems of the underdeveloped world, pronounced Gandhi
“in practically all fields an enlightened liberal.” In a time of deepening crisis in the
underdeveloped world, of social malaise in the affluent societies, of the shadow of
unbridled technology and the precarious peace of nuclear terror, it seems likely that
Gandhi’s ideas and techniques will become increasingly relevant.

As such, he came to be considered the father of his country. Gandhi is internationally esteemed for his doctrine of nonviolent protest (satyagraha) to achieve political and social progress. In the eyes of millions of his fellow Indians, Gandhi was the Mahatma (“Great Soul”). The unthinking adoration of the huge crowds that gathered to see him all along the route of his tours made them a severe ordeal; he could hardly work during the day or rest at night. “The woes of the Mahatmas,” he wrote, “are known only to the Mahatmas.” His fame spread worldwide during his lifetime and only increased after his death. The name Mahatma Gandhi is now one of the most universally recognized on earth. Youth Gandhi was the youngest child of his father’s fourth wife. His father—Karamchand Gandhi, who was the dewan (chief minister) of Porbandar, the capital of a small principality in western India (in what is now Gujarat state) under British suzerainty—did not have much in the way of a formal education. He was, however, an able administrator who knew how to steer his way between the capricious princes, their long-suffering subjects, and the headstrong British political officers in power. Gandhi’s mother, Putlibai, was completely absorbed in religion, did not care much for finery or jewelry, divided her time between her home and the temple, fasted frequently, and wore herself out in days and nights of nursing whenever there was sickness in the family. Mohandas grew up in a home steeped in Vaishnavism—worship of the Hindu god Vishnu —with a strong tinge of Jainism, a morally rigorous Indian religion whose chief tenets are nonviolence and the belief that everything in the universe is eternal. Thus, he took for granted ahimsa (noninjury to all living beings), vegetarianism, fasting for self-purification, and mutual tolerance between adherents of various creeds and sects. Mahatma Gandhi   The educational facilities at Porbandar were rudimentary; in the primary school that Mohandas attended, the children wrote the alphabet in the dust with their fingers. Luckily for him, his father became dewan of Rajkot, another princely state. Though Mohandas occasionally won prizes and scholarships at the local schools, his record was on the whole mediocre. One of the terminal reports rated him as “good at English, fair in Arithmetic and weak in Geography; conduct very good, bad handwriting.” He was married at the age of 13 and thus lost a year at school. A diffident child, he shone neither in the classroom nor on the playing field. He loved to go out on long solitary walks when he was not nursing his by then ailing father (who died soon thereafter) or helping his mother with her household chores. He had learned, in his words, “to carry out the orders of the elders, not to scan them.” With such extreme passivity, it is not surprising that he should have gone through a phase of adolescent rebellion, marked by secret atheism, petty thefts, furtive smoking, and—most shocking of all for a boy born in a Vaishnava family—meat eating. His adolescence was probably no stormier than that of most children of his age and class. What was extraordinary was the way his youthful transgressions ended. “Never again” was his promise to himself after each escapade. And he kept his promise. Beneath an unprepossessing exterior, he concealed a burning passion for self-improvement that led him to take even the heroes of Hindu mythology, such as Prahlada and Harishcandra—legendary embodiments of truthfulness and sacrifice—as living models. In 1887 Mohandas scraped through the matriculation examination of the University of Bombay (now University of Mumbai) and joined Samaldas College in Bhavnagar (Bhaunagar). As he had to suddenly switch from his native language—Gujarati—to English, he found it rather difficult to follow the lectures. Meanwhile, his family was debating his future. Left to himself, he would have liked to have been a doctor. But, besides the Vaishnava prejudice against vivisection, it was clear that, if he was to keep up the family tradition of holding high office in one of the states in Gujarat, he would have to qualify as a barrister. That meant a visit to England, and Mohandas, who was not too happy at Samaldas College, jumped at the proposal. His youthful imagination conceived England as “a land of philosophers and poets, the very centre of civilization.” But there were several hurdles to be crossed before the visit to England could be realized. His father had left the family little property; moreover, his mother was reluctant to expose her youngest child to unknown temptations and dangers in  Mahatma Gandhi   a distant land. But Mohandas was determined to visit England. One of his brothers raised the necessary money, and his mother’s doubts were allayed when he took a vow that, while away from home, he would not touch wine, women, or meat. Mohandas disregarded the last obstacle—the decree of the leaders of the Modh Bania subcaste (Vaishya caste), to which the Gandhis belonged, who forbade his trip to England as a violation of the Hindu religion—and sailed in September 1888. Ten days after his arrival, he joined the Inner Temple, one of the four London law colleges (The Temple). Sojourn in England and return to India Gandhi took his studies seriously and tried to brush up on his English and Latin by taking the University of London matriculation examination. But, during the three years he spent in England, his main preoccupation was with personal and moral issues rather than with academic ambitions. The transition from the half-rural atmosphere of Rajkot to the cosmopolitan life of London was not easy for him. As he struggled painfully to adapt himself to Western food, dress, and etiquette, he felt awkward. His vegetarianism became a continual source of embarrassment to him; his friends warned him that it would wreck his studies as well as his health. Fortunately for him he came across a vegetarian restaurant as well as a book providing a reasoned defense of vegetarianism, which henceforth became a matter of conviction for him, not merely a legacy of his Vaishnava background. The missionary zeal he developed for vegetarianism helped to draw the pitifully shy youth out of his shell and gave him a new poise. He became a member of the executive committee of the London Vegetarian Society, attending its conferences and contributing articles to its journal. In the boardinghouses and vegetarian restaurants of England, Gandhi met not only food faddists but some earnest men and women to whom he owed his introduction to the Bible and, more important, the Bhagavadgita, which he read for the first time in its English translation by Sir Edwin Arnold. The Bhagavadgita (commonly known as the Gita) is part of the great epic the Mahabharata and, in the form of a philosophical poem, is the most- popular expression of Hinduism. The English vegetarians were a motley crowd. They included socialists and humanitarians such as Edward Carpenter, “the British Thoreau”; Fabians such as George Bernard Shaw; and Theosophists such as Annie Besant. Most of them were idealists; quite a few were rebels who rejected the prevailing values of the late- Victorian establishment, denounced the evils of the capitalist and industrial society, preached the cult of the simple life, and stressed the superiority of moral over material values and of cooperation over conflict. Those ideas were to contribute substantially to the shaping of Gandhi’s personality and, eventually, to his politics. Mahatma Gandhi   Painful surprises were in store for Gandhi when he returned to India in July 1891. His mother had died in his absence, and he discovered to his dismay that the barrister’s degree was not a guarantee of a lucrative career. The legal profession was already beginning to be overcrowded, and Gandhi was much too diffident to elbow his way into it. In the very first brief he argued in a court in Bombay (now Mumbai), he cut a sorry figure. Turned down even for the part-time job of a teacher in a Bombay high school, he returned to Rajkot to make a modest living by drafting petitions for litigants. Even that employment was closed to him when he incurred the displeasure of a local British officer. It was, therefore, with some relief that in 1893 he accepted the none-too-attractive offer of a year’s contract from an Indian firm in Natal, South Africa. Years in South Africa Africa was to present to Gandhi challenges and opportunities that he could hardly have conceived. In the end he would spend more than two decades there, returning to India only briefly in 1896–97. The youngest two of his four children were born there. Emergence as a political and social activist Gandhi was quickly exposed to the racial discrimination practiced in South Africa. In a Durban court he was asked by the European magistrate to take off his turban; he refused and left the courtroom. A few days later, while traveling to Pretoria, he was unceremoniously thrown out of a first-class railway compartment and left shivering and brooding at the rail station in Pietermaritzburg. In the further course of that journey, he was beaten up by the white driver of a stagecoach because he would not travel on the footboard to make room for a European passenger, and finally he was barred from hotels reserved “for Europeans only.” Those humiliations were the daily lot of Indian traders and labourers in Natal, who had learned to pocket them with the same resignation with which they pocketed their meagre earnings. What was new was not Gandhi’s experience but his reaction. He had so far not been conspicuous for self-assertion or aggressiveness. But something happened to him as he smarted under the insults heaped upon him. In retrospect the journey from Durban to Pretoria struck him as one of the most-creative experiences of his life; it was his moment of truth. Henceforth he would not accept injustice as part of the natural or unnatural order in South Africa; he would defend his dignity as an Indian and as a man. While in Pretoria, Gandhi studied the conditions in which his fellow South Asians in South Africa lived and tried to educate them on their rights and duties, but he had no intention of staying on in South Africa. Indeed, in June 1894, as his year’s contract drew to a close, he  Mahatma Gandhi   was back in Durban, ready to sail for India. At a farewell party given in his honour, he happened to glance through the Natal Mercury and learned that the Natal Legislative Assembly was considering a bill to deprive Indians of the right to vote. “This is the first nail in our coffin,” Gandhi told his hosts. They professed their inability to oppose the bill, and indeed their ignorance of the politics of the colony, and begged him to take up the fight on their behalf. Until the age of 18, Gandhi had hardly ever read a newspaper. Neither as a student in England nor as a budding barrister in India had he evinced much interest in politics. Indeed, he was overcome by a terrifying stage fright whenever he stood up to read a speech at a social gathering or to defend a client in court. Nevertheless, in July 1894, when he was barely 25, he blossomed almost overnight into a proficient political campaigner. He drafted petitions to the Natal legislature and the British government and had them signed by hundreds of his compatriots. He could not prevent the passage of the bill but succeeded in drawing the attention of the public and the press in Natal, India, and England to the Natal Indians’ grievances. He was persuaded to settle down in Durban to practice law and to organize the Indian community. In 1894 he founded the Natal Indian Congress, of which he himself became the indefatigable secretary. Through that common political organization, he infused a spirit of solidarity in the heterogeneous Indian community. He flooded the government, the legislature, and the press with closely reasoned statements of Indian grievances. Finally, he exposed to the view of the outside world the skeleton in the imperial cupboard, the discrimination practiced against the Indian subjects of Queen Victoria in one of her own colonies in Africa. It was a measure of his success as a publicist that such important newspapers as The Times of London and The Statesman and Englishman of Calcutta (now Kolkata) editorially commented on the Natal Indians’ grievances. In 1896 Gandhi went to India to fetch his wife, Kasturba (or Kasturbai), and their two oldest children and to canvass support for the Indians overseas. He met prominent leaders and persuaded them to address public meetings in the country’s principal cities. Unfortunately for him, garbled versions of his activities and utterances reached Natal and inflamed its European population. On landing at Durban in January 1897, he was assaulted and nearly lynched by a white mob. Joseph Chamberlain, the colonial secretary in the British Cabinet, cabled the government of Natal to bring the guilty men to book, but Gandhi refused to prosecute his assailants. It was, he said, a principle with him not to seek redress of a personal wrong in a court of law. Resistance and results  Mahatma Gandhi   Gandhi was not the man to nurse a grudge. On the outbreak of the South African (Boer) War in 1899, he argued that the Indians, who claimed the full rights of citizenship in the British crown colony of Natal, were in duty bound to defend it. He raised an ambulance corps of 1,100 volunteers, out of whom 300 were free Indians and the rest indentured labourers. It was a motley crowd: barristers and accountants, artisans and labourers. It was Gandhi’s task to instill in them a spirit of service to those whom they regarded as their oppressors. The editor of the Pretoria News offered an insightful portrait of Gandhi in the battle zone: After a night’s work which had shattered men with much bigger frames, I came across Gandhi in the early morning sitting by the roadside eating a regulation army biscuit. Every man in [General] Buller’s force was dull and depressed, and damnation was heartily invoked on everything. But Gandhi was stoical in his bearing, cheerful and confident in his conversation and had a kindly eye. The British victory in the war brought little relief to the Indians in South Africa. The new regime in South Africa was to blossom into a partnership, but only between Boers and Britons. Gandhi saw that, with the exception of a few Christian missionaries and youthful idealists, he had been unable to make a perceptible impression upon the South African Europeans. In 1906 the Transvaal government published a particularly humiliating ordinance for the registration of its Indian population. The Indians held a mass protest meeting at Johannesburg in September 1906 and, under Gandhi’s leadership, took a pledge to defy the ordinance if it became law in the teeth of their opposition and to suffer all the penalties resulting from their defiance. Thus was born satyagraha (“devotion to truth”), a new technique for redressing wrongs through inviting, rather than inflicting, suffering, for resisting adversaries without rancour and fighting them without violence. The struggle in South Africa lasted for more than seven years. It had its ups and downs, but under Gandhi’s leadership, the small Indian minority kept up its resistance against heavy odds. Hundreds of Indians chose to sacrifice their livelihood and liberty rather than submit to laws repugnant to their conscience and self-respect. In the final phase of the movement in 1913, hundreds of Indians, including women, went to jail, and thousands of Indian workers who had struck work in the mines bravely faced imprisonment, flogging, and even shooting. It was a terrible ordeal for the Indians, but it was also the worst possible advertisement for the South African government, which, under pressure from the governments of Britain and India, accepted a compromise negotiated by Gandhi on the one hand and the South African statesman Gen. Jan Christian Smuts on the other. Mahatma Gandhi   “The saint has left our shores,” Smuts wrote to a friend on Gandhi’s departure from South Africa for India, in July 1914, “I hope for ever.” A quarter century later, he wrote that it had been his “fate to be the antagonist of a man for whom even then I had the highest respect.” Once, during his not-infrequent stays in jail, Gandhi had prepared a pair of sandals for Smuts, who recalled that there was no hatred and personal ill-feeling between them, and when the fight was over “there was the atmosphere in which a decent peace could be concluded.” As later events were to show, Gandhi’s work did not provide an enduring solution for the Indian problem in South Africa. What he did to South Africa was indeed less important than what South Africa did to him. It had not treated him kindly, but, by drawing him into the vortex of its racial problem, it had provided him with the ideal setting in which his peculiar talents could unfold themselves. The religious quest Gandhi’s religious quest dated back to his childhood, the influence of his mother and of his home life in Porbandar and Rajkot, but it received a great impetus after his arrival in South Africa. His Quaker friends in Pretoria failed to convert him to Christianity, but they quickened his appetite for religious studies. He was fascinated by the writings of Leo Tolstoy on Christianity, read the Qurʾān in translation, and delved into Hindu scriptures and philosophy. The study of comparative religion, talks with scholars, and his own reading of theological works brought him to the conclusion that all religions were true and yet every one of them was imperfect because they were “interpreted with poor intellects, sometimes with poor hearts, and more often misinterpreted.” Shrimad Rajchandra, a brilliant young Jain philosopher who became Gandhi’s spiritual mentor, convinced him of “the subtlety and profundity” of Hinduism, the religion of his birth. And it was the Bhagavadgita, which Gandhi had first read in London, that became his “spiritual dictionary” and exercised probably the greatest single influence on his life. Two Sanskrit words in the Gita particularly fascinated him. One was aparigraha (“nonpossession”), which implies that people have to jettison the material goods that cramp the life of the spirit and to shake off the bonds of money and property. The other was samabhava (“equability”), which enjoins people to remain unruffled by pain or pleasure, victory or defeat, and to work without hope of success or fear of failure. Those were not merely counsels of perfection. In the civil case that had taken him to South Africa in 1893, he had persuaded the antagonists to settle their differences out of court. The  Mahatma Gandhi   true function of a lawyer seemed to him “to unite parties riven asunder.” He soon regarded his clients not as purchasers of his services but as friends; they consulted him not only on legal issues but on such matters as the best way of weaning a baby or balancing the family budget. When an associate protested that clients came even on Sundays, Gandhi replied: “A man in distress cannot have Sunday rest.” Gandhi’s legal earnings reached a peak figure of £5,000 a year, but he had little interest in moneymaking, and his savings were often sunk in his public activities. In Durban and later in Johannesburg, he kept an open table; his house was a virtual hostel for younger colleagues and political coworkers. This was something of an ordeal for his wife, without whose extraordinary patience, endurance, and self-effacement Gandhi could hardly have devoted himself to public causes. As he broke through the conventional bonds of family and property, their life tended to shade into a community life. Gandhi felt an irresistible attraction to a life of simplicity, manual labour, and austerity. In 1904—after reading John Ruskin’s Unto This Last, a critique of capitalism—he set up a farm at Phoenix near Durban where he and his friends could live by the sweat of their brow. Six years later another colony grew up under Gandhi’s fostering care near Johannesburg; it was named Tolstoy Farm for the Russian writer and moralist, whom Gandhi admired and corresponded with. Those two settlements were the precursors of the more-famous ashrams (religious retreats; see ashrama) in India, at Sabarmati near Ahmedabad (Ahmadabad) and at Sevagram near Wardha. South Africa had not only prompted Gandhi to evolve a novel technique for political action but also transformed him into a leader of men by freeing him from bonds that make cowards of most men. “Persons in power,” the British Classical scholar Gilbert Murray prophetically wrote about Gandhi in the Hibbert Journal in 1918, should be very careful how they deal with a man who cares nothing for sensual pleasure, nothing for riches, nothing for comfort or praise, or promotion, but is simply determined to do what he believes to be right. He is a dangerous and uncomfortable enemy, because his body which you can always conquer gives you so little purchase upon his soul. Return to India Gandhi decided to leave South Africa in the summer of 1914, just before the outbreak of World War I. He and his family first went to London, where they remained for several months. Finally, they departed England in December, arriving in Bombay in early January 1915. Mahatma Gandhi   Emergence as nationalist leader For the next three years, Gandhi seemed to hover uncertainly on the periphery of Indian politics, declining to join any political agitation, supporting the British war effort, and even recruiting soldiers for the British Indian Army. At the same time, he did not flinch from criticizing the British officials for any acts of high-handedness or from taking up the grievances of the long-suffering peasantry in Bihar and Gujarat. By February 1919, however, the British had insisted on pushing through—in the teeth of fierce Indian opposition—the Rowlatt Acts, which empowered the authorities to imprison without trial those suspected of sedition. A provoked Gandhi finally revealed a sense of estrangement from the British raj and announced a satyagraha struggle. The result was a virtual political earthquake that shook the subcontinent in the spring of 1919. The violent outbreaks that followed—notably the Massacre of Amritsar, which was the killing by British-led soldiers of nearly 400 Indians who were gathered in an open space in Amritsar in the Punjab region (now in Punjab state), and the enactment of martial law—prompted him to stay his hand. However, within a year he was again in a militant mood, having in the meantime been irrevocably alienated by British insensitiveness to Indian feeling on the Punjab tragedy and Muslim resentment on the peace terms offered to Turkey following World War I. By the autumn of 1920, Gandhi was the dominant figure on the political stage, commanding an influence never before attained by any political leader in India or perhaps in any other country. He refashioned the 35-year-old Indian National Congress (Congress Party) into an effective political instrument of Indian nationalism: from a three-day Christmas-week picnic of the upper middle class in one of the principal cities of India, it became a mass organization with its roots in small towns and villages. Gandhi’s message was simple: it was not British guns but imperfections of Indians themselves that kept their country in bondage. His program, the nonviolent noncooperation movement against the British government, included boycotts not only of British manufactures but of institutions operated or aided by the British in India: legislatures, courts, offices, schools. The campaign electrified the country, broke the spell of fear of foreign rule, and led to the arrests of thousands of satyagrahis, who defied laws and cheerfully lined up for prison. In February 1922 the movement seemed to be on the crest of a rising wave, but, alarmed by a violent outbreak in Chauri Chaura, a remote village in eastern India, Gandhi decided to call off mass civil disobedience. That was a blow to many of his followers, who feared that his self-imposed restraints and scruples would reduce the nationalist struggle to pious futility. Gandhi himself was arrested on March 10, 1922, tried for sedition, and sentenced to six years’ imprisonment. He was released in February 1924, after undergoing surgery for  Mahatma Gandhi   Mohandas Gandhi and Sarojini Naidu Round Table Conference appendicitis. The political landscape had changed in his absence. The Congress Party had split into two factions, one under Chitta Ranjan Das and Motilal Nehru (the father of Jawaharlal Nehru, India’s first prime minister) favouring the entry of the party into legislatures and the other under Chakravarti Rajagopalachari and Vallabhbhai Jhaverbhai Patel opposing it. Worst of all, the unity between Hindus and Muslims of the heyday of the noncooperation movement of 1920–22 had dissolved. Gandhi tried to draw the warring communities out of their suspicion and fanaticism by reasoning and persuasion. Finally, after a serious outbreak of communal unrest, he undertook a three-week fast in the autumn of 1924 to arouse the people into following the path of nonviolence. In December 1924 he was named president of the Congress Party, and he served for a year. Return to party leadership During the mid-1920s Gandhi took little interest in active politics and was considered a spent force. In 1927, however, the British government appointed a constitutional reform commission under Sir John Simon, a prominent English lawyer and politician, that did not contain a single Indian. When the Congress and other parties boycotted the commission, the political tempo rose. At the Congress session (meeting) at Calcutta in December 1928, Gandhi put forth the crucial resolution demanding dominion status from the British government within a year under threat of a nationwide nonviolent campaign for complete independence. Henceforth, Gandhi was back as the leading voice of the Congress Party. In March 1930 he launched the Salt March, a satyagraha against the British-imposed tax on salt, which affected the poorest section of the community. One of the most spectacular and successful campaigns in Gandhi’s nonviolent war against the British raj, it resulted in the imprisonment of more than 60,000 people. A year later, after talks with the viceroy, Lord Irwin (later Lord Halifax), Gandhi accepted a truce (the Gandhi-Irwin Pact), called off civil disobedience, and agreed to attend the Round Table Conference in London as the sole representative of the Indian National Congress. The conference, which concentrated on the problem of the Indian minorities rather than on the transfer of power from the British, was a great disappointment to the Indian nationalists. Moreover, when Gandhi returned to India in December 1931, he found his  Mahatma Gandhi   Mohandas K. Gandhi Mohandas K. Gandhi party facing an all-out offensive from Lord Irwin’s successor as viceroy, Lord Willingdon, who unleashed the sternest repression in the history of the nationalist movement. Gandhi was once more imprisoned, and the government tried to insulate him from the outside world and to destroy his influence. That was not an easy task. Gandhi soon regained the initiative. In September 1932, while still a prisoner, he embarked on a fast to protest against the British government’s decision to segregate the so-called “untouchables” (the lowest level of the Indian caste system; now called Scheduled Castes [official] or Dalits) by allotting them separate electorates in the new constitution. The fast produced an emotional upheaval in the country, and an alternative electoral arrangement was jointly and speedily devised by the leaders of the Hindu community and the Dalits and endorsed by the British government (see Poona Pact). The fast became the starting point of a vigorous campaign for the removal of the disenfranchisement of the Dalits, whom Gandhi referred to as Harijans, or “children of God.” In 1934 Gandhi resigned not only as the leader but also as a member of the Congress Party. He had come to believe that its leading members had adopted nonviolence as a political expedient and not as the fundamental creed it was for him. In place of political activity he then concentrated on his “constructive programme” of building the nation “from the bottom up”—educating rural India, which accounted for 85 percent of the population; continuing his fight against untouchability; promoting hand spinning, weaving, and other cottage industries to supplement the earnings of the underemployed peasantry; and evolving a system of education best suited to the needs of the people. Gandhi himself went to live at Sevagram, a village in central India, which became the centre of his program of social and economic uplift. The last phase With the outbreak of World War II, the nationalist struggle in India entered its last crucial phase. Gandhi hated fascism and all it stood for, but he also hated war. The Indian National Congress, on the other hand, was not committed to pacifism and was prepared to support the British war effort if Indian self- government was assured. Once more Gandhi became  Mahatma Gandhi   Aga Khan Palace (Gandhi National Memorial) politically active. The failure of the mission of Sir Stafford Cripps, a British cabinet minister who went to India in March 1942 with an offer that Gandhi found unacceptable, the British equivocation on the transfer of power to Indian hands, and the encouragement given by high British officials to conservative and communal forces promoting discord between Muslims and Hindus impelled Gandhi to demand in the summer of 1942 an immediate British withdrawal from India—what became known as the Quit India Movement. In mid-1942 the war against the Axis powers, particularly Japan, was in a critical phase, and the British reacted sharply to the campaign. They imprisoned the entire Congress leadership and set out to crush the party once and for all. There were violent outbreaks that were sternly suppressed, and the gulf between Britain and India became wider than ever before. Gandhi, his wife, and several other top party leaders (including Nehru) were confined in the Aga Khan Palace (now the Gandhi National Memorial) in Poona (now Pune). Kasturba died there in early 1944, shortly before Gandhi and the others were released. A new chapter in Indo-British relations opened with the victory of the Labour Party in Britain 1945. During the next two years, there were prolonged triangular negotiations between leaders of the Congress, the Muslim League under Mohammed Ali Jinnah, and the British government, culminating in the Mountbatten Plan of June 3, 1947, and the formation of the two new dominions of India and Pakistan in mid-August 1947. It was one of the greatest disappointments of Gandhi’s life that Indian freedom was realized without Indian unity. Muslim separatism had received a great boost while Gandhi and his colleagues were in jail, and in 1946–47, as the final constitutional arrangements were being negotiated, the outbreak of communal riots between Hindus and Muslims unhappily created a climate in which Gandhi’s appeals to reason and justice, tolerance and trust had little chance. When partition of the subcontinent was accepted—against his advice—he threw himself heart and soul into the task of healing the scars of the communal conflict, toured the riot-torn areas in Bengal and Bihar, admonished the bigots, consoled the victims, and tried to rehabilitate the refugees. In the atmosphere of that period, surcharged with suspicion and hatred, that was a difficult and heartbreaking task. Gandhi was blamed by partisans of both the communities. When persuasion failed, he went on a fast. He won at  Mahatma Gandhi   Pune, Maharasthra, India: Gandhi Memorial Stone least two spectacular triumphs: in September 1947 his fasting stopped the rioting in Calcutta, and in January 1948 he shamed the city of Delhi into a communal truce. A few days later, on January 30, while he was on his way to his evening prayer meeting in Delhi, he was shot down by Nathuram Godse, a young Hindu fanatic. Place in history The British attitude toward Gandhi was one of mingled admiration, amusement, bewilderment, suspicion, and resentment. Except for a tiny minority of Christian missionaries and radical socialists, the British tended to see him at best as a utopian visionary and at worst as a cunning hypocrite whose professions of friendship for the British race were a mask for subversion of the British raj. Gandhi was conscious of the existence of that wall of prejudice, and it was part of the strategy of satyagraha to penetrate it. His three major campaigns in 1920–22, 1930–34, and 1940–42 were well designed to engender that process of self-doubt and questioning that was to undermine the moral defenses of his adversaries and to contribute, together with the objective realities of the postwar world, to producing the grant of dominion status in 1947. The British abdication in India was the first step in the liquidation of the British Empire on the continents of Asia and Africa. Gandhi’s image as a rebel and enemy died hard, but, as it had done to the memory of George Washington, Britain, in 1969, the centenary year of Gandhi’s birth, erected a statue to his memory. Gandhi had critics in his own country and indeed in his own party. The liberal leaders protested that he was going too fast; the young radicals complained that he was not going fast enough; left-wing politicians alleged that he was not serious about evicting the British or liquidating such vested Indian interests as princes and landlords; the leaders of the Dalits doubted his good faith as a social reformer; and Muslim leaders accused him of partiality to his own community. Research in the second half of the 20th century established Gandhi’s role as a great mediator and reconciler. His talents in that direction were applied to conflicts between the older moderate politicians and the young radicals, the political terrorists and the parliamentarians, the urban intelligentsia and the rural masses, the traditionalists and the  Mahatma Gandhi   Mohandas (Mahatma) Gandhi: postage stamp modernists, the caste Hindus and the Dalits, the Hindus and the Muslims, and the Indians and the British. It was inevitable that Gandhi’s role as a political leader should loom larger in the public imagination, but the mainspring of his life lay in religion, not in politics. And religion for him did not mean formalism, dogma, ritual, or sectarianism. “What I have been striving and pining to achieve these thirty years,” he wrote in his autobiography, “is to see God face to face.” His deepest strivings were spiritual, but unlike many of his fellow Indians with such aspirations, he did not retire to a cave in the Himalayas to meditate on the Absolute; he carried his cave, as he once said, within him. For him truth was not something to be discovered in the privacy of one’s personal life; it had to be upheld in the challenging contexts of social and political life. Gandhi won the affection and loyalty of gifted men and women, old and young, with vastly dissimilar talents and temperaments; of Europeans of every religious persuasion; and of Indians of almost every political line. Few of his political colleagues went all the way with him and accepted nonviolence as a creed; fewer still shared his food fads, his interest in mudpacks and nature cure, or his prescription of brahmacarya, complete renunciation of the pleasures of the flesh. Gandhi’s ideas on sex may now sound quaint and unscientific. His marriage at the age of 13 seems to have complicated his attitude toward sex and charged it with feelings of guilt, but it is important to remember that total sublimation, according to one tradition of Hindu thought, is indispensable for those who seek self-realization, and brahmacarya was for Gandhi part of a larger discipline in food, sleep, thought, prayer, and daily activity designed to equip himself for service of the causes to which he was totally committed. What he failed to see was that his own unique experience was no guide for the common man. Scholars have continued to judge Gandhi’s place in history. He was the catalyst if not the initiator of three of the major revolutions of the 20th century: the movements against colonialism, racism, and violence. He wrote copiously; the collected edition of his writings had reached 100 volumes by the early 21st century. Much of what he wrote was in response to the needs of his coworkers and disciples and the exigencies of the political situation, but on fundamentals he maintained a remarkable  Mahatma Gandhi   consistency, as is evident from the Hind Swaraj (“Indian Home Rule”), published in South Africa in 1909. The strictures on Western materialism and colonialism, the reservations about industrialism and urbanization, the distrust of the modern state, and the total rejection of violence that was expressed in that book seemed romantic, if not reactionary, to the pre- World War I generation in India and the West, which had not known the shocks of two global wars or experienced the phenomenon of Adolf Hitler and the trauma of the atom bomb. Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru’s objective of promoting a just and egalitarian order at home and nonalignment with military blocs abroad doubtless owed much to Gandhi, but neither he nor his colleagues in the Indian nationalist movement wholly accepted the Gandhian models in politics and economics. In the years since Gandhi’s death, his name has been invoked by the organizers of numerous demonstrations and movements. However, with a few outstanding exceptions— such as those of his disciple the land reformer Vinoba Bhave in India and of the civil rights leader Martin Luther King, Jr., in the United States—those movements have been a travesty of the ideas of Gandhi. Yet Gandhi will probably never lack champions. Erik H. Erikson, a distinguished American psychoanalyst, in his study of Gandhi senses “an affinity between Gandhi’s truth and the insights of modern psychology.” One of the greatest admirers of Gandhi was Albert Einstein, who saw in Gandhi’s nonviolence a possible antidote to the massive violence unleashed by the fission of the atom. And Gunnar Myrdal, the Swedish economist, after his survey of the socioeconomic problems of the underdeveloped world, pronounced Gandhi “in practically all fields an enlightened liberal.” In a time of deepening crisis in the underdeveloped world, of social malaise in the affluent societies, of the shadow of unbridled technology and the precarious peace of nuclear terror, it seems likely that Gandhi’s ideas and techniques will become increasingly relevant.

Makarios III
Makarios III, original name Mikhail Khristodolou
Mouskos, (born August 13, 1913, Pano Panayia,
Paphos, Cyprus—died August 3, 1977, Nicosia),
archbishop and primate of the Orthodox Church of
Cyprus. He was a leader in the struggle for enosis
(union) with Greece during the postwar British
occupation, and, from 1959 until his death in 1977, he was the president of independent
Cyprus.
Mouskos, the son of a poor shepherd, studied in Cyprus and at the University of Athens and
later at the School of Theology of Boston University. He was ordained in 1946, became
bishop of Kition (Larnaca) in 1948, and on October 18, 1950, was made archbishop.
During that time Makarios became identified with the movement for enosis, the archbishop
of Cyprus having traditionally played an important political role during the Turkish
occupation as ethnarch, or head of the Greek Christian community. Opposing the British
government’s proposals for independence or Commonwealth status, as well as Turkish
pressures for partition in order to safeguard the island’s sizable Turkish population,
Makarios met with the Greek prime minister, Alexandros Papagos, in February 1954 and
gained Greek support for enosis. The British soon suspected him of being a leading figure
in the EOKA, an armed nationalist movement led by Col. Georgios Grivas. Makarios,
however, preferred political bargaining to force and negotiated with the British governor in
1955–56. When these talks proved fruitless and Makarios was arrested for sedition in
March 1956 and exiled to the Seychelles, the EOKA intensified its violent campaign. In
March 1957 Makarios was released from detention in exile; not immediately permitted to
return to the country, however, Makarios traveled to Athens before his arrival in Cyprus the
following year. In February 1959 Makarios accepted a compromise that resulted in
independence for Cyprus. He was elected president of the new republic on December 13,
1959, with a Turkish vice president.
Makarios’s administration was marred by fighting between Greeks and Turks, particularly
after December 1963, and the active intervention of both Greece and Turkey. Previously a
champion of exclusively Greek interests, he now worked for integration of the two
communities, measures the Turks repeatedly resisted. In December 1967 he was obliged to
accept a Turkish Cypriot Provisional Administration, which managed Turkish minority

affairs outside the jurisdiction of the central government. Despite communal strife, he was
elected president for a second term in February 1968. Talks between the two communities
remained deadlocked over the question of local autonomy. In 1972 and 1973 other Cypriot
bishops called for Makarios to resign, but he was returned unopposed for a third term as
head of state in 1973.
In July 1974 the Greek Cypriot National Guard, whose officers were mainland Greeks,
attempted a coup, planned by the ruling military junta in Athens, to achieve enosis.
Makarios fled to Malta and then to London, and Turkey invaded Cyprus and proclaimed a
separate state for Turkish Cypriots in the north. Makarios, vowing to resist partition of the
island, returned to Cyprus in December, after the fall of the mainland Greek military junta.

He was a leader in the struggle for enosis (union) with Greece during the postwar British occupation, and, from 1959 until his death in 1977, he was the president of independent Cyprus. Mouskos, the son of a poor shepherd, studied in Cyprus and at the University of Athens and later at the School of Theology of Boston University. He was ordained in 1946, became bishop of Kition (Larnaca) in 1948, and on October 18, 1950, was made archbishop. During that time Makarios became identified with the movement for enosis, the archbishop of Cyprus having traditionally played an important political role during the Turkish occupation as ethnarch, or head of the Greek Christian community. Opposing the British government’s proposals for independence or Commonwealth status, as well as Turkish pressures for partition in order to safeguard the island’s sizable Turkish population, Makarios met with the Greek prime minister, Alexandros Papagos, in February 1954 and gained Greek support for enosis. The British soon suspected him of being a leading figure in the EOKA, an armed nationalist movement led by Col. Georgios Grivas. Makarios, however, preferred political bargaining to force and negotiated with the British governor in 1955–56. When these talks proved fruitless and Makarios was arrested for sedition in March 1956 and exiled to the Seychelles, the EOKA intensified its violent campaign. In March 1957 Makarios was released from detention in exile; not immediately permitted to return to the country, however, Makarios traveled to Athens before his arrival in Cyprus the following year. In February 1959 Makarios accepted a compromise that resulted in independence for Cyprus. He was elected president of the new republic on December 13, 1959, with a Turkish vice president. Makarios’s administration was marred by fighting between Greeks and Turks, particularly after December 1963, and the active intervention of both Greece and Turkey. Previously a champion of exclusively Greek interests, he now worked for integration of the two communities, measures the Turks repeatedly resisted. In December 1967 he was obliged to accept a Turkish Cypriot Provisional Administration, which managed Turkish minority  Makarios III   affairs outside the jurisdiction of the central government. Despite communal strife, he was elected president for a second term in February 1968. Talks between the two communities remained deadlocked over the question of local autonomy. In 1972 and 1973 other Cypriot bishops called for Makarios to resign, but he was returned unopposed for a third term as head of state in 1973. In July 1974 the Greek Cypriot National Guard, whose officers were mainland Greeks, attempted a coup, planned by the ruling military junta in Athens, to achieve enosis. Makarios fled to Malta and then to London, and Turkey invaded Cyprus and proclaimed a separate state for Turkish Cypriots in the north. Makarios, vowing to resist partition of the island, returned to Cyprus in December, after the fall of the mainland Greek military junta.

Manabendra Nath Roy, original name
Narendranath Bhattacharya, (born February 22?,
1887, Arbelia, India—died January 25, 1954, Dehra
Dun), leader of India’s communists until the
independence of India in 1947.
His interest in social and political issues eventually
led to involvement with various Indian groups engaged in trying to overthrow British
colonial rule by acts of terrorism. In 1915 he became involved in a plot by Bengal
revolutionaries to smuggle arms into India. The plot failed, and he vainly searched for the
needed arms among various countries of East and Southeast Asia. In 1916 he reached San
Francisco, Calif., where he changed his name to Manabendra Nath Roy.
Moving to Mexico, Roy helped found the Mexican Communist Party soon after the
Bolshevik Revolution in Russia. In Moscow he made a favourable impression on Russian
communist leader Vladimir Ilich Lenin and was put on the executive committee of the
Communist International (Comintern). Breaking with the Comintern in 1929 over the
policies of Soviet leader Joseph Stalin, Roy tried to return secretly to India but was arrested
by the British and imprisoned. He was released a few years later and joined the Indian
National Congress. Giving higher immediate priority to the defeat of fascism than to Indian
independence, Roy opposed the Congress in its reluctance to aid the British in World War
II. After India gained independence in 1947, Roy abandoned communism and became a
founder of radical humanism, a mixture of socialist and liberal humanitarian ideas.

Manfredo Fanti
Manfredo Fanti, (born Feb. 23, 1808, Carpi, Kingdom of Italy—died April 5, 1865,
Florence), one of the most capable patriot generals during the mid-19th-century wars of
Italian independence; he helped the northern Italian house of Sardinia–Piedmont
consolidate Italy under its leadership.
Exiled for participating in a republican uprising in Savoy (1831), Fanti distinguished
himself for several years fighting for the liberals in France and in Spain. He returned to
Milan in 1848 to fight the Austrians, but the Sardinia–Piedmont forces were defeated
despite his tactical genius. King Charles Albert of Sardinia reopened the war and was again
decisively beaten at Novara (March 1849). Fanti, suspected of being too ardent a
revolutionary by his Piedmontese superiors, was removed from command but later cleared.
While fighting Austria again in 1859, Fanti scored brilliant victories at Palestro, Magenta,
and San Martino. After the Peace of Villafranca, he organized the army of the Central
Italian League, which included Tuscany, Modena, Parma, and Romagna. When central Italy
was annexed by Piedmont, Fanti became minister of war (January 1860). After the invasion
of Sicily (May 1860) by the revolutionary force of Giuseppe Garibaldi, King Victor
Emmanuel II of Sardinia–Piedmont sent Fanti south. He won impressive victories in the
papal lands. The King took command as the Italians entered Neapolitan territory, where
Fanti scored further successes. In reforming the Italian army, Fanti opposed concessions to
Garibaldi and his volunteers—a position that made Fanti unpopular and led to his
resignation in June 1861, but in April 1862 he accepted command of an army corps in
Florence.

Manuel Belgrano
Manuel Belgrano, (born June 3, 1770, Buenos Aires,
Viceroyalty of Río de la Plata [now in Argentina]—
died June 20, 1820, Buenos Aires), military leader in
the Argentine war for independence.
After studying law in Spain, Belgrano was appointed
secretary of the Buenos Aires official merchants’
guild (1794), a position in which he advocated liberal ideas, particularly in education and
economic reform. He received his first military experience during the unsuccessful British
invasion of the Viceroyalty of Río de la Plata in 1806–07. When Río de la Plata broke with
Spain in 1810, Belgrano became a member of its ruling junta that tried to maintain its
territorial integrity. In 1812 he decreed the adoption of what was to become Argentina’s
national flag. After outlying portions of the country were lost, Belgrano was sent with a
small army to bring what is now Paraguay under the authority of the junta but was
unsuccessful. He later defeated pro-Spanish forces at Tucumán and Salta in the Argentine
northwest, only to be defeated in Upper Peru (now Bolivia) in 1813. He was superseded in
1814 by José de San Martín as commander of the army.
Belgrano, like many other leaders of the South American independence movement,
favoured the establishment of a monarchical type of government. To find a ruler, he went to
Europe with Bernardino Rivadavia, who later became the first president of the Argentine
republic. The European mission was unsuccessful.

Manuel Ceferino Oribe, (born August 27, 1792,
Montevideo, Río de la Plata [now in Uruguay]—died
November 12, 1857, Montevideo), second president
of Uruguay (1835–38), a member of the Treinta y
Tres Orientales, the legendary 33 nationalists who
successfully fought for Uruguayan independence in
the Cisplatine War (1825–28).
Although he had been allied with José Fructuoso Rivera, the first president of Uruguay,
their ambitions eventually clashed. As president, Oribe sought to extend government
control over rural districts ruled by Rivera. Angered by this challenge and by accusations of
financial mismanagement during his term in office, Rivera rose in revolt in 1836,
eventually forcing Oribe’s resignation in October 1838. Oribe then emigrated to Buenos
Aires along with his supporters and was given a military commission by Argentine dictator
Juan Manuel de Rosas. In 1842 he defeated Rivera’s army with Argentine troops, returned
to Uruguay, and laid siege to Montevideo for nine years (1843–51). This civil strife divided
the nation into rival factions named Blanco (White) and Colorado (Red), led by Oribe and
Rivera, respectively. These two main parties, with the Blancos representing the
conservative rural population and the Colorados representing the liberals, have dominated
Uruguayan politics to the present day. From 1853 to 1855 Oribe was forced into exile in
Europe by the Colorados, who feared his return to the military leadership of the Blancos.
Eight more years of civil strife, complicated by Brazilian and Argentinian interference,
followed Oribe’s death before the Colorados were finally able to establish their control,
ruling almost continuously for nearly a century thereafter.

Manuel Quezon
Manuel Quezon
Manuel Quezon, in full Manuel Luis Quezon y
Molina, (born August 19, 1878, Baler, Philippines—
died August 1, 1944, Saranac Lake, New York, U.S.),
Filipino statesman, leader of the independence
movement, and first president of the Philippine
Commonwealth established under U.S. tutelage in
1935.
Quezon was the son of a schoolteacher and small landholder of Tagalog descent on the
island of Luzon. He cut short his law studies at the University of Santo Tomás in Manila in
1899 to participate in the struggle for independence against the United States, led by
Emilio Aguinaldo. After Aguinaldo surrendered in 1901, however, Quezon returned to the
university, obtained his degree (1903), and practiced law for a few years. Convinced that
the only way to independence was through cooperation with the United States, he ran for
governor of Tayabas province in 1905. Once elected, he served for two years before being
elected a representative in 1907 to the newly established Philippine Assembly.
In 1909 Quezon was appointed resident commissioner for the Philippines, entitled to speak,
but not vote, in the U.S. House of Representatives; during his years in Washington, D.C.,
he fought vigorously for a speedy grant of independence by the United States. Quezon
played a major role in obtaining Congress’ passage in 1916 of the Jones Act, which pledged
independence for the Philippines without giving a specific date when it would take effect.
The act gave the Philippines greater autonomy and provided for the creation of a bicameral
national legislature modeled after the U.S. Congress. Quezon resigned as commissioner
and returned to Manila to be elected to the newly formed Philippine Senate in 1916; he
subsequently served as its president until 1935. In 1922 he gained control of the
Nacionalista Party, which had previously been led by his rival Sergio Osmeña.
Quezon fought for passage of the Tydings–McDuffie Act (1934), which provided for full
independence for the Philippines 10 years after the creation of a constitution and the
establishment of a Commonwealth government that would be the forerunner of an
independent republic. Quezon was elected president of the newly formulated
Commonwealth on September 17, 1935. As president he reorganized the islands’ military
defense (aided by U.S. Gen. Douglas MacArthur as his special adviser), tackled the huge
problem of landless peasants in the countryside who still worked as tenants on large

estates, promoted the settlement and development of the large southern island of Mindanao,
and fought graft and corruption in the government. A new national capital, later known as
Quezon City, was built in a suburb of Manila.
Quezon was reelected president in 1941. After Japan
invaded and occupied the Philippines in 1942, he
went to the United States, where he formed a
government in exile, served as a member of the
Pacific War Council, signed the declaration of the
United Nations against the fascist nations, and wrote
his autobiography, The Good Fight (1946). Quezon
died of tuberculosis before full Philippine independence was established.

Quezon was the son of a schoolteacher and small landholder of Tagalog descent on the island of Luzon. He cut short his law studies at the University of Santo Tomás in Manila in 1899 to participate in the struggle for independence against the United States, led by Emilio Aguinaldo. After Aguinaldo surrendered in 1901, however, Quezon returned to the university, obtained his degree (1903), and practiced law for a few years. Convinced that the only way to independence was through cooperation with the United States, he ran for governor of Tayabas province in 1905. Once elected, he served for two years before being elected a representative in 1907 to the newly established Philippine Assembly. In 1909 Quezon was appointed resident commissioner for the Philippines, entitled to speak, but not vote, in the U.S. House of Representatives; during his years in Washington, D.C., he fought vigorously for a speedy grant of independence by the United States. Quezon played a major role in obtaining Congress’ passage in 1916 of the Jones Act, which pledged independence for the Philippines without giving a specific date when it would take effect. The act gave the Philippines greater autonomy and provided for the creation of a bicameral national legislature modeled after the U.S. Congress. Quezon resigned as commissioner and returned to Manila to be elected to the newly formed Philippine Senate in 1916; he subsequently served as its president until 1935. In 1922 he gained control of the Nacionalista Party, which had previously been led by his rival Sergio Osmeña. Quezon fought for passage of the Tydings–McDuffie Act (1934), which provided for full independence for the Philippines 10 years after the creation of a constitution and the establishment of a Commonwealth government that would be the forerunner of an independent republic. Quezon was elected president of the newly formulated Commonwealth on September 17, 1935. As president he reorganized the islands’ military defense (aided by U.S. Gen. Douglas MacArthur as his special adviser), tackled the huge problem of landless peasants in the countryside who still worked as tenants on large  Manuel Quezon   Manuel Quezon estates, promoted the settlement and development of the large southern island of Mindanao, and fought graft and corruption in the government. A new national capital, later known as Quezon City, was built in a suburb of Manila. Quezon was reelected president in 1941. After Japan invaded and occupied the Philippines in 1942, he went to the United States, where he formed a government in exile, served as a member of the Pacific War Council, signed the declaration of the United Nations against the fascist nations, and wrote his autobiography, The Good Fight (1946). Quezon died of tuberculosis before full Philippine independence was established. The Editors of Encyclopaedia BritannicaThis article was most recently revised and updated by Michael Ray.",

Marian Langiewicz, in full Marian Melchior
Langiewicz, (born August 5, 1827, Krotoszyn, near
Poznań, Poland, Prussia—died May 11, 1887,
Constantinople, Ottoman Empire [now Istanbul,
Turkey]), Polish soldier and patriot who played a key
role in the Polish insurrection of 1863.
After a year in the Prussian army as a lieutenant of artillery, Langiewicz took a teaching
position at the Polish military school in Paris (1860), but in the same year he joined
Garibaldi’s Neapolitan campaign. In 1861 he taught at a short-lived Polish military school
in Cuneo, in the Piedmont region of Italy.
Langiewicz joined in plans for a Polish insurrection against Russia in 1862, and, when it
began in 1863, he headed a ragtag army in the Sandomierz (Sandomir) region of southern
Poland. Because of Langiewicz’s early successes against Russian forces, conservative
elements in the insurrection offered him dictatorship of the revolutionary regime in March,
bypassing and hoping to check the more radical leadership in Warsaw. Langiewicz
accepted the post and won partial recognition from the outmaneuvered Warsaw leaders.
Within a few days, however, his forces suffered serious defeats against the Russians,
which, along with factionalism among his troops, caused him to flee to Austria on March
21; his dictatorship thus ended after 10 days.
Langiewicz was imprisoned by the Austrians until 1865 and then lived in Switzerland for a
while. Later he entered the service of the Ottoman Empire as Langie Bey. He wrote
Relacya o kampanii własney 1863 r. (1905; “Report on My Campaign of 1863”) and Pisma
wojskowe (1920; “Military Writings”).

Mariano Moreno
Mariano Moreno, (born Sept. 3, 1778, Buenos Aires,
viceroyalty of the Rió de la Plata [now in Argentina]
—died 1811, at sea), patriot who was the intellectual
and political leader of Argentina’s movement for
independence.
After practicing law in Buenos Aires and holding several posts in the Spanish colonial
bureaucracy, Moreno came to public attention in September 1809 with his tract
Representación de los hacendados (“Landowners’ Petition”). His argument attacking the
restrictive Spanish Navigation Acts and urging that Argentines be free to trade with other
nations induced concessions by the viceroy two months later.
In May 1810 a provisional junta replaced the Spanish officials in Buenos Aires, and
Moreno became its secretary of military and political affairs. His ability and energy soon
made him the leader of the junta. Among the decisions in which he was prominent were
those to exile the viceroy and to take aggressive action to extend the revolution from
Buenos Aires into the provinces. He also founded the national library and established and
edited the government newspaper, La Gaceta de Buenos Aires. Moreno led in advocating
complete separation from Spain, a course too radical for some members of the junta.
(Independence was not declared until 1816.) Conservative opposition to him grew and
finally forced his resignation at the end of 1810. He accepted a diplomatic mission to Brazil
and Great Britain but died at sea on his way to London.

Markos Botsaris
Markos Botsaris, Italian Marco Bozzari, (born c. 1788, Soúli, Ottoman Empire [now in
Greece]—died Aug. 21, 1823, Karpenisíon), an important leader early in the Greek War of
Independence.
Botsaris’ early years were spent in the struggle between the Souliots of southern Epirus
(Modern Greek: Íperos) and Ali Paşa, who had made himself ruler of Ioánnina (Janina) in
Epirus in 1788. After Ali Paşa succeeded in capturing the Souliot strongholds in 1803,
Botsaris and most of his surviving clansmen fled to Corfu (Kérkyra). He remained there for
16 years, serving in an Albanian regiment under French command. Strongly influenced by
the European ideas of national independence and identity, he joined the patriotic society
Philikí Etaireía in 1814.
Botsaris returned to Epirus with the Souliots in 1820 to join his former enemy Ali Paşa of
Ioánnina in his revolt against the Turkish government and, after Ali Paşa was defeated,
committed the Souliots to the Greek struggle for independence that had broken out in April
1821. After serving in the successful defense of the town of Missolonghi (Mesolóngion)
during the first siege in 1822–23, he led a band of a few hundred Souliot guerrillas on the
night of Aug. 21, 1823, in a bold attack on 4,000 Albanians encamped at Karpenisíon.
The Albanians, who formed the vanguard of a Turkish army advancing to join the siege,
were routed, but Botsaris, who had proved to be one of the most promising commanders of
the Greek forces, was killed. When Botsaris died, his command of the Souliots passed to
his friend Lord Byron, who formed 50 of them into a personal bodyguard at Missolonghi.

Massimo Taparelli, marquis d’Azeglio
Massimo Taparelli, marquis d’Azeglio, (born Oct. 24, 1798, Turin, Piedmont [Italy]—
died Jan. 15, 1866, Turin), aristocrat, painter, author, and statesman who was a leader of the
movement that advocated an Italian national revival (Risorgimento) by the expulsion of all
foreign influences from the then-divided Italian states. His political influence far
outweighed his artistic achievements.
After spending his youth dedicated to painting (1820–30 at Rome), d’Azeglio wrote two
obscurely political novels, Ettore Fieramosca (1833) and Niccolò de’Lapi (1841). These
marked him as a relatively moderate leader of the Risorgimento. His chief work, Gli ultimi
casi de Romagna (1846; “The Last Chances for Romagna”), is a trenchant political critique
of the papal government of Romagna; it demanded that its populace renounce local revolts
and show confidence in the Piedmontese king of Sardinia, Charles Albert, who would head
a liberal Italian federation.
D’Azeglio fought against the Austrians in the Italian liberation movement of 1848. When
Charles Albert, defeated by the Austrians first at Custoza (1848) and then at Novara (1849),
abdicated to his son Victor Emmanuel II, d’Azeglio was named prime minister of
Piedmont-Sardinia on May 7, 1849. His most important piece of legislation, the Siccardi
laws of 1851, abolished ecclesiastical courts and immunities. He also invited Camillo
Benso, Count di Cavour, then a rising young politician, to enter the ministry in 1850.
D’Azeglio resigned on Oct. 30, 1852, because of a disagreement with Cavour, who had
become his finance minister. He retired from public life and served only in minor political
roles thereafter. During his last years he wrote his memoirs, I miei ricordi (“My Memoirs”),
unfinished and published posthumously in 1867.

from 1977 to 1983. Begin was the corecipient, with
Egyptian Pres. Anwar el-Sādāt, of the 1978 Nobel Prize
for Peace for their achievement of a peace treaty between Israel and Egypt that was
formally signed in 1979.
Begin received a law degree from the University of Warsaw in 1935. Active in the Zionist
movement throughout the 1930s, he became (1938) the leader of the Polish branch of the
Betar youth movement, dedicated to the establishment of a Jewish state on both sides of the

parents and a brother died in concentration camps. The Soviet authorities deported Begin to
Siberia in 1940, but in 1941 he was released and joined the Polish army in exile, with
which he went to Palestine in 1942.
Begin joined the militant Irgun Zvai Leumi and was its commander from 1943 to 1948.
After Israel’s independence in 1948 the Irgun formed the Ḥerut (“Freedom”) Party with
Begin as its head and leader of the opposition in the Knesset (Parliament) until 1967. Begin
joined the National Unity government (1967–70) as a minister without portfolio and in
1973 became joint chairman of the Likud (“Unity”) coalition.
On May 17, 1977, the Likud Party won a national
electoral victory and on June 21 Begin formed a
government. He was perhaps best known for his
uncompromising stand on the question of retaining
the West Bank and the Gaza Strip, which had been
occupied by Israel during the Arab-Israeli War of
1967. Prodded by U.S. Pres. Jimmy Carter, however,
Begin negotiated with Pres. Anwar el-Sādāt of Egypt
for peace in the Middle East, and the agreements they reached, known as the Camp David
Accords (September 17, 1978), led directly to a peace treaty between Israel and Egypt that
was signed on March 26, 1979. Under the terms of the treaty, Israel returned the Sinai
Peninsula, which it had occupied since the 1967 war, to Egypt in exchange for full

diplomatic recognition. Begin and Sādāt were jointly awarded the Nobel Prize for Peace in
1978.
Begin formed another coalition government after the general election of 1981. Despite his
willingness to return the Sinai Peninsula to Egypt under the terms of the peace agreement,
he remained resolutely opposed to the establishment of a Palestinian state in the West Bank
and Gaza Strip. In June 1982 his government mounted an invasion of Lebanon in an effort
to oust the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) from its bases there. The PLO was
driven from Lebanon, but the deaths of numerous Palestinian civilians there turned world
opinion against Israel. Israel’s continuing involvement in Lebanon, and the death of
Begin’s wife in November 1982, were probably among the factors that prompted him to
resign from office in October 1983.

Mercy Otis Warren
Mercy Otis Warren, née Mercy Otis, (born
September 14 [September 25, New Style], 1728,
Barnstable, Massachusetts [U.S.]—died October 19,
1814, Plymouth, Massachusetts, U.S.), American
poet, dramatist, and historian whose proximity to
political leaders and critical national events gives
particular value to her writing on the American
Revolutionary period. She is considered by some to be the first American woman to write
primarily for the public rather than for herself.
Mercy Otis was born to a prosperous Cape Cod family. One of her brothers was the
political activist and firebrand James Otis, who was early involved in events leading to the
American Revolution. She received no formal schooling but managed to absorb something
of an education from her uncle, the Rev. Jonathan Russell, who tutored her brothers and
allowed her to study by their side in all subjects except Latin and Greek. In 1754 she
married James Warren, a merchant and farmer who went on to serve in the Massachusetts
legislature (1766–78), and bore five children. Because of her husband’s political
associations, Warren was personally acquainted with most of the leaders of the Revolution
and was continually at or near the centre of events for more than two decades, from the
Stamp Act crisis of 1765 to the establishment of the federal republic in 1789.
After her brother James was brutally beaten by colonial revenue officers in 1769, Warren
was increasingly drawn to political activism and hosted protest meetings at her home that
resulted in the organization of the Committees of Correspondence. Combining her unique
vantage point and fervent beliefs with a talent for writing, she then became both a poet and
a historian of the Revolutionary era, beginning with a trio of scathingly polemical plays in
verse that were published serially in a Boston newspaper. The Adulateur (1772) foretold the
War of Revolution through the actions of Rapatio, a haughty, imperious official obviously
modeled on Massachusetts’s royal governor, Thomas Hutchinson. The Defeat, also
featuring Rapatio, followed a year later, and in 1775 Warren published The Group, a satire
conjecturing what would happen if the British king abrogated the Massachusetts charter of
rights. The anonymously published prose dramas The Blockheads (1776) and The Motley
Assembly (1779), no less acerbic, are also attributed to her.

Mercy Otis Warren: A History of
the Rise, Progress, and
Termination of the American
Revolution
As the young United States, and Massachusetts in
particular, began to move in a Federalist direction
following the war, Warren remained steadfastly
Republican. In 1788 she published Observations on
the New Constitution, detailing her opposition to the
document on account of its emphasis on a strong
central government. Warren maintained social and
political correspondences with her friends John and
Abigail Adams. She wrote the latter about her belief
that the relegation of women to minor concerns reflected not their inferior intellect but the
inferior opportunities offered them to develop their capacities. She also corresponded with
George Washington and Thomas Jefferson. In 1790 she published Poems, Dramatic and
Miscellaneous, a collection of her works that contained two new plays, The Sack of Rome
and The Ladies of Castille. In 1805 Warren completed a three-volume history titled A
History of the Rise, Progress, and Termination of the American Revolution. The work
deliberately avoided dull accounts of “military havoc” in favour of knowledgeable
comments on the important personages of the day, which remain especially useful. Its
marginalizing and sharply critical treatment of John Adams led to a heated correspondence
and a breach in Warren’s friendship with the Adamses that lasted until 1812.

Michael Collins
Michael Collins, (born October 16, 1890, Woodfield,
Sam’s Cross, County Cork, Ireland—died August 22,
1922, Béal-na-mBlath, Cork), hero of the Irish
struggle for independence, best remembered for his
daring strategy in directing the campaign of guerrilla
warfare during the intensification of the Anglo-Irish
War (1919–21).
Collins worked as a clerk in London from 1906 until he returned to Ireland in 1916. He
fought in the Easter Rising, was arrested and held in detention at Frongoch, Merioneth, but
was released in December 1916. In December 1918 he was one of 27 out of 73 elected Sinn
Féin members (most of whom were in jail) present when Dáil Éireann (Irish Assembly)
convened in Dublin and declared for the republic. Their elected president, Eamon de
Valera, and vice president, Arthur Griffith, were both in prison. Hence, much responsibility
fell on Collins, who became first the Dáil’s minister of home affairs and, after arranging for
de Valera’s escape from Lincoln jail (February 1919), minister of finance. It was as director
of intelligence of the Irish Republican Army (IRA), however, that he became famous. As
chief planner and coordinator of the revolutionary movement, Collins organized numerous
attacks on police and the assassination in November 1920 of many of Britain’s leading
intelligence agents in Ireland. He headed the list of men wanted by the British, who placed
a price of £10,000 on his head.
After the truce of July 1921, Griffith and Collins were sent to London by de Valera as the
principal negotiators for peace (October–December 1921). The treaty of December 6, 1921,
was signed by Collins in the belief that it was the best that could be obtained for Ireland at
the time and in the full awareness that he might be signing his own death warrant. It gave
Ireland dominion status, but its provision for an oath of allegiance to the British crown was
unacceptable to de Valera and other republican leaders. Collins’s persuasiveness helped win
acceptance for the treaty by a small majority in the Dáil, and a provisional government was
formed under his chairmanship, but effective administration was obstructed by the
mutinous activities of the anti-treaty republicans. Collins refrained from taking action
against his former comrades until IRA insurgents seized the Four Courts in Dublin and civil
war became inevitable. William Thomas Cosgrave replaced Collins as chairman when the
latter assumed command of the army in mid-July 1922 in order to crush the insurgency.

Miguel Hidalgo y Costilla
Miguel Hidalgo y Costilla, (born May 8, 1753,
Corralejo, near Guanajuato, Mexico—died July 30,
1811, Chihuahua), Roman Catholic priest and
revolutionary leader who is called the father of
Mexican independence.
Hidalgo was the second child born to Cristóbal
Hidalgo and his wife. He studied at a Jesuit secondary school, received a bachelor’s degree
in theology and philosophy in 1773 from San Nicolás College (now Michoacán University
of San Nicolás de Hidalgo) in Valladolid (now Morelia), and was ordained a priest in 1778.
He had an uneventful early career, but in 1803 Hidalgo assumed his recently deceased elder
brother’s duties as parish priest in Dolores (now Dolores Hidalgo, Guanajuato state). His
interest in the economic advancement of his parishioners—for example, through the
introduction of newer methods of agriculture—and his political convictions regarding the
oppression of the people by the Spanish authorities caused the latter to regard him with
suspicion.
In 1808 Spain was invaded by French troops, and
Napoleon I forced the abdication of King Ferdinand
VII in favour of the French emperor’s brother Joseph
Bonaparte. Though Spanish officials in Mexico were
loath to oppose the new king, many Mexicans formed
secret societies—some supporting Ferdinand, others
advocating independence from Spain. Hidalgo
belonged to a pro-independence group in San Miguel
(now San Miguel de Allende), near Dolores. When the plot was betrayed to the Spanish,
several members were arrested. Warned to flee, Hidalgo decided instead to act promptly.
On September 16, 1810, he rang the church bell in Dolores to call his parishioners to an
announcement of revolution against the Spanish. His speech was not only an
encouragement to revolt but a cry for racial equality and the redistribution of land. It
became known as the Grito de Dolores (“Cry of Dolores”).
What he began in San Miguel as a movement for independence became a social and
economic war of the masses against the upper classes. Joined by thousands of Indians and
mestizos, Hidalgo marched forth from Dolores under the banner of Our Lady of

followers melted away. Royalists as well as other
elements in Mexico were frightened by the prospect
of social upheaval and supported the suppression of
the rebellion. After his defeat at Calderón Bridge,
outside Guadalajara, on January 17, 1811, Hidalgo fled north, hoping to escape into the
United States. He was caught, expelled from the priesthood, and executed by firing squad
as a rebel.
Though his accomplishments were not lasting ones, Hidalgo’s name became the symbol of
the independence movement for most Mexicans. September 16, the anniversary of the
Grito de Dolores, is now celebrated as Mexico’s Independence Day.

Hidalgo was the second child born to Cristóbal Hidalgo and his wife. He studied at a Jesuit secondary school, received a bachelor’s degree in theology and philosophy in 1773 from San Nicolás College (now Michoacán University of San Nicolás de Hidalgo) in Valladolid (now Morelia), and was ordained a priest in 1778. He had an uneventful early career, but in 1803 Hidalgo assumed his recently deceased elder brother’s duties as parish priest in Dolores (now Dolores Hidalgo, Guanajuato state). His interest in the economic advancement of his parishioners—for example, through the introduction of newer methods of agriculture—and his political convictions regarding the oppression of the people by the Spanish authorities caused the latter to regard him with suspicion. In 1808 Spain was invaded by French troops, and Napoleon I forced the abdication of King Ferdinand VII in favour of the French emperor’s brother Joseph Bonaparte. Though Spanish officials in Mexico were loath to oppose the new king, many Mexicans formed secret societies—some supporting Ferdinand, others advocating independence from Spain. Hidalgo belonged to a pro-independence group in San Miguel (now San Miguel de Allende), near Dolores. When the plot was betrayed to the Spanish, several members were arrested. Warned to flee, Hidalgo decided instead to act promptly. On September 16, 1810, he rang the church bell in Dolores to call his parishioners to an announcement of revolution against the Spanish. His speech was not only an encouragement to revolt but a cry for racial equality and the redistribution of land. It became known as the Grito de Dolores (“Cry of Dolores”).

Miloš
Miloš, English Milosh, Serbo-Croatian in full Miloš Obrenović, original name Miloš
Teodorović, (born March 7 [March 18, New Style], 1780, Srednja Dobrinja, Serbia—died
Sept. 14 [Sept. 26], 1860, Topčider, near Belgrade), Serbian peasant revolutionary who
became prince of Serbia (1815–39 and 1858–60) and who founded the Obrenović dynasty.
Miloš Teodorović, originally a herdsman, worked for his half brother Milan Obrenović,
then joined Karadjordje, who was leading the Serbs in a rebellion against their Ottoman
Turkish rulers (1804–13). In 1805 Miloš was appointed a commander in the rebel forces,
but after his half brother was killed (1810), possibly by Karadjordje, he took the surname
Obrenović and assumed an enmity toward Karadjordje. When Karadjordje fled into
Hungary following the collapse of his revolt (1813), Miloš remained in Serbia. The Turks
appointed him knez (prince) of three central Serb districts, and he cooperated with them in
pacifying the country, even helping in the suppression of a new revolt (1814). But when the
Turks began large-scale massacres, Miloš gathered his followers at Takovo, Serbia, and on
Palm Sunday (April 1815) began his own revolt, quickly winning a series of military
victories. Because the Turks feared that Russia might intervene on the Serbs’ behalf, a
peace settlement was soon arranged (December 1815). The Turks recognized Miloš as
prince of Serbia, which was granted a large degree of autonomy but remained a part of the
Ottoman Empire; they also allowed the Serbs to retain their weapons and to hold their own
national assembly, or Skupština.
Miloš, who shortly thereafter ordered that Karadjordje be murdered, consolidated his
position and in November 1817 was named the hereditary prince of Serbia by the
Skupština. Demonstrating himself to be a patient yet determined diplomat, Miloš then
conducted prolonged negotiations with the Turks, who finally recognized Miloš’ position as
hereditary and granted full autonomy to the Serb principality (Aug. 28, 1830). Three years
later Miloš also acquired possession of the eastern Serb lands that the Turks had originally
excluded from his jurisdiction (May 25, 1833).
Despite his diplomatic successes, his achievements in promoting trade, reorganizing the
army, and building roads and his agricultural and land-distribution policies favouring
peasants with small landholdings, Miloš’ autocratic methods aroused strong opposition. In
1835 he was compelled to grant a constitution; and when Russia and Turkey forced him to
repeal it (regarding it as too liberal), the Turkish sultan promulgated another constitution
for Serbia in December 1838. In accordance with it, Miloš appointed a council of 17

senators, who immediately demanded his abdication. Naming his son Milan as his
successor (June 13, 1839), Miloš Obrenović retired to his estates in Walachia.
Twenty years later the Skupština called on Miloš to return to the throne to replace
Alexander Karadjordjević (reigned 1842–58), whom it had deposed in December 1858.
Resuming his autocratic methods, Miloš then adopted policies that defied Austria, which
had gained a great deal of influence over Serbia during the preceding reign. He also
demanded that the Turks again recognize his position as hereditary and reduce their
military strength inside Serbia. Before he could accomplish his aims, however, he died.

Milton Obote
Milton Obote, in full Apollo Milton Obote, (born
December 28, 1924, Akoroko village, Lango, Uganda
—died October 10, 2005, Johannesburg, South
Africa), politician who was prime minister (1962–70)
and twice president (1966–71, 1980–85) of Uganda.
He led his country to independence in 1962, but his
two terms in office (both of which were ended by
military coups) were consumed by struggles between Uganda’s northern and southern
ethnic groups.
Obote was born the third of nine children in a farming family in north-central Uganda. He
first attended Busoga College in Mwiri and then Makerere College in Kampala from 1948
to 1949, but he was expelled from the latter for his political activities before he could
graduate. The British colonial government prevented him from accepting scholarships to
study in the United States and West Germany, and in 1950 Obote went to Kenya. There,
while working as a labourer, clerk, and salesman, he became involved in the independence
movement and joined the Kenya African Union.
Obote returned to Uganda in 1957 and became a member of the Uganda National Congress
Party. In 1958 he was elected to represent his home district in the Legislative Council,
where, despite the fact that he was one of a small number of African delegates, he did not
hesitate to criticize the British government. When the National Congress Party split, he
formed the Uganda People’s Congress (UPC), which drew its support mainly from the
northern Acholi and Lango peoples. The UPC’s main political focus was opposition to the
powerful southern kingdom of Buganda under King Mutesa II. Having become prime
minister in 1962, Obote accepted a constitution that granted federal status within Uganda to
five traditional kingdoms, including Buganda. He was thus able to form a governing
coalition made up of his UPC and Buganda’s Kabaka Yekka (“King Alone”) Party. In 1963
Mutesa was elected to the (largely ceremonial) post of president with Obote’s
encouragement.
In 1966, however, the conflict between Obote and Buganda reached a head. Obote sent
troops led by Idi Amin, an officer from a northern district, to attack Mutesa’s palace, and
Mutesa fled to Great Britain. In an effort to solidify his rule, Obote introduced a new
constitution that abolished all the kingdoms and other remnants of federalism in the

country. The new constitution also established an executive presidency, which Obote
assumed while continuing to serve as prime minister. But Obote’s increasing reliance on
the military and police to terrorize his political opponents aroused the resentment of
southern Ugandans, and it allowed Amin to build a following based on recruits from among
his own Kakwa people. Early in 1971 Obote was overthrown in a coup led by Amin.
Obote settled in neighbouring Tanzania, where he maintained a small émigré army under
the generalship of Tito Okello, an Acholi. This army aided Tanzanian forces in deposing
Amin in 1979, and Okello was able to secure Obote’s election to the presidency after
Obote’s return from exile in May 1980. As president, Obote solicited foreign aid in an
attempt to raise Uganda’s economy from the ruin of the Amin years, but he did nothing to
prevent Acholi and Lango soldiers from conducting a campaign of murder and pillage in
the south and in Amin’s home district. In 1985 Obote was forced out of office by Okello.
He eventually settled in Zambia but continued to play an active role in the UPC until his
death in 2005.

Mirabehn, byname of Madeleine Slade, (born
November 22, 1892, Surrey, England—died July 20,
1982, Vienna, Austria), British-born follower of
Mahatma Gandhi who participated in the movement
for India’s independence.
Madeleine Slade was the daughter of an English
aristocratic family. Because her father, Sir Edmond Slade, was a rear admiral in the British
Royal Navy and was often away, Madeleine and her siblings spent much of their childhood
at their grandfather’s country home in Surrey. She developed a strong admiration for the
music of Ludwig van Beethoven and eventually became a concert manager.
Her aristocratic existence took a life-changing turn after she read French novelist and
essayist Romain Rolland’s 1924 biography of Gandhi. In the book the author had described
Gandhi as the greatest personality of the 20th century. Slade became fascinated by the
principles of nonviolence and contacted Gandhi himself, asking if she could become his
disciple and live in his ashram (ashrama; religious retreat) in the western Indian region of
Gujarat. Gandhi, while replying in the affirmative, forewarned her of the difficulties of
such a life. Undeterred, Slade reached India in November 1925 and made India her home
for the next 34 years. She chose not to return to England for personal visits, even when her
father died in 1926.
Upon her arrival at the ashram, Gandhi gave her the nickname Mirabehn (“Sister Mira”),
named for Mira (or Meera) Bai, the Hindu mystic and great devotee to the god Krishna.
She started wearing a white sari, cut her hair short, and took a vow of celibacy. During the
first two years in India, she learned Hindi and spent much time spinning and carding
cotton. Subsequently, she started traveling to various parts of the country to work in
villages.
Mirabehn often accompanied Gandhi on his tours and looked after his personal needs. She
became one of Gandhi’s confidants and an ardent champion internationally for India’s
freedom from British rule and was with Gandhi at the London Round Table Conference in
1931. In 1934 she made a brief visit to the United States for lectures and radio talks and
met first lady Eleanor Roosevelt for an interview at the White House. Before returning to
India, she conducted interviews with a number of British politicians in the United Kingdom

A devoted worker, Mirabehn was active in spreading the spirit of nonviolence, and she was
considered by the British to be important to India’s independence movement. She was
arrested multiple times, including during a period of civil disobedience in 1932–33, when
she was detained on the charge of supplying information to Europe and America regarding
conditions prevailing in India; and in 1942, when she was imprisoned in the Aga Khan
Palace in Pune along with Gandhi and his wife, Kasturba (the latter died there in 1944).
In 1946 Mirabehn was appointed as honorary special adviser to the Uttar Pradesh
government to assist in a campaign to expand agricultural production. In 1947 she set up an
ashram near Rishikesh. Following Gandhi’s assassination in 1948, Mirabehn decided to
stay in India. For the next 11 years, she traveled to various Indian states, took on
community projects including one that came to be known as the Gopal Ashram in the
Bhilangana valley (now in the state of Uttarakhand), and worked on environmental issues
such as those preventing deforestation and implementing flood-control measures. She even
experimented with the introduction of Dexter cattle from England for crossbreeding with
the yak in an area of Jammu and Kashmir state (now in Ladakh union territory).
Mirabehn returned to England in 1959 and a year later moved to a house near Vienna,
where she spent the remaining years of her life. A year before her death, the Indian
government conferred on her the Padma Vibhushan medal, the country’s second highest
civilian honour.
Among her writings are New and Old Gleanings, published in 1960 (an updated edition of
Gleanings Gathered at Bapu’s Feet, originally published in 1949), and her autobiography,
The Spirit’s Pilgrimage, also published in 1960.

Madeleine Slade was the daughter of an English aristocratic family. Because her father, Sir Edmond Slade, was a rear admiral in the British Royal Navy and was often away, Madeleine and her siblings spent much of their childhood at their grandfather’s country home in Surrey. She developed a strong admiration for the music of Ludwig van Beethoven and eventually became a concert manager. Her aristocratic existence took a life-changing turn after she read French novelist and essayist Romain Rolland’s 1924 biography of Gandhi. In the book the author had described Gandhi as the greatest personality of the 20th century. Slade became fascinated by the principles of nonviolence and contacted Gandhi himself, asking if she could become his disciple and live in his ashram (ashrama; religious retreat) in the western Indian region of Gujarat.

Upon her arrival at the ashram, Gandhi gave her the nickname Mirabehn (“Sister Mira”), named for Mira (or Meera) Bai, the Hindu mystic and great devotee to the god Krishna. She started wearing a white sari, cut her hair short, and took a vow of celibacy. During the first two years in India, she learned Hindi and spent much time spinning and carding cotton.

Mohammad Hatta
Mohammad Hatta, (born August 12, 1902, Bukittinggi, Sumatra, Dutch East Indies [now
in Indonesia]—died March 14, 1980, Jakarta, Indonesia), a leader of the Indonesian
independence movement who was prime minister (1948–50) and vice president (1950–56)
of Indonesia.
While he studied in the Netherlands from 1922 to 1932, he was president of the
Perhimpunan Indonesia (Indonesian Union), a progressive, nationalist political group
founded by overseas Indonesian students. Returning to the Dutch East Indies in 1932, Hatta
was arrested for his political activities by the Dutch in 1934 and sent to the infamous
concentration camp of Boven Digul in West New Guinea. In 1935 he was exiled to the
island of Bandanaira, where he remained until the eve of the Japanese invasion in World
War II.
In contrast to the Dutch, the Japanese actively promoted Indonesian nationalism. Hatta and
Sukarno, the future president of Indonesia, collaborated with them in establishing
numerous Indonesian mass organizations; in 1943 they helped to organize the Japanese-
sponsored home defense corps Sukarela Tentara Pembela Tanah Air (Peta), the first
Indonesian armed force. When it became clear that the Japanese would lose the war,
however, many nationalists urged an insurrection and immediate independence, but Hatta
advised patience until they were sure that the Japanese would surrender. On August 17,
1945, he and Sukarno were kidnapped by members of the students’ union and persuaded to
declare Indonesian independence. Hatta served as vice president in the subsequent
revolutionary government. In 1948, when he was prime minister, he played an important
part in the suppression of the communist revolt at Madiun in eastern Java, a measure that
gained the struggling government many supporters in Western countries. He led the
Indonesian delegation at the United Nations-sponsored Hague Conference (August 23–
November 2, 1949) that culminated in the recognition by the Netherlands of Indonesia’s
complete independence. While serving as prime minister during the first seven months of
1950, he helped to guide the new country through a crucial period of transition from a
federal to a unified state.
Hatta served as vice president until December 1956, when he resigned because of
increasing disagreement with President Sukarno’s policy of “guided democracy.”
Essentially a moderate, administratively oriented leader, Hatta felt that dealing with
Indonesia’s grave economic crises was of primary importance and feared that Sukarno’s

policies would bankrupt the country. He was also consistently critical of Sukarno’s anti-
Western and anti-Malaysian foreign policy. After Sukarno’s downfall, Hatta came out of
retirement to serve as special adviser to President Suharto on the problem of government
corruption.
One of Indonesia’s leading economists, Hatta is known as the “father of the Indonesian
cooperative movement.” His writings include The Co-operative Movement in Indonesia
(1957), “Indonesia between the Power Blocs,” Foreign Affairs, vol. 36 (1958), and Past
and Future (1960).

Mohammed Ali Jinnah
Mohammed Ali Jinnah, also called Qaid-i-Azam
(Arabic: “Great Leader”), (born December 25,
1876?, Karachi, India [now in Pakistan]—died
September 11, 1948, Karachi), Indian Muslim
politician, who was the founder and first governor-
general (1947–48) of Pakistan.
Early years
Jinnah was the eldest of seven children of Jinnahbhai Poonja, a prosperous merchant, and
his wife, Mithibai. His family was a member of the Khoja caste, Hindus who had converted
to Islam centuries earlier and who were followers of the Aga Khan. There is some question
about Jinnah’s date of birth: although he maintained that it was December 25, 1876, school
records from Karachi (Pakistan) give a date of October 20, 1875.
After being taught at home, Jinnah was sent in 1887 to the Sind Madrasat al-Islam (now
Sindh Madressatul Islam University) in Karachi. Later he attended the Christian
Missionary Society High School (also in Karachi), where at the age of 16 he passed the
matriculation examination of the University of Bombay (now University of Mumbai, in
Mumbai, India). On the advice of an English friend, his father decided to send him to
England to acquire business experience. Jinnah, however, had made up his mind to become
a barrister. In keeping with the custom of the time, his parents arranged for an early
marriage for him before he left for England.
In London he joined Lincoln’s Inn, one of the legal societies that prepared students for the
bar. In 1895, at the age of 19, he was called to the bar. While in London Jinnah suffered
two severe bereavements—the deaths of his wife and his mother. Nevertheless, he
completed his formal studies and also made a study of the British political system,
frequently visiting the House of Commons. He was greatly influenced by the liberalism of
William E. Gladstone, who had become prime minister for the fourth time in 1892, the year
of Jinnah’s arrival in London. Jinnah also took a keen interest in the affairs of India and in
Indian students. When the Parsi leader Dadabhai Naoroji, a leading Indian nationalist, ran
for the British Parliament, Jinnah and other Indian students worked day and night for him.
Their efforts were crowned with success: Naoroji became the first Indian to sit in the House
of Commons.

When Jinnah returned to Karachi in 1896, he found that his father’s business had suffered
losses and that he now had to depend on himself. He decided to start his legal practice in
Bombay (now Mumbai), but it took him years of work to establish himself as a lawyer.
It was nearly 10 years later that he turned actively toward politics. A man without hobbies,
he divided his interest between law and politics. Nor was he a religious zealot: he was a
Muslim in a broad sense and had little to do with sects. His interest in women was also
limited, to Rattenbai (Rutti)—the daughter of Sir Dinshaw Petit, a Bombay Parsi
millionaire—whom he married in 1918 over tremendous opposition from her parents and
others. The couple had one daughter, Dina, but the marriage proved an unhappy one, and
Jinnah and Rutti soon separated. It was his sister Fatima who gave him solace and
company.
Mahmud Husain The Editors of Encyclopaedia Britannica
Entry into politics
Jinnah first entered politics by participating in the 1906 session of the Indian National
Congress (Congress Party) held at Calcutta (now Kolkata), in which the party began to split
between those calling for dominion status and those advocating independence for India.
Four years later he was elected to the Imperial Legislative Council—the beginning of a
long and distinguished parliamentary career. In Bombay he came to know, among other
important Congress Party personalities, Gopal Krishna Gokhale, the eminent Maratha
leader. Greatly influenced by those nationalist politicians, Jinnah aspired during the early
part of his political life to become “a Muslim Gokhale.” Admiration for British political
institutions and an eagerness to raise the status of India in the international community and
to develop a sense of Indian nationhood among the peoples of India were the chief
elements of his politics. At that time, he still looked upon Muslim interests in the context of
Indian nationalism.
But, by the beginning of the 20th century, the conviction had been growing among the
Muslims that their interests demanded the preservation of their separate identity rather than
amalgamation in the Indian nation that would for all practical purposes be Hindu. Largely
to safeguard Muslim interests, the All-India Muslim League was founded in 1906. But
Jinnah remained aloof from it. Only in 1913, when authoritatively assured that the league
was as devoted as the Congress Party to the political emancipation of India, did Jinnah join
the league. When the Indian Home Rule League was formed, he became its chief organizer
in Bombay and was elected president of the Bombay branch.

Political unity
Jinnah’s endeavours to bring about the political union of Hindus and Muslims earned him
the title of “the best ambassador of Hindu-Muslim unity,” an epithet coined by Gokhale. It
was largely through his efforts that the Congress Party and the Muslim League began to
hold their annual sessions jointly, to facilitate mutual consultation and participation. In
1915 the two organizations held their meetings in Bombay and in 1916 in Lucknow, where
the Lucknow Pact was concluded. Under the terms of the pact, the two organizations put
their seal to a scheme of constitutional reform that became their joint demand vis-à-vis the
British government. There was a good deal of give and take, but the Muslims obtained one
important concession in the shape of separate electorates, already conceded to them by the
government in 1909 but hitherto resisted by Congress.
Meanwhile, a new force in Indian politics had appeared in the person of Mohandas
(Mahatma) Gandhi. Both the Home Rule League and the Congress Party had come under
his sway. Opposed to Gandhi’s noncooperation movement and his essentially Hindu
approach to politics, Jinnah left both the league and the Congress Party in 1920. For a few
years he kept himself aloof from the main political movements. He continued to be a firm
believer in Hindu-Muslim unity and constitutional methods for the achievement of political
ends. After his withdrawal from Congress, he used the Muslim League platform for the
propagation of his views. But during the 1920s the Muslim League, and with it Jinnah, had
been overshadowed by Congress and the religiously oriented Muslim Khilafat movement.
When the failure of the noncooperation movement and the emergence of Hindu revivalist
movements led to antagonism and riots between Hindus and Muslims, the Muslim League
began to lose strength and cohesion, and provincial Muslim leaders formed their own
parties to serve their needs. Thus, Jinnah’s problem during the following years was to
convert the Muslim League into an enlightened, unified political body prepared to
cooperate with other organizations working for the good of India. In addition, he had to
convince the Congress Party, as a prerequisite for political progress, of the necessity of
settling the Hindu-Muslim conflict.
To bring about such a rapprochement was Jinnah’s chief purpose during the late 1920s and
early 1930s. He worked toward this end within the legislative assembly, at the Round Table
Conference in London (1930–32), and through his “14 points,” which included proposals
for a federal form of government, greater rights for minorities, one-third representation for
Muslims in the central legislature, separation of the predominantly Muslim Sindh region

from the rest of the Bombay province, and introduction of reforms in the North-West
Frontier Province. His failure to bring about even minor amendments in the Nehru
Committee proposals (1928) over the question of separate electorates and reservation of
seats for Muslims in the legislatures frustrated him. He found himself in a peculiar position
at that time: many Muslims thought that he was too nationalistic in his policy and that
Muslim interests were not safe in his hands, while the Congress Party would not even meet
the moderate Muslim demands halfway. Indeed, the Muslim League was a house divided
against itself. The Punjab Muslim League repudiated Jinnah’s leadership and organized
itself separately. In disgust, Jinnah decided to settle in England. From 1930 to 1935 he
remained in London, devoting himself to practice before the Privy Council. But when
constitutional changes were in the offing, he was persuaded to return home to head a
reconstituted Muslim League.
Soon preparations started for the elections under the Government of India Act of 1935.
Jinnah was still thinking in terms of cooperation between the Muslim League and the
Hindu-controlled Congress Party and with coalition governments in the provinces. But the
elections of 1937 proved to be a turning point in the relations between the two
organizations. Congress obtained an absolute majority in six provinces, and the league did
not do particularly well. The Congress Party decided not to include the league in the
formation of provincial governments, and exclusive all-Congress governments were the
result. Relations between Hindus and Muslims started to deteriorate, and soon Muslim
discontent became boundless.
Creator of Pakistan
Jinnah had originally been dubious about the practicability of Pakistan, an idea that the
poet and philosopher Sir Muhammad Iqbal had propounded to the Muslim League
conference of 1930, but before long he became convinced that a Muslim homeland on the
Indian subcontinent was the only way of safeguarding Muslim interests and the Muslim
way of life. It was not religious persecution that he feared so much as the future exclusion
of Muslims from all prospects of advancement within India, as soon as power became
vested in the close-knit structure of Hindu social organization. To guard against that danger,
he carried out a nationwide campaign to warn his coreligionists of the perils of their
position, and he converted the Muslim League into a powerful instrument for unifying the
Muslims into a nation.
At that point, Jinnah emerged as the leader of a renascent Muslim nation. Events began to
move fast. On March 22–23, 1940, in Lahore, the league adopted a resolution to form a

separate Muslim state, Pakistan. The Pakistan idea was at first ridiculed and then
tenaciously opposed by the Congress Party. But it captured the imagination of the Muslims.
Pitted against Jinnah were many influential Hindus, including Gandhi and Jawaharlal
Nehru. And the British government seemed to be intent on maintaining the political unity
of the Indian subcontinent. But Jinnah led his movement with such skill and tenacity that
ultimately both the Congress Party and the British government had no option but to agree
to the partitioning of India. Pakistan thus emerged as an independent state in 1947.
Jinnah became the first head of the new state. Faced
with the serious problems of a young country, he
tackled Pakistan’s problems with authority. He was
not regarded as merely the governor-general. He was
revered as the father of the nation. He worked hard
until overpowered by age and disease in Karachi, the
place of his birth, in 1948.

Moktar Ould Daddah
Moktar Ould Daddah, (born December 25, 1924,
Boutilimit, Mauritania, French West Africa—died
October 14, 2003, Paris, France), statesman who was
independent Mauritania’s first president (1961–78).
He was noted for his progress in unifying his
ethnically mixed, dispersed, and partly nomadic
people under his authoritarian but enlightened rule.
Of aristocratic background, Moktar Ould Daddah was the first Mauritanian to graduate
from a university and to become a lawyer. When he returned from Paris in the mid-1950s,
he joined the more moderate of two rival parties, the Progressive Mauritanian Union, and
in 1957 was elected to the territorial assembly. By 1958 he was president of the Executive
Council and the natural choice for prime minister in 1959 and president in 1961 after
Mauritania attained independence. Meanwhile, in 1958 he had established a new unity
party, the Mauritanian Regrouping Party, which in 1960 incorporated the chief remaining
opposition party.
Moktar Ould Daddah’s first aim was national unity, a delicate problem in a country divided
between a minority agricultural south and a largely nomadic Moorish centre and north. At
first he tried to balance regional notables and impatient young modernizers in a basically
parliamentary regime, but in 1964 he shifted to an authoritarian one-party system
(Mauritanian People’s Party, of which he was secretary-general). In July 1978
dissatisfaction with the costly attempt by Mauritania to annex part of former Spanish
Sahara resulted in his ouster by a military coup d’état led by Lieutenant Colonel Mustafa
Ould Salek.

Moshe Dayan
Moshe Dayan, (born May 20, 1915, Deganya, Palestine
[now in Israel]—died Oct. 16, 1981, Tel Aviv, Israel),
soldier and statesman who led Israel to dramatic victories
over its Arab neighbours and became a symbol of security
to his countrymen.
Dayan was born on Israel’s first kibbutz and was raised on the country’s first successful
cooperative farm settlement (moshav), Nahalal. He began his military career in 1937, when
he learned guerrilla warfare from the British officer Captain Orde Wingate in the special
night squadrons. These were organized to fight Arab rebel bands in Palestine, and they
formed the nucleus of a Jewish army. Convinced that the Jews would have to fight for their
independence, Dayan joined the Haganah, an illegal Jewish defense force, and was arrested
and imprisoned (1939–41) by British authorities. After his release he led Palestinian Jewish
forces against the Vichy French in Syria, where he lost his left eye in action, thereafter
wearing the black patch that became his hallmark.
In Israel’s war of independence in 1948, Dayan was commander of the Jerusalem area, and
in 1949 he participated in armistice negotiations between Jordan and Israel. While chief of
staff of the Israeli armed forces (1953–58), he planned and led the 1956 invasion of the
Sinai Peninsula. That conflict with Egypt established his reputation as a military
commander. His memoirs of the action, Diary of the Sinai Campaign, were published in
1966.
In 1959 Dayan was elected to the Knesset (Parliament) as a member of Mapai, a party
within the Israel Labour Party coalition, and was appointed minister of agriculture by his
long-time mentor, Prime Minister David Ben-Gurion. He served until 1964, when he
resigned during a political conflict between factions led by Ben-Gurion and by the new
prime minister, Levi Eshkol.
Dayan was again elected to the Knesset in 1965 as a member of Ben-Gurion’s new splinter
party, Rafi (Alliance of Israel’s Workers). On June 1, 1967, when war with Israel’s Arab
neighbours was imminent, Dayan was appointed minister of defense. Together with the
chief of staff, Yitzhak Rabin, he directed operations during the Six-Day War (June 5–10,
1967), and he later administered the territories occupied by Israel. Dayan gained increasing
influence over Israel’s conduct of foreign affairs in the early 1970s, but when Egypt and

Syria unexpectedly attacked Israel on Oct. 6, 1973 (Yom Kippur), Dayan was pilloried for
the country’s lack of preparedness. When Rabin succeeded Golda Meir as prime minister in
June 1974, he dropped Dayan from the Cabinet. Four years later, as foreign minister under
Menachem Begin, Dayan became one of the chief architects of the Camp David Accords.
Then, angered by Begin’s plan to assert Israeli sovereignty over the occupied West Bank
area which was legally still part of Jordan, he resigned in October 1979. In 1981 he formed
a new party, Telem, which advocated unilateral Israeli disengagement from the territories
occupied in the 1967 wars. Dayan’s autobiography, The Story of My Life, was published in
1976.
After Dayan’s death, controversy arose over his extensive private collection of antiquities,
part of which he had accumulated through unauthorized and unscientific digs. The
collection was eventually sold by his second wife to the Israel Museum.

Motilal Nehru
Motilal Nehru
Motilal Nehru, in full Pandit Motilal Nehru, (born
May 6, 1861, Delhi, India—died Feb. 6, 1931,
Lucknow), a leader of the Indian independence
movement, cofounder of the Swaraj (“Self-rule”)
Party, and the father of India’s first prime minister,
Jawaharlal Nehru.
Motilal, a member of a prosperous Brahman family of Kashmiri origin, early established a
lucrative law practice and was admitted to the Allahabad High Court in 1896. He shunned
politics until middle age, when, in 1907, at Allahabad, he presided over a provincial
conference of the Indian National Congress (Congress Party), a political organization
striving for dominion status for India. He was considered a moderate (one who advocated
constitutional reform, in contrast to the extremists, who employed agitational methods)
until 1919, when he made his newly radicalized views known by means of a daily
newspaper he founded, The Independent.
The massacre of hundreds of Indians by the British at Amritsar in 1919 prompted Motilal
to join Mahatma Gandhi’s noncooperation movement, giving up his career in law and
changing to a simpler, non-Anglicized style of life. In 1921 both he and Jawaharlal were
arrested by the British and jailed for six months.
In 1923 Motilal helped found the Swaraj Party (1923–
27), the policy of which was to win election to the
Central Legislative Assembly and obstruct its
proceedings from within. In 1928 he wrote the
Congress Party’s Nehru Report, a future constitution
for independent India based on the granting of
dominion status. After the British rejected these
proposals, Motilal participated in the civil disobedience movement of 1930 that was related
to the Salt March, for which he was imprisoned. He died soon after release.

Muhammad Boudiaf
Muhammad Boudiaf, (born June 23, 1919, M’Sila, Alg.—died June 29, 1992, Annaba),
Algerian political leader who was a founder of the revolutionary National Liberation Front
(FLN) that led the Algerian war of independence (1954–62), and, after a 27-year exile, the
president of Algeria (1992).
Boudiaf fought in the French army in World War II, but by 1950 he was a central figure in
the nationalist movement against France, and in 1954 he joined Ahmed Ben Bella on the
FLN leadership council. After being captured and imprisoned by the French (1956–62),
Boudiaf and Ben Bella were released to form a provisional government in newly
independent Algeria, with Boudiaf as deputy premier. He opposed President Ben Bella’s
autocratic rule, however, and after being interned for several months, he went into exile in
Morocco (1964), where he managed a brick factory and denounced the increasingly corrupt
FLN. In January 1992, with the Islāmic fundamentalists on the verge of winning
parliamentary elections, he was invited to return as the head of a military-backed council of
state. Although he appeared to have gained public support for his announced reforms, he
was shot and killed while giving a speech; one of his bodyguards was suspected of the
shooting.

Mujibur Rahman
Mujibur Rahman, also called Sheikh Mujib, (born March 17, 1920, Tungipara, India
[now in Bangladesh]—died August 15, 1975, Dhaka, Bangladesh), Bengali leader who
became the president (1971–72; 1975) and prime minister (1972–75) of Bangladesh.
Mujib, the son of a middle-class landowner, studied law and political science at the
Universities of Calcutta and Dacca (now Dhaka). Although jailed briefly as a teenager for
agitating for Indian independence, he began his formal political career in 1949 as a
cofounder of the Awami League. The league advocated political autonomy for East
Pakistan, the detached eastern part of Pakistan. Mujib’s arrest in the late 1960s incited mob
violence that eroded the Pakistani president’s authority in East Pakistan. In the elections of
December 1970, Mujib’s Awami League secured a majority of the seats in the National
Assembly, and Mujib demanded independence for East Pakistan. Troops from West
Pakistan were sent to regain control of the eastern province but were defeated with the help
of India. East Pakistan, renamed Bangladesh, was proclaimed an independent republic in
1971, and in January 1972 Mujib, recently released from prison, became the first prime
minister installed under the country’s new parliamentary government. Faced with
increasing problems, Mujib took tighter control and assumed the presidency in January
1975. He, along with most of his family, was killed in a coup d’état just seven months later.
His daughter, Sheikh Hasina Wazed, who was out of the country at the time of the
overthrow, later served as prime minister of Bangladesh (1996–2001; 2009– ).

Mustafa al-Barzani
Mustafa al-Barzani, (born March 14, 1903, Barzān, Iraq—died March 1, 1979,
Washington, D.C., U.S.), Kurdish military leader who for 50 years strove to create an
independent nation for the millions of Kurds living on the borders of Iran, Iraq, and the
Soviet Union.
The son of a landlord, Barzani succeeded his elder brother, Sheikh Ahmed, who led the
Kurdish national struggle from World War I until the late 1930s. In 1946 Barzani emerged
as commander of the army of the short-lived Kurdish Mahabad Republic, which had been
established with Soviet aid in northwestern Iran. He also founded the Kurdistan
Democratic Party (KDP), which was to remain the most powerful group in Kurdish politics
for decades.
After the Soviet forces withdrew in 1947, the Mahabad Republic was overrun by Iran’s
army, and Barzani took refuge in Soviet Azerbaijan, where he remained until he was
allowed to return to Iraq after that country’s 1958 revolution. Barzani rejected the Iraqi
government’s subsequent offer of autonomy for the Kurdish area in northern Iraq, and in
1960 he escaped to the mountains and started a guerrilla war against the Iraqi forces. After
10 years of intermittent fighting, a cease-fire agreement was reached, followed by a general
amnesty for the insurgent Kurds, and in 1974 a law defining the Kurdish autonomous
region was promulgated by Iraq. Barzani found this compromise unacceptable and ordered
his Peshmerga (“Forward to Death”) Kurdish forces to resume fighting, this time with
considerable support from Iran. When Iranian support ended in 1975, the Kurdish guerrillas
were overrun by the Iraqi forces. Barzani took up residence in Tehrān but then requested
asylum in the United States, where he died. His remains were returned to his birthplace for
burial.
After his death Barzani was succeeded as leader of the KDP by his son, Masoud. Masoud
became the president of the Kurdistan Regional Government in Iraq in 2005.

Muḥammad was the third son of Sultan Mawlāy Yūsuf; when his father died in 1927,
French authorities chose him to be successor, expecting him to be more compliant than his
two older brothers. The first indication of Muḥammad’s nationalist feelings occurred in
1934, when he urged the French to abandon the Berber Dahir legislation of 1930 that had
established different legal systems for the two Moroccan ethnic groups, Imazighen
(Berbers) and Arabs—a policy resented by both groups. It had been promulgated to help
the protectorate, but, instead, it divided the country and accelerated nationalism. Wanting to
make Muḥammad a national symbol, the Moroccan nationalists organized the Fête du
Trône (Throne Day), an annual festival to commemorate the anniversary of Muḥammad’s
assumption of power. On these occasions he gave speeches that, though moderate in tone,
encouraged nationalist sentiment. The French reluctantly agreed to make the festival an
official holiday, and for the next decade Muḥammad remained above nationalist agitation
but gave it his tacit support.
During World War II (1939–45), Muḥammad supported the Allies, and in 1943 he met with
U.S. President Franklin D. Roosevelt, who encouraged him to seek independence.
Muḥammad’s determination increased when French authorities arrested a number of
nationalists in January 1944. In 1947 he visited Tangier (then an international city) and
made a speech stressing Moroccan links with the Arab world, making no mention of
France. He found an effective means of resistance in refusing to sign, and thus make legally
binding, the decrees of the French resident general.
In 1951 the French encouraged a tribal rebellion against him, and, on the pretext of
protecting him, they surrounded his palace with troops. Under these conditions he was
induced to denounce the nationalist movement. In August 1953 the French deported the
sultan to Corsica and then to Madagascar. Acts of terrorism multiplied during Muḥammad’s
absence, and his prestige soared. The French government, already faced with rebellion in
Algeria, allowed him to return in November 1955, and in March 1956 he negotiated a
treaty securing full independence.

Thereafter Muḥammad asserted his personal authority, ruling with moderation. He took the
title of king in 1957. His son al-Ḥasan Muḥammad (who later reigned as Hassan II)
resented the slow pace of government, and in May 1960 Muḥammad made him deputy
prime minister and relinquished active direction of the country.

Muṣṭafā Kāmil
Muṣṭafā Kāmil, also called Muṣṭafā Kāmil Pasha, (born Aug. 14, 1874, Cairo, Egypt—
died Feb. 10, 1908, Cairo), lawyer, journalist, and Egyptian nationalist who was a founder
of the National Party.
Muṣṭafā Kāmil, the son of an army officer, studied law in Cairo and in Toulouse, France,
obtaining a law degree in 1894. Muṣṭafā Kāmil strongly opposed the British occupation of
Egypt and, with the encouragement of the khedive ʿAbbās II, helped establish a secret
society that laid the foundation for what would later be the National Party (Arabic: Al-Ḥizb
al-Waṭanī). In 1900 he founded the daily Al-Liwāʾ (“The Standard”) to put forth the group’s
views. Realizing that independence would be difficult to obtain, he looked to France, which
he saw as the symbol of European liberalism, to help Egypt counter British power. When
France and Great Britain signed the Entente Cordiale in 1904, Muṣṭafā Kāmil turned to the
Ottoman sultan to aid Egypt in its struggle.
Although, nominally, Egypt was a province of the Ottoman Empire, Muṣṭafā Kāmil did not
want a resumption of direct Ottoman rule. Nevertheless, he saw Ottoman solidarity as an
aid in the conflict with the British. He believed that the strength of the Egyptians
themselves could be channeled into a patriotic spirit—a feeling of love for the land and
traditions of Egypt, in which he included the Sudan. He joined in formally founding the
National Party as a political vehicle for these policies in October 1907, but he died a few
months later.

Máximo Gómez y Báez
Máximo Gómez y Báez, (born November 18, 1836, Baní, Dominican Republic—died
June 17, 1905, Havana, Cuba), commander in chief of the Cuban revolutionary forces in
the unsuccessful Ten Years’ War (1868–78) and again in the successful Cuban revolution
against Spain some 20 years later.
Rejecting the clerical career that his mother desired for him, Gómez at age 16 fought
against Haitian forces and later commanded Spanish reserve forces in Santo Domingo,
Dominican Republic. In 1865 he went to Cuba. He joined the Cuban revolution against
Spanish rule in 1868, rising quickly through the ranks to become second in command and
later, in 1870, commander in chief of the rebellion. A master strategist, he organized and
directed the guerrilla forces against the well-equipped Spanish army. The Ten Years’ War
ended inconclusively, however, with a general amnesty and limited concessions to the
Cubans; Gómez and the other revolutionary leaders refused to accept the accord and went
into exile.
When rebellion erupted again in 1895, Gómez returned to Cuba with José Martí and others
to reassume command of the revolutionary forces. Gómez hoped that his guerrilla activity
would induce the United States to intervene to end the destruction of American property,
and, ironically, it was the eventual U.S. military intervention in the Spanish-American War
that completely overshadowed the heroic exploits of Gómez and other Cuban patriots.
When the United States finally granted Cubans limited freedom in 1902, Gómez could
have been elected president but did not wish to accept public office.

Naresuan
Naresuan, also called Phra Naret, (born 1555,
Phitsanulok, Siam [now Thailand]—died April 25,
1605, on the Salween River), king of Siam (1590–
1605), regarded as a national hero by the Thai people
for having liberated the country from the Myanmar
(Burmese).
In 1569 the Myanmar king Bayinnaung (reigned 1551–81) conquered Siam and placed
Naresuan’s father, Maha Thammaracha, on the throne as his vassal. The capital, Ayutthaya,
was pillaged, thousands of Siamese were deported to Myanmar (Burma) as slaves, and
Siam then suffered numerous invasions from Cambodia. At the age of 16 Naresuan was
also made a vassal of Myanmar and appointed governor of the northern province of
Phitsanulok. After campaigning with the Myanmar armies in the Shan states, he renounced
his allegiance to Myanmar in 1584. In a series of brilliant military operations, he defeated
three Myanmar armies that had invaded Siam, frustrated repeated attempts of the Myanmar
to capture the capital, and simultaneously defeated Cambodian invasions. Becoming king
on the death of his father in 1590, Naresuan then took the initiative: he captured the
Cambodian capital of Lovek, made Cambodia a vassal of Siam, and established suzerainty
over the northern kingdom of Chiang Mai. When the Myanmar sent a huge army to curb
his ambitions, Naresuan defeated and killed the Myanmar crown prince in personal combat
early in 1593. Thereafter, Myanmar ceased to be a threat to Siam when civil wars broke out
among contenders for the Myanmar throne, and Naresuan was able to seize the Myanmar
peninsular provinces of Tavoy and Tenasserim, giving Siam a commercial outlet on the
Indian Ocean.
In addition to winning a Siamese independence that was to endure almost two centuries,
Naresuan laid the foundation for the military power and stability that enabled the kingdom
to expand and prosper in the 17th century. He died on a military campaign in the Shan
states in 1605 and was succeeded by his brother Ekathotsarot.

Nicola Fabrizi
Nicola Fabrizi, (born April 4, 1804, Modena, Italian Republic—died March 31, 1885,
Rome), one of the most militant and dedicated leaders of the Risorgimento, the movement
aimed at the unification of Italy.
As a young man, Fabrizi helped plan and execute the 1831 Milan rising against the
Austrians. Unsuccessful in his attempt to revive the revolution in Modena, he was forced to
flee but was captured by the Austrians and imprisoned in Venice. Freed in May 1832, he
went to Marseille, where he joined the revolutionary group “Young Italy,” whose founder,
Giuseppe Mazzini, became his friend and political ally.
After an ill-fated attempt to stir up an insurrection in Savoy (February 1834), Fabrizi went
to Spain to fight the conservative and clerical followers of Don Carlos, who claimed the
Spanish throne. Proceeding to Malta, a refuge for Italian revolutionaries, he founded the
“Italian Legion,” another militant secret society.
From 1848 onward Fabrizi took an even more active part in the revolution. He helped
Francesco Crispi organize the Sicilian revolution of 1848 and fought in defense of Venice
and Rome. After his return to Malta, he helped prepare another Sicilian revolution, which
erupted in 1860. He contributed to the victory of the revolutionary forces and was
appointed governor of Messina and minister of war in Garibaldi’s dictatorship at Palermo.
Named general, he helped suppress brigands in the province of Avellino in southern Italy.
Elected deputy to the Italian parliament in 1861, Fabrizi sat on the extreme left. In 1862 on
his way to Sicily to persuade Garibaldi to give up his march on Rome, he was arrested by
the king of Italy’s lieutenant in Naples. From 1866 to 1867 he fought in the Italian war
against Austria as Garibaldi’s chief of staff. Thereafter, he limited his activity to the Italian
parliament, where he worked diligently to maintain unity among the quarrelling leftist
leaders.

Named general, he helped suppress brigands in the province of Avellino in southern Italy. Elected deputy to the Italian parliament in 1861, Fabrizi sat on the extreme left. In 1862 on his way to Sicily to persuade Garibaldi to give up his march on Rome, he was arrested by the king of Italy’s lieutenant in Naples. From 1866 to 1867 he fought in the Italian war against Austria as Garibaldi’s chief of staff. Thereafter, he limited his activity to the Italian parliament, where he worked diligently to maintain unity among the quarrelling leftist leaders. Nicola Fabrizi",

Nicolás Bravo, (born c. 1786, Chilpancingo, Mex.—
died 1854, Chilpancingo), soldier and statesman, one
of the founders of republican Mexico, serving as its
president or acting president at various times.
Bravo and his family joined the peasant leader José
María Morelos y Pavón and his band in 1811 and thus became one of the first of the
wealthy Creole families (i.e., of Spanish origin but born in Mexico) to support the war
against Spain. Bravo commanded the Mexican forces during the War of Independence
against Spain (1810–21). He then joined the first independent government of Mexico, that
of Agustín de Iturbide (1821–23), as a member of the executive group that founded the
Republic of the United Mexican States (1823). Bravo served as a vice president of the
Republic (1824–27) and as president for a time during the 1830s. During the Mexican-
American War (1846–48), he also was at times acting president, as well as commander of
the departments of Puebla, Veracruz, Oaxaca, and Tabasco. He was in command of the
fortress of Chapultepec outside Mexico City when it was captured by U.S. forces in 1847.

Norodom Sihanouk
Norodom Sihanouk; Kennedy,
John F., 1961
Norodom Sihanouk
Norodom Sihanouk, in full Preah Bat Samdech
Preah Norodom Sihanouk, (born October 31, 1922,
Phnom Penh, Cambodia—died October 15, 2012,
Beijing, China), twice king of Cambodia (1941–55
and 1993–2004), who also served as prime minister,
head of state, and president. He attempted to steer a
neutral course for Cambodia in its civil and foreign
wars of the late 20th century.
Sihanouk was, on his mother’s side, the grandson of King Monivong (reigned 1927–41),
whom he succeeded to the throne at age 18. At the time Cambodia was a French
protectorate, and Sihanouk wielded little power. However, near the end of World War II,
the occupying Japanese encouraged the young king to declare Cambodia’s independence
from France. When French military forces moved back into the region, Sihanouk decided
to wait until France’s retreat from Indochina, which occurred in 1954. He founded the
Sangkum Reastr Niyum (“People’s Socialist Community”) in January 1955, won a
referendum in February approving its program, and on March 2 abdicated in favour of his
father, Norodom Suramarit, becoming the new monarch’s prime minister, foreign minister,
and subsequently permanent representative to the United Nations. Five years later, after the
death of his father (April 3, 1960), he accepted the role of head of state (June 13).
Sihanouk steered a neutralist course in his foreign
policy. In return for a North Vietnamese pledge to
respect Cambodia’s frontiers, he allowed Vietnamese
communists to operate covertly from bases inside
eastern Cambodia. He subsequently rejected U.S. aid
and assistance, relying on his immense popularity
with the Cambodian people to keep radicals of both
the right and the left under control. Under Sihanouk’s
benign rule, Cambodia experienced 15 years of fragile peace and mild prosperity while
much of Southeast Asia was in a state of upheaval.
Sihanouk’s maintenance of Cambodian neutrality in the Vietnam War ended in 1970 when
he was ousted in a U.S.-supported coup led by General Lon Nol. He then lived in Beijing
as the titular head of a government-in-exile.

Following the Khmer Rouge takeover of Cambodia in 1975, Sihanouk returned home only
to be put under house arrest. Under dictator Pol Pot, a four-year reign of terror ensued
during which more than one million Cambodians were killed. Sihanouk was released in
January 1979 because the Khmer Rouge regime was falling to Vietnamese military forces
and needed an advocate in the United Nations. After denouncing the Vietnamese invasion,
he dissociated himself from the Khmer Rouge. From residences in China and North Korea,
Sihanouk became president of an uneasy coalition government-in-exile made up of the
three principal anti-Vietnamese Khmer forces—the Khmer Rouge, the anticommunist
Khmer People’s National Liberation Front, and Sihanouk’s neutralist party. He retained his
role as resistance leader until 1991, when he was elected president of Cambodia’s Supreme
National Council, an interim administrative body.
In September 1993, following UN-sponsored elections the previous May, Cambodia’s
National Assembly voted to restore the monarchy, and Sihanouk once again became king.
His son, Norodom Ranariddh, served as first prime minister until 1997, when he was
overthrown in a coup by Hun Sen, who nevertheless left Sihanouk on the throne.
In later years Sihanouk retreated from politics to work as a filmmaker and composer. He
abdicated on October 7, 2004, and his son Norodom Sihamoni, chosen to succeed him, was
crowned king on October 29.

Oginga Odinga
Oginga Odinga, in full Jaramogi Ajuma Oginga Odinga, (born October 1911, Sakwa,
Central Nyanza, East Africa Protectorate [now in Kenya]—died Jan. 20, 1994, Kisumu,
Kenya), African nationalist politician who was a leader in the opposition against the single-
party rule of Jomo Kenyatta and his successor, Daniel arap Moi.
Odinga was a member of Kenya’s second largest ethnic group, the Luo. Like many other
prominent East Africans, he was educated at Makerere University College in Kampala,
Ugan., and he was originally a teacher. From the late 1940s Odinga was an associate of
Kenyatta’s in the campaign for Kenya’s independence from Britain; he was active in
recruiting Luo support for the movement. From 1952 to 1957 he was president of the Luo
Union, a political and social organization, and in 1957 he was elected to the Legislative
Council as member for Central Nyanza. In 1960 he became vice president of the newly
formed Kenya African National Union (KANU).
Odinga was elected a member of the House of Representatives in 1963, and, when Kenya
became independent in December of that year, he became minister for home affairs (1963–
64) and then vice president. His socialist views conflicted with Kenyatta’s more centrist
ideology, however, and in 1966 he broke away from KANU to form a left-wing opposition
party, the Kenya People’s Union (KPU). The KPU was outlawed by Kenyatta in 1969, and
some of its members, including Odinga, were placed under government detention. After his
release in 1971, Odinga rejoined KANU, but he never regained Kenyatta’s confidence, and
he was not permitted to run for parliament.
Odinga’s exclusion from parliament continued under Moi, who became president in 1978.
Odinga continued to criticize government corruption and to press for improved human
rights and a multiparty political system. He was expelled from KANU in 1982 and
imprisoned for several months, but he remained the most popular politician among the Luo,
most of whom regarded him as their national leader. In 1987 Odinga increased his
opposition to the government’s policies, and in 1991 he helped found the Forum for the
Restoration of Democracy (FORD). Later that year, under pressure at home and from the
international community, Moi legalized opposition parties. Ethnic and personal rivalries
split FORD, however, and Odinga came in fourth in multiparty presidential elections held
in 1992.

Odinga’s son, Raila Odinga, also became an active player in Kenyan politics, lending key
support to several prominent political leaders. He ran for president in an election held in
December 2007; the incumbent, Mwai Kibaki, was declared the winner despite many
instances of voting irregularities. Raila Odinga and many Kenyans disputed the outcome,
and the country was gripped by chaos and violence. A power-sharing agreement brokered
two months later called for the formation of a coalition government in which Odinga was
to hold the newly created position of prime minister.

Omar Said Tjokroaminoto
Omar Said Tjokroaminoto, (born Aug. 16, 1882, Desa Bakur, Madiun, Java—died Dec.
17, 1934, Jogjakarta), highly influential Indonesian leader of the early Indonesian
nationalist movement, closely linked with the Sarekat Islām (Islāmic Association), which
he shaped as a political force.
The Sarekat Dagang Islām (Association of Islāmic Traders), established in 1911 to promote
the interests of Indonesian traders faced with growing Chinese competition, was
reorganized as Sarekat Islām the following year by Tjokroaminoto. He broadened the focus
of the group, greatly expanding its appeal, and organized it along Western lines. There
were, however, substantial non-Western elements.
Tjokroaminoto, who had a powerful personality, became widely popular among Javanese
peasants. By 1914 he had become the central figure of a messianic movement, and the
Sarekat Islām had taken on strong mystical overtones. He was not a strong leader, however,
and he failed to reinforce his popular appeal with a clear, consistent policy. His concern for
the need for unity against Dutch rule led him to make compromises, while other groups
with more coherent programs were politically more effective. In 1918 he became a member
of the Volksraad.
In the early years of Sarekat Islām, Tjokroaminoto came into contact with a number of
young nationalists, among whom was Sukarno, who became the first president of
Indonesia. Tjokroaminoto tutored Sukarno, who also married his daughter. After 1920
Tjokroaminoto’s fortunes declined. He was jailed by the Dutch in 1921 on a charge of
perjury but was released in 1922. By 1923 Sukarno, who had ended his marriage, had
broken politically with Tjokroaminoto and adopted a more radical position. They were later
reconciled, and in 1926 Sukarno wrote for Bandera Islām (“Flag of Islām”), a journal
edited by Tjokroaminoto after his release from prison. But his passive and conciliatory
positions prevented Tjokroaminoto from ever regaining the power and influence he had
held in the early days of Sarekat Islām.

both Bohemia’s autonomy from the German king and the hereditary rights to the Bohemian
crown for his house of Přemysl.
Initially confirmed as duke of Bohemia in 1192 by the Holy Roman emperor Henry VI,
Otakar was deposed the following year but subsequently regained possession of the fief of
Bohemia in 1197. He obtained the title of king in 1198 and almost total autonomy for
Bohemia from the emperor Philip of Swabia. His title was subsequently confirmed by the
emperor Frederick II (1212), who thereby all but extinguished the control of the empire in
Bohemian affairs. Otakar’s reign thus established the basis of a strong Bohemian state,
which was to reach the height of its power later in the 13th century.

Pasquale Paoli, (born April 26, 1725, Stretta di
Morosaglia, Corsica—died Feb. 5, 1807, London),
Corsican statesman and patriot who was responsible
for ending Genoese rule of Corsica and for
establishing enlightened rule and reforms.
The son of Giacinto Paoli, who led the Corsicans
against Genoa from 1735, Pasquale followed his father into exile at Naples in 1739,
studying at the military academy there and preparing to continue the fight for Corsican
independence. In 1755 he returned to Corsica and, after overcoming the Genoese faction,
was elected to executive power under a constitution more democratic than any other in
Europe. For the next nine years, under the principles of enlightened despotism, he
transformed Corsica, first by suppressing the system of vendetta and substituting order and
justice, then by encouraging mining, building up a naval fleet, and instituting national
schools and a university. At the same time he continued the war, first against Genoa and
after 1764 against Genoa’s ally, France. France bought Corsica in 1768 and invaded the
island and defeated the nationalists in 1769. Paoli fled to England, received a pension from
George III, and lived in London for the next 20 years.
Appointed lieutenant general and military commandant during the French Revolution,
Paoli returned to Corsica in July 1790. Breaking with France in 1793, he once more led the
fight for independence and, with British naval support, expelled the French in 1794. He
then offered the sovereignty of Corsica to George III, who accepted and sent Sir Gilbert
Elliot as viceroy. Elliot in turn chose not Paoli but Pozzo di Borgo as his chief adviser.
Disappointed and not wishing to cause internal strife, Paoli retired to England in 1795,
where he received a British government pension.

Sicilies—died Dec. 26, 1888, Rome), leader of the Risorgimento in the Kingdom of the
Two Sicilies, who played a prominent role in the government of united Italy.
As a deputy in the Neapolitan parliament of 1848–49 and as a journalist and lawyer,
Mancini fought for democracy and constitutionalism until forced into exile by the
reactionary Bourbon government. Accepting a professorship at the University of Turin, he
continued to be an active propagandist for national unity; after election to the parliament of
Piedmont–Sardinia in 1860, he was sent (1861) to join the council presiding over the
territory of his former homeland in the south, newly conquered by the Italian patriot
Giuseppe Garibaldi. There he suppressed the religious orders, renounced the concordat
with the papacy, and proclaimed the state’s right to church property.
Returning to Turin, he sat with the centre in the first parliament of united Italy and served
briefly in the cabinet. In 1865 he won a great personal triumph in convincing parliament to
put substantial limitations on capital punishment. He served as minister of justice (1876–
78) and as acting minister of public worship in 1878, when he gave the assurances
necessary for a conclave of cardinals to elect a pope for the first time since Rome became a
part of a united Italy (1871). He became minister of foreign affairs (1881) under Agostino
Depretis. In an effort to gain support for Italian colonial expansion in Africa, he pursued a
policy of rapprochement with Austria, leading to Italy’s joining the Triple Alliance with
Austria Hungary and Germany in 1882. Public discontent with the lack of immediate gains
from his policy led to his resignation in June 1885.

Patrice Lumumba
Patrice Lumumba
Patrice Lumumba, in full Patrice Hemery
Lumumba, (born July 2, 1925, Onalua, Belgian
Congo [now Democratic Republic of the Congo]—
died January 17, 1961, Katanga province), African
nationalist leader, the first prime minister of the
Democratic Republic of the Congo (June–September
1960). Forced out of office during a political crisis, he
was assassinated a short time later.
Early life, education, and work
Lumumba was born in the village of Onalua in Kasai province, Belgian Congo. He was a
member of the small Batetela ethnic group, a fact that became significant in his later
political life. His two principal rivals, Moise Tshombe, who led the breakaway of the
Katanga province, and Joseph Kasavubu, who later became the Congo’s president, both
came from large, powerful ethnic groups from which they derived their major support,
giving their political movements a regional character. In contrast, Lumumba’s movement
emphasized its all-Congolese nature.
After attending a Protestant mission school, Lumumba went to work in Kindu-Port-
Empain, where he became active in the club of the évolués (Western-educated Africans).
He began to write essays and poems for Congolese journals. He also applied for and
received full Belgian citizenship. Lumumba next moved to Léopoldville (now Kinshasa) to
become a postal clerk and went on to become an accountant in the post office in
Stanleyville (now Kisangani). There he continued to contribute to the Congolese press.
Entry into politics
In 1955 Lumumba became regional president of a purely Congolese trade union of
government employees that was not affiliated, as were other unions, to either of the two
Belgian trade-union federations (socialist and Roman Catholic). He also became active in
the Belgian Liberal Party in the Congo. Although conservative in many ways, the party was
not linked to either of the trade-union federations, which were hostile to it. In 1956
Lumumba was invited with others on a study tour of Belgium under the auspices of the
minister of colonies. On his return he was arrested on a charge of embezzlement from the
1/16/23, 2:40 PM
Patrice Lumumba -- Britannica Online Encyclopedia
https://www.britannica.com/print/article/351310
2/4
post office. He was convicted and condemned one year later, after various reductions of
sentence, to 12 months’ imprisonment and a fine.
When Lumumba got out of prison, he grew even more active in politics. In October 1958
he, along with other Congolese leaders, launched the Congolese National Movement
(Mouvement National Congolais; MNC), the first nationwide Congolese political party. In
December he attended the first All-African People’s Conference in Accra, Ghana, where he
met nationalists from across the African continent and was made a member of the
permanent organization set up by the conference. His outlook and vocabulary, inspired by
pan-African goals, now took on the tenor of militant nationalism.
As nationalist fervour increased, the Belgian government announced a program intended to
lead to independence for the Congo, starting with local elections in December 1959. The
nationalists regarded this program as a scheme to install puppets before independence and
announced a boycott of the elections. The Belgian authorities responded with repression.
On October 30 there was a clash in Stanleyville that resulted in 30 deaths. Lumumba was
imprisoned on a charge of inciting to riot.
The MNC decided to shift tactics, entered the elections, and won a sweeping victory in
Stanleyville (90 percent of the votes). In January 1960 the Belgian government convened a
Round Table Conference in Brussels of all Congolese parties to discuss political change,
but the MNC refused to participate without Lumumba. Lumumba was thereupon released
from prison and flown to Brussels. The conference agreed on a date for independence, June
30, with national elections in May. Although there was a multiplicity of parties, the MNC
came out far ahead in the elections, and Lumumba emerged as the leading nationalist
politician of the Congo. Maneuvers to prevent his assumption of authority failed, and he
was asked to form the first government, which he did on June 24, 1960.
Prime ministership
Almost immediately after the June 30 independence date, some units of the army rebelled,
largely because of objections to their Belgian commander. Moise Tshombe took advantage
of the ensuing confusion, using it as an opportunity to proclaim that the mineral-rich
province of Katanga was seceding from the Congo. Belgium sent in troops, ostensibly to
protect Belgian nationals in the disorder, but the Belgian troops landed principally in
Katanga, where they sustained Tshombe’s secessionist regime.
The Congo appealed to the United Nations to expel the Belgians and help them restore
internal order. As prime minister, Lumumba did what little he could to redress the situation.

His army was an uncertain instrument of power, his civilian administration untrained and
untried; the United Nations forces (whose presence he had requested) were condescending
and assertive, and the political alliances underlying his regime very shaky. The Belgian
troops did not leave, and the Katanga secession continued.
Since the United Nations forces refused to help suppress the Katangese revolt, Lumumba
appealed to the Soviet Union for planes to assist in transporting his troops to Katanga. He
asked the independent African states to meet in Léopoldville in August to unite their efforts
behind him. His moves alarmed many, particularly the Western powers and the supporters
of President Kasavubu, who pursued a moderate course in the coalition government and
favoured some local autonomy in the provinces.
Dismissal, arrest, and assassination
On September 5 President Kasavubu dismissed Lumumba, but the legalities of the move
were immediately contested by Lumumba; as a result of the discord, there were two groups
now claiming to be the legal central government. On September 14 power was seized by
the Congolese army leader Col. Joseph Mobutu (later president of Zaire as Mobutu Sese
Seko), who later reached a working agreement with Kasavubu. In November the General
Assembly of the United Nations (UN) recognized the credentials of Kasavubu’s
government. The independent African states split sharply over the issue.
Meanwhile, in October, Lumumba had been placed under house arrest in Léopoldville,
guarded not only by Mobutu’s forces but by those of the UN as well, which provided him
with protection. After the General Assembly decided to recognize Kasavubu’s government,
Lumumba escaped from home confinement and sought to travel to Stanleyville, where his
supporters had control. However, he was caught by Mobutu’s forces and arrested on
December 2. Lumumba was initially held at a military camp in Thysville (now Mbanza-
Ngungu), but concerns that the soldiers there were sympathetic to him led Belgian,
Congolese, and Katangan authorities to arrange for his transfer to a different location that
they deemed to be more secure—and one that would almost certainly guarantee his death.
On January 17, 1961, Lumumba and two associates, Joseph Okito and Maurice Mpolo,
were flown to Elisabethville (now Lubumbashi), where they were delivered to the
secessionist regime in Katanga and its Belgian advisors. On the flight there, they had been
beaten by the soldiers escorting them, and, once they landed in Katanga, they were beaten
again. Later that day, Lumumba, Okito, and Mpolo were executed by a firing squad under
Belgian command. Although their bodies were initially thrown into shallow graves, they

were later dug up under the direction of Belgian officers, hacked into pieces, and dissolved
in acid or burned by fire.
The Katangan government withheld official announcement of his death until February 13
and then claimed that Lumumba had escaped from their custody and had been discovered
by villagers, who killed him. Rumours of Lumumba’s death had circulated soon after it
occurred, however. The government’s explanation of his death was quickly disputed,
although it would take decades for the full circumstances surrounding his death to be made
public. His death caused a scandal throughout Africa and beyond; retrospectively, even his
enemies proclaimed him a “national hero.”
Assessment
The reasons that Lumumba provoked such intense emotion are not immediately evident.
His viewpoint was not exceptional. He was for a unitary Congo and against division of the
country along ethnic or regional lines. Like many other African leaders, he supported pan-
Africanism and the liberation of colonial territories. He proclaimed his regime one of
“positive neutralism,” which he defined as a return to African values and rejection of any
imported ideology, including that of the Soviet Union.
Lumumba was, however, a man of strong character who intended to pursue his policies
regardless of the enemies he made within his country or abroad. The Congo, furthermore,
was a key area in terms of the geopolitics of Africa, and because of its wealth, size, and
proximity to white-dominated southern Africa, Lumumba’s opponents had reason to fear
the consequences of a radical or radicalized Congo regime. Moreover, in the context of the
Cold War, the Soviet Union’s support for Lumumba appeared at the time as a threat to
many in the West.

Cordell The Editors of Encyclopaedia Britannica']","Patrice Lumumba Patrice Lumumba, in full Patrice Hemery Lumumba, (born July 2, 1925, Onalua, Belgian Congo [now Democratic Republic of the Congo]— died January 17, 1961, Katanga province), African nationalist leader, the first prime minister of the Democratic Republic of the Congo (June–September 1960). Forced out of office during a political crisis, he was assassinated a short time later. Early life, education, and work Lumumba was born in the village of Onalua in Kasai province, Belgian Congo. He was a member of the small Batetela ethnic group, a fact that became significant in his later political life. His two principal rivals, Moise Tshombe, who led the breakaway of the Katanga province, and Joseph Kasavubu, who later became the Congo’s president, both came from large, powerful ethnic groups from which they derived their major support, giving their political movements a regional character. In contrast, Lumumba’s movement emphasized its all-Congolese nature. After attending a Protestant mission school, Lumumba went to work in Kindu-Port- Empain, where he became active in the club of the évolués (Western-educated Africans). He began to write essays and poems for Congolese journals. He also applied for and received full Belgian citizenship. Lumumba next moved to Léopoldville (now Kinshasa) to become a postal clerk and went on to become an accountant in the post office in Stanleyville (now Kisangani). There he continued to contribute to the Congolese press. Entry into politics In 1955 Lumumba became regional president of a purely Congolese trade union of government employees that was not affiliated, as were other unions, to either of the two Belgian trade-union federations (socialist and Roman Catholic). He also became active in the Belgian Liberal Party in the Congo. Although conservative in many ways, the party was not linked to either of the trade-union federations, which were hostile to it. In 1956 Lumumba was invited with others on a study tour of Belgium under the auspices of the minister of colonies. On his return he was arrested on a charge of embezzlement from the  Patrice Lumumba   post office. He was convicted and condemned one year later, after various reductions of sentence, to 12 months’ imprisonment and a fine. When Lumumba got out of prison, he grew even more active in politics. In October 1958 he, along with other Congolese leaders, launched the Congolese National Movement (Mouvement National Congolais; MNC), the first nationwide Congolese political party. In December he attended the first All-African People’s Conference in Accra, Ghana, where he met nationalists from across the African continent and was made a member of the permanent organization set up by the conference. His outlook and vocabulary, inspired by pan-African goals, now took on the tenor of militant nationalism. As nationalist fervour increased, the Belgian government announced a program intended to lead to independence for the Congo, starting with local elections in December 1959. The nationalists regarded this program as a scheme to install puppets before independence and announced a boycott of the elections. The Belgian authorities responded with repression. On October 30 there was a clash in Stanleyville that resulted in 30 deaths. Lumumba was imprisoned on a charge of inciting to riot. The MNC decided to shift tactics, entered the elections, and won a sweeping victory in Stanleyville (90 percent of the votes). In January 1960 the Belgian government convened a Round Table Conference in Brussels of all Congolese parties to discuss political change, but the MNC refused to participate without Lumumba. Lumumba was thereupon released from prison and flown to Brussels. The conference agreed on a date for independence, June 30, with national elections in May. Although there was a multiplicity of parties, the MNC came out far ahead in the elections, and Lumumba emerged as the leading nationalist politician of the Congo. Maneuvers to prevent his assumption of authority failed, and he was asked to form the first government, which he did on June 24, 1960. Prime ministership Almost immediately after the June 30 independence date, some units of the army rebelled, largely because of objections to their Belgian commander. Moise Tshombe took advantage of the ensuing confusion, using it as an opportunity to proclaim that the mineral-rich province of Katanga was seceding from the Congo. Belgium sent in troops, ostensibly to protect Belgian nationals in the disorder, but the Belgian troops landed principally in Katanga, where they sustained Tshombe’s secessionist regime. The Congo appealed to the United Nations to expel the Belgians and help them restore internal order. As prime minister, Lumumba did what little he could to redress the situation. Patrice Lumumba   His army was an uncertain instrument of power, his civilian administration untrained and untried; the United Nations forces (whose presence he had requested) were condescending and assertive, and the political alliances underlying his regime very shaky. The Belgian troops did not leave, and the Katanga secession continued. Since the United Nations forces refused to help suppress the Katangese revolt, Lumumba appealed to the Soviet Union for planes to assist in transporting his troops to Katanga. He asked the independent African states to meet in Léopoldville in August to unite their efforts behind him. His moves alarmed many, particularly the Western powers and the supporters of President Kasavubu, who pursued a moderate course in the coalition government and favoured some local autonomy in the provinces. Dismissal, arrest, and assassination On September 5 President Kasavubu dismissed Lumumba, but the legalities of the move were immediately contested by Lumumba; as a result of the discord, there were two groups now claiming to be the legal central government. On September 14 power was seized by the Congolese army leader Col. Joseph Mobutu (later president of Zaire as Mobutu Sese Seko), who later reached a working agreement with Kasavubu. In November the General Assembly of the United Nations (UN) recognized the credentials of Kasavubu’s government. The independent African states split sharply over the issue. Meanwhile, in October, Lumumba had been placed under house arrest in Léopoldville, guarded not only by Mobutu’s forces but by those of the UN as well, which provided him with protection. After the General Assembly decided to recognize Kasavubu’s government, Lumumba escaped from home confinement and sought to travel to Stanleyville, where his supporters had control. However, he was caught by Mobutu’s forces and arrested on December 2. Lumumba was initially held at a military camp in Thysville (now Mbanza- Ngungu), but concerns that the soldiers there were sympathetic to him led Belgian, Congolese, and Katangan authorities to arrange for his transfer to a different location that they deemed to be more secure—and one that would almost certainly guarantee his death. On January 17, 1961, Lumumba and two associates, Joseph Okito and Maurice Mpolo, were flown to Elisabethville (now Lubumbashi), where they were delivered to the secessionist regime in Katanga and its Belgian advisors. On the flight there, they had been beaten by the soldiers escorting them, and, once they landed in Katanga, they were beaten again. Later that day, Lumumba, Okito, and Mpolo were executed by a firing squad under Belgian command. Although their bodies were initially thrown into shallow graves, they  Patrice Lumumba   were later dug up under the direction of Belgian officers, hacked into pieces, and dissolved in acid or burned by fire. The Katangan government withheld official announcement of his death until February 13 and then claimed that Lumumba had escaped from their custody and had been discovered by villagers, who killed him. Rumours of Lumumba’s death had circulated soon after it occurred, however. The government’s explanation of his death was quickly disputed, although it would take decades for the full circumstances surrounding his death to be made public. His death caused a scandal throughout Africa and beyond; retrospectively, even his enemies proclaimed him a “national hero.” Assessment The reasons that Lumumba provoked such intense emotion are not immediately evident. His viewpoint was not exceptional. He was for a unitary Congo and against division of the country along ethnic or regional lines. Like many other African leaders, he supported pan- Africanism and the liberation of colonial territories. He proclaimed his regime one of “positive neutralism,” which he defined as a return to African values and rejection of any imported ideology, including that of the Soviet Union. Lumumba was, however, a man of strong character who intended to pursue his policies regardless of the enemies he made within his country or abroad. The Congo, furthermore, was a key area in terms of the geopolitics of Africa, and because of its wealth, size, and proximity to white-dominated southern Africa, Lumumba’s opponents had reason to fear the consequences of a radical or radicalized Congo regime. Moreover, in the context of the Cold War, the Soviet Union’s support for Lumumba appeared at the time as a threat to many in the West. Immanuel Wallerstein Dennis D.

Henry, Patrick: in the House of
Burgesses
Patrick Henry
Patrick Henry, (born May 29 [May 18, Old Style],
1736, Studley [Virginia]—died June 6, 1799, Red
Hill, near Brookneal, Virginia, U.S.), brilliant orator
and a major figure of the American Revolution,
perhaps best known for his words “Give me liberty or
give me death!” which he delivered in 1775. He was
independent Virginia’s first governor (serving 1776–
79, 1784–86).
Patrick Henry was the son of John Henry, a well-educated Scotsman who served in the
colony as a surveyor, colonel, and justice of the Hanover County Court. Before he was 10,
Patrick received some rudimentary education in a local school, later reinforced by tutoring
from his father, who was trained in the classics. As a youth, he failed twice in seven years
as a storekeeper and once as a farmer; and during this period he increased his
responsibilities by marriage, in 1754, to Sarah Shelton. The demands of a growing family
spurred him to study for the practice of law, and in this profession he soon displayed
remarkable ability. Within a few years after his admission to the bar in 1760 he had a large
and profitable clientele. He was especially successful in criminal cases, where he made
good use of his quick wit, his knowledge of human nature, and his forensic gifts.
Meanwhile, his oratorical genius had been revealed in the trial known as the Parson’s
Cause (1763). This suit grew out of the Virginia law, disallowed by King George III, that
permitted payment of the Anglican clergy in money instead of tobacco when the tobacco
crop was poor. Henry astonished the audience in the courtroom with his eloquence in
invoking the doctrine of natural rights, the political theory that man is born with certain
inalienable rights.
Two years later, at the capitol in Williamsburg, where
he had just been seated as a member of the House of
Burgesses (the lower house of the colonial
legislature), he delivered a speech opposing the
British Stamp Act. The act was a revenue law
requiring certain colonial publications and documents
to bear a legal stamp. Henry offered a series of
resolutions asserting the right of the colonies to

legislate independently of the British Parliament, and he supported these resolutions with
great eloquence: “Caesar had his Brutus, Charles the First his Cromwell, and George III…”
Here he was interrupted by cries of “Treason! treason!” But he concluded, according to a
likely version, “…may profit by their example. If this be treason, make the most of it.”
During the next decade Henry was an influential
leader in the radical opposition to the British
government. He was a member of the first Virginia
Committee of Correspondence, which aided
intercolonial cooperation, and a delegate to the
Continental Congresses of 1774 and 1775. At the
second Virginia Convention, on March 23, 1775, in
St. John’s Church, Richmond, he delivered the speech that assured his fame as one of the
great advocates of liberty. Convinced that war with Great Britain was inevitable, he
presented strong resolutions for equipping the Virginia militia to fight against the British
and defended them in a fiery speech with the famed peroration, “I know not what course
others may take, but as for me, give me liberty or give me death!”
The resolutions passed, and Henry was appointed commander of the Virginia forces, but his
actions were curbed by the Committee of Safety; in reaction, he resigned on February 28,
1776. Henry served on the committee in the Virginia Convention of 1776 that drafted the
first constitution for the state. He was elected governor the same year and was reelected in
1777 and 1778 for one-year terms, thereby serving continuously as long as the new
constitution permitted. As wartime governor, he gave Gen. George Washington able
support, and during his second term he authorized the expedition to invade the Illinois
country under the leadership of George Rogers Clark.
After the death of his first wife, Henry married Dorothea Dandridge and retired to life on
his estate in Henry county. He was recalled to public service as a leading member of the
state legislature from 1780 to 1784 and again from 1787 to 1790. From 1784 to 1786 he
served as governor. He declined to attend the Philadelphia Constitutional Convention of
1787 and in 1788 was the leading opponent of ratification of the U.S. Constitution at the
Virginia Convention. This action, which has aroused much controversy ever since, resulted
from his fear that the original document did not secure either the rights of the states or
those of individuals, as well as from his suspicion that the North would abandon to Spain
the vital right of navigation on the Mississippi River.

Henry was reconciled, however, to the new federal government, especially after the
passage of the Bill of Rights, for which he was in great measure responsible. Because of
family responsibilities and ill health, he declined a series of offers of high posts in the new
federal government. In 1799, however, he consented to run again for the state legislature,
where he wished to oppose the Kentucky and Virginia resolutions, which claimed that the
states could determine the constitutionality of federal laws. During his successful electoral
campaign, he made his last speech, a moving plea for American unity. He died at his home,
Red Hill, before he was to have taken the seat.

This action, which has aroused much controversy ever since, resulted from his fear that the original document did not secure either the rights of the states or those of individuals, as well as from his suspicion that the North would abandon to Spain the vital right of navigation on the Mississippi River. Patrick Henry   Henry was reconciled, however, to the new federal government, especially after the passage of the Bill of Rights, for which he was in great measure responsible. Because of family responsibilities and ill health, he declined a series of offers of high posts in the new federal government. In 1799, however, he consented to run again for the state legislature, where he wished to oppose the Kentucky and Virginia resolutions, which claimed that the states could determine the constitutionality of federal laws. During his successful electoral campaign, he made his last speech, a moving plea for American unity. He died at his home, Red Hill, before he was to have taken the seat. Robert Douthat Meade",

Patrick Pearse
Patrick Pearse, in full Patrick Henry Pearse,
Patrick also spelled in Irish Pádraic, (born November
10, 1879, Dublin, Ireland—died May 3, 1916,
Dublin), Irish nationalist leader, poet, and educator.
He was the first president of the provisional
government of the Irish republic proclaimed in
Dublin on April 24, 1916, and was commander in chief of the Irish forces in the anti-British
Easter Rising that began on the same day.
The son of an English sculptor and his Irish wife, Pearse became a director of the Gaelic
League (founded 1893 for the preservation of the Irish language) and edited (1903–09) its
weekly newspaper, An Claidheamh Soluis (“The Sword of Light”). To further promote the
Irish language as a weapon against British domination, he published tales from old Irish
manuscripts and a collection (1914) of his own poems in the modern Irish idiom. He
founded St. Enda’s College (1908), near Dublin, as a bilingual institution with its teaching
based on Irish traditions and culture.
On the formation of the Irish Volunteers (November 1913) as a counterforce against the
Ulster Volunteers (militant supporters of the Anglo-Irish union), Pearse became a member
of their provisional committee, and he contributed poems and articles to their newspaper,
The Irish Volunteer. In July 1914 he was made a member of the supreme council of the
Irish Republican Brotherhood (IRB). After the Irish Volunteers split (September 1914), he
became a leader of the more extreme nationalist section, which opposed any support for
Great Britain in World War I. He came to believe that the blood of martyrs would be
required to liberate Ireland, and on that theme he delivered a famous oration in August
1915 at the burial of Jeremiah O’Donovan, known as O’Donovan Rossa, a veteran of Sinn
Féin.
As early as spring 1915 Pearse, as an IRB supreme council member, helped to plan the
Easter Rising. On Easter Monday he proclaimed the provisional government of the Irish
republic from the steps of Dublin General Post Office. On April 29, when the revolt was
crushed, he surrendered to the British. After a court-martial, he was shot by a firing squad.
More than any other man, Pearse was responsible for establishing the republican tradition
in Ireland.

Pedro I
Pedro I
Pedro I, (born Oct. 12, 1798, Lisbon, Port.—died
Sept. 24, 1834, Lisbon), founder of the Brazilian
empire and first emperor of Brazil, from Dec. 1,
1822, to April 7, 1831, also reckoned as King Pedro
(Peter) IV of Portugal.
Generally known as Dom Pedro, he was the son of
King John VI of Portugal. When Napoleon conquered Portugal in 1807, Pedro
accompanied the royal family in its flight to Brazil. He remained there as regent when King
John returned to Portugal in 1821.
Pedro surrounded himself with ministers who counseled independence. When the
Portuguese Cortês (Parliament), preferring colonial status for Brazil, demanded that Pedro
return to Lisbon to “complete his political education,” he issued a declaration of Brazilian
independence on Sept. 7, 1822. Within three months he was crowned emperor.
Pedro’s initial popularity waned, and in 1823, when the Brazilian Assembly was preparing
a liberal constitution, he dissolved that body and exiled the radical leader José Bonifácio de
Andrada e Silva. On March 25, 1824, however, Pedro accepted a somewhat less liberal
constitution drafted by the Council of State at his behest.
Although adoption of that charter may have saved Pedro from deposition, it did not
reestablish his popularity. His autocratic manner, his lack of enthusiasm for parliamentary
government, and his continuing deep interest in Portuguese affairs antagonized his subjects,
as did the failure of his military forces in a war with Argentina over what is now Uruguay.
Strong opposition in the Brazilian Parliament and a series of local uprisings induced him to
abdicate in 1831 in favour of his son Dom Pedro II, who was then five years old. Pedro I
then returned to Portugal.
On the death of King John VI (March 10, 1826), Pedro I had become titular king of
Portugal as Pedro IV. Two months later, still in Brazil, he issued a parliamentary charter for
Portugal and conditionally abdicated the Portuguese throne in favour of his daughter Maria
da Glória, the future Queen Maria II. He died of natural causes in Portugal while securing
his daughter’s claim against that of his brother, the regent Miguel.

Pehr Evind Svinhufvud
Pehr Evind Svinhufvud, (born Dec. 15, 1861,
Sääksmäki, Fin.—died Feb. 29, 1944, Luumäki), first
chief of state of independent Finland, as prime
minister and then as president. He headed the Finnish
government during his country’s civil war (1918) and
in the early 1930s. He was instrumental in
suppressing Finland’s Communist Party and maintaining a rightist regime.
Svinhufvud entered the Finnish Parliament in 1894, while Finland was still part of the
Russian Empire. His anti-Russian position earned him exile in Siberia from 1914 to 1917.
Having returned at the outbreak of the Russian Revolution of March 1917, he became
prime minister of Finland, on November 27. He led the victorious “White” government
during the Finnish Civil War of 1918 and secured (with German aid) Finland’s
independence from Soviet Russia. Being pro-German, he resigned after Germany’s defeat
in World War I and entered the conservative National Coalition Party. As prime minister
from July 5, 1930, to Feb. 16, 1931, and president from March 2, 1931, to Feb. 28, 1937,
he aided the rightist Lapua Movement in the suppression of the Communist Party but
resisted efforts to turn Finland into an authoritarian, antidemocratic state.

Peter Carington, 6th Baron Carrington
Peter Carington, 6th Baron Carrington, in full Peter Alexander Rupert Carington, 6th
Baron Carrington of Upton, Baron Carrington of Bulcot Lodge, (born June 6, 1919,
London, England—died July 9, 2018), British politician who was secretary-general of the
North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) from 1984 to 1988. He previously held posts
in the administrations of various Conservative prime ministers, notably serving as foreign
secretary (1979–82) under Margaret Thatcher.
He was born Peter Alexander Rupert Carington; the family’s name was spelled Carington
but their hereditary title was spelled Carrington. After graduating from Eton College, he
attended the Royal Military Academy (Sandhurst). Following his father’s death in 1938,
Peter assumed his title and later took his seat in the House of Lords. Carrington served in
World War II and was awarded the Military Cross (1945). He subsequently became a junior
agricultural minister under Winston Churchill. In 1954 he was involved in the Crichel
Down affair, in which the Department of Agriculture was heavily criticized for failing to
return land that it had acquired by compulsory purchase during the war. The department’s
secretary stepped down, but Carrington’s resignation was rejected by Churchill.
Carrington served as high commissioner to Australia from 1956 until 1959, when Harold
Macmillan appointed him first lord of the Admiralty. In 1963 he entered Alec Douglas-
Home’s cabinet and, after the Conservative defeat in the general election of 1964, led the
opposition in the House of Lords. With the Conservatives back in power in 1970, he
became defense secretary and in 1974, in the last days of the Edward Heath government,
energy secretary.
When a Conservative government under Margaret Thatcher was formed in 1979,
Carrington became foreign secretary. His charm and diplomatic skills enabled him to
achieve a negotiated independence for Rhodesia (now Zimbabwe) and an end to the bloody
civil war there in 1979–80. He then turned his attention to the Middle East and at the same
time sought negotiated solutions to Britain’s residual colonial problems. In April 1982 he
resigned his post after misreading the intentions of the Argentine government regarding the
Falkland Islands (Islas Malvinas; see Falkland Islands War). Although an inquiry later
found him to be not at fault, his acceptance of responsibility drew high praise.
Carrington became secretary-general of NATO in June 1984. He emphasized the
importance of communication with the Soviet Union, believing that issue to be central to

the restoration of public confidence in NATO. After leaving the organization in 1988,
Carrington remained active. In the early 1990s he notably was involved in negotiations to
secure the peaceful dissolution of Yugoslavia, though the plan he helped draft was
ultimately rejected. In 1999 hereditary peers were removed from the House of Lords, and
Carrington was subsequently made a life peer. He wrote the memoir Reflect on Things Past
(1988).

Peter I
Peter I, Montenegrin in full Petar Petrović Njegoš, (born c. 1747, Njeguši, Montenegro—
died October 18 [October 30, New Style], 1830, Cetinje), the great vladika, or prince-
bishop, of Montenegro from 1782 to 1830, who won full independence of his country from
the Turks.
As successor to his saintly but inept uncle Sava, Peter became the reigning prince in
theocratic Montenegro in 1782 and was consecrated bishop two years later. To cement
relations with Russia, always a potential ally against the Turks, he visited Russia that same
year. On his return he found his land was being overrun by the forces of the pasha of
Scutari. Uniting his warlike clans, he drove the invaders out. War with the Turks flared up
periodically, sometimes with, and sometimes without, a powerful ally such as Russia or
Austria. In 1796 a second invasion by the pasha of Scutari led to a series of brilliant
victories over the Turks, with Peter leading his men. The pasha was captured and beheaded,
and by a treaty in 1799 Sultan Selim III was forced to recognize the independence of
Montenegro. New territories were added, including Brda, recently settled by Serbs from
Hercegovina, which was to double the size of Montenegro during Peter’s reign.
During the Napoleonic Wars, Montenegro became involved in the struggle between the
great powers. When by the Treaty of Pressburg with Austria (1805) the French took over
Dalmatia, Peter allied himself first with the Russians until 1807 and then with the British in
1813 to maintain Montenegrin occupation of the town and Gulf of Kotor. After the French
left in 1813, the territory was annexed by Peter (October 1813), and Kotor became his
capital for a year. At the Congress of Vienna (1815), however, the land was returned to
Austria. In Peter’s last years as ruler, he was involved in more wars with the Turks (1819
and 1821) and in settling blood feuds among his mountaineers; his efforts further enhanced
his reputation as a just prince.

Phan Boi Chau
Phan Boi Chau, also called Phan Giai San, Phan Sao Nam, Phan Thi Han, or Hai Thu,
original name Phan Van San, (born 1867, Nghe An province, northern Vietnam—died
Sept. 29, 1940, Hue), dominant personality of early Vietnamese resistance movements,
whose impassioned writings and tireless schemes for independence earned him the
reverence of his people as one of Vietnam’s greatest patriots.
Phan Boi Chau was the son of a poor scholar, who stressed education and preparation for
the mandarin examinations, the only means to success in the traditional bureaucracy. By
the time he received his doctorate in 1900 Chau had become a firm nationalist.
In 1903 he wrote Luu cau huyet le tan thu (“Ryukyu’s Bitter Tears”), an allegory equating
Japan’s bitterness at the loss of the Ryukyu Islands with the Vietnamese loss of
independence. With fellow revolutionaries he formed the Duy Tan Hoi (“Reformation
Society”; see Duy Tan) in 1904 and secured the active support of Prince Cuong De, thus
presenting to the people an alliance of royalty and resistance.
In 1905 Chau moved his resistance movement to Japan, and in 1906 he met the Chinese
revolutionary Sun Yat-sen. His plans to place Cuong De on the throne of Vietnam resulted
in a meeting in 1906 with the prince and the Vietnamese reformer Phan Chau Trinh. A
Franco-Japanese understanding forced Chau, the Vietnamese students he had brought to
Japan, and Cuong De to leave Japan in 1908–09. By 1912 Chau had reluctantly given up
his monarchist scheme. He reorganized the resistance movement in Canton, China, under
the name Viet Nam Quang Phuc Hoi (“Vietnam Restoration Society”). The organization
launched a plan to assassinate the French governor-general of Indochina, but the plan
failed. Chau was imprisoned in Canton from 1914 to 1917; during his confinement he
wrote Nguc trung thu (“Prison Notes”), a short autobiography.
Upon his release, Chau studied Marxist doctrine and resumed his resistance to the French.
In June 1925 he was seized and taken to Hanoi, but hundreds of Vietnamese protested
against his arrest. The French pardoned him and offered him a civil service position that he
refused.
Chau lived out his later years in quiet retirement at Hue, under French surveillance. He
wrote a second autobiography, replete with directives for future revolutionaries, and several
volumes of poetry. Among his notable works are Viet Nam vong quoc su (1906; “History of

Phan Chau Trinh
Phan Chau Trinh, also spelled Phan Chu Trinh, (born 1872, Tay Loc, Quang Nam
province, Vietnam—died March 24, 1926, Saigon), nationalist leader and reformer who
played a vital role in the movement for Vietnamese independence and who was the leading
proponent of a reformist program that joined the aims of expelling the French and of
restructuring Vietnamese society.
Trained in military skills by his father, Phan Chau Trinh fought in 1885 against French
forces that were searching for the fugitive rebel king Ham Nghi, the symbol of the
resistance. In an encounter with the French, his father was killed, possibly by a member of
a nationalist-royalist organization who thought him a traitor. Thereafter, Trinh would not
associate with any plans to oppose the French that involved a monarchist symbol.
Trinh resumed his education in 1887, studying the Chinese classics in preparation for the
mandarin examinations, which he passed in 1900. By 1906 he had come to view the
mandarin bureaucracy and the Vietnamese monarchy as symbols of a backwardness that
would forever prevent technological progress and the development of an autonomous state.
That year he went to Japan, where he discussed plans for overthrowing the French regime
with another Vietnamese nationalist, Phan Boi Chau (q.v.). Trinh argued for the gradual
development of an autonomous state by laying firm foundations in economic and industrial
development. His primary goal was modernization, from which he believed a Vietnamese
democratic republic would follow.
Returning to Vietnam, Trinh started small business enterprises and spread propaganda
encouraging the development of local industries and a modern education for all
Vietnamese. Gaining a large following, he tried to persuade the French to undertake major
reforms, and he urged replacing the mandarin civil service system with vocational schools
and commercial firms. He asked wealthy Vietnamese to develop national commerce
through personal investments.
Greatly influenced by the writings of Jean-Jacques Rousseau and Montesquieu, Trinh
began by appealing in vain to French colonialists in terms of their own revolutionary
tradition. In 1908 he was seized in Hanoi during a series of arrests of anticolonialist
agitators. He maintained a silent protest through a hunger strike while awaiting trial at Hue.
After a trial in a joint mandarin and French court, Trinh was sentenced in May 1908 to life
imprisonment on Poulo Condore (now Con Son). He was pardoned and released in 1911,

however, apparently to work with the colonial regime for modernization. Subsidized by the
French, he went to Paris; he was again imprisoned early in World War I, this time for draft
evasion and pro-German leanings. He was released in 1915 but received no more subsidies
from the French. Trinh returned to Vietnam in 1924 and died of tuberculosis in 1926. He
was mourned by Vietnamese of all classes in a national funeral ceremony that lasted a

Vietnam and became a leader of the nationalist resistance movement.
Phan was a mandarin at the court of the Vietnamese emperor Tu Duc. After Tu Duc’s death
in 1883, Phan opposed the succession of the emperor’s nephew Ham Nghi. Ham Nghi
ascended the throne in 1884, however, and Phan was condemned to death by his enemies at
the court; the sentence was later commuted to banishment. Ham Nghi became the youthful
figurehead leader of an unsuccessful rebellion against the French in 1885.
By 1894 Phan led another rebellion that failed because of inadequate support. Phan and his
fellow revolutionaries were forced to retreat to the mountains of Nghe Tinh province. In
July 1895 the French sent 3,000 troops to Nghe Tinh, but Phan’s resistance movement held
out for several months. At the end of the year, Phan died of dysentery, and the remainder of
his followers were caught and executed.

Philibert Berthelier
Philibert Berthelier, (born c. 1465, Virieu-le-Grand, Burgundy—died Aug. 23, 1519,
Geneva), political martyr and leader of the Genevese anti-Savoyard faction (Eidguenots)
that struggled against the powerful duke of Savoy, Charles III, to maintain the
independence of Geneva.
Though no more than a minor public official, Berthelier took an active part in Geneva’s
political controversies. In 1508 he championed the rights of military corporations against
the city council, and in 1509 his protests led to the dismissal of the incumbent vidomne, the
episcopal official charged with civil and criminal jurisdiction. He opposed the installation
of a Savoyard puppet, John, as bishop and temporal lord of Geneva (1513) and in 1515
formed a league of patriots, the Enfants de Genève, to resist the Bishop’s encroachments on
citizen’s rights. Further opposition to the Bishop and his Savoyard connection led to
Berthelier’s arraignment on a charge of lèse-majesté (March 16, 1518); and, although
acquitted by the citizens’ committees (syndics), he was nonetheless summarily arrested and
executed. His struggles against Savoyard influence in Geneva were continued and
ultimately brought to a successful conclusion under the leadership of his friend Bezanson
Hugues.

Prince Phetsarath Ratanavongsa
Prince Phetsarath Ratanavongsa, (born January 19, 1890, Luang Prabang, Laos—died
1959, Vientiane), Lao nationalist and political leader, who is regarded as the founder of Lao
independence.
Phetsarath was the eldest son of Viceroy Boun Khong of the kingdom of Luang Prabang
and the elder brother to Souvanna Phouma and Souphanouvong. He studied in Saigon and
in France, and on his return to Laos in 1913 he joined the civil service of Luang Prabang
under the French protectorate. By 1919 he had become head of the indigenous branch of
the civil service, and for the next two decades he worked to unify Laos by creating a
bureaucracy that would transcend the principalities and provinces into which the country
had been divided by the French.
In 1941 the French ceded additional provinces (including Vientiane) to the Luang Prabang
kingdom and granted executive powers to a Lao cabinet in which Viceroy Phetsarath
served as premier. The Japanese soon occupied the country. When the Japanese surrendered
at the end of World War II, Phetsarath sought to prevent the return of the French and
proclaimed the unification of Laos as a single, independent kingdom. When King
Sisavangvong dismissed him from office, he joined the opposition Lao Issara (Free Laos)
government in Vientiane, and, when the French reoccupied Laos in 1946, he fled to
Thailand. Phetsarath took the lead in forming the Free Laos government-in-exile and
became its head in December 1946.
As the French began making concessions to Lao nationalism, Phetsarath’s brothers
withdrew their support from him and his government-in-exile. Souphanouvong joined with
the Viet Minh to form the communist Pathet Lao and continue armed opposition, and
Souvanna Phouma decided to cooperate with the French and participate in French-
sponsored Lao governments. Phetsarath refused to return to Laos unless assured that efforts
would be made to end the civil war that had developed between rightist and leftist factions,
but his hopes for such a reconciliation were dashed soon after his return to Laos in 1956.
Phetsarath’s autobiography, Iron Man of Laos, was published in 1978.

Rajendra Prasad
Rajendra Prasad, (born December 3, 1884, Zeradei,
India—died February 28, 1963, Patna), Indian
politician, lawyer, and journalist who was the first
president of the Republic of India (1950–62). He also
was a comrade of Mahatma Gandhi early in the
noncooperation movement for independence and was
president of the Indian National Congress (1934,
1939, and 1947).
Raised in a landowning family of modest means, Prasad was a graduate of the Calcutta
Law College. He practiced at the Calcutta High Court and in 1916 transferred to the Patna
High Court and founded the Bihar Law Weekly. In 1917 he was recruited by Gandhi to help
in a campaign to improve conditions for peasants exploited by British indigo planters in
Bihar. He gave up his law practice in 1920 to join the noncooperation movement.
Becoming an active journalist in the nationalist interest, he wrote for Searchlight in
English, founded and edited the Hindi weekly Desh (“Country”), and started his lifelong
campaign to establish Hindi as the national language. Imprisoned several times by the
British for noncooperation activities, he served nearly three years (August 1942–June
1945) in jail with the Congress Party’s Working Committee.
In September 1946 Prasad was sworn in as minister for food and agriculture in the interim
government preceding full independence. From 1946 to 1949 he presided over the Indian
Constituent Assembly and helped to shape the constitution. He was unanimously elected
president in 1950 and, after the first general election (1952), was chosen by an
overwhelming majority of the new electoral college; in 1957 he was elected to a third term.
Prasad retired from public life in 1962 because of his deteriorating health. That same year
he was honoured with the Bharat Ratna, India’s highest civilian award. His autobiography,
Atmakatha, was published in 1946. He is also the author of India Divided (1946), Mahatma
Gandhi and Bihar, Some Reminiscences (1949), and other books.

Ram Manohar Lohia
Ram Manohar Lohia, (born March 23, 1910, Akbarpur, India—died October 12, 1967,
New Delhi), Indian politician and activist who was a prominent figure in socialist politics
and in the movement toward Indian independence. Much of his career was devoted to
combating injustice through the development of a distinctly Indian version of socialism.
Lohia was born to a family of merchants. Following the death of his mother when he was
two, he was raised primarily by his grandparents, although his father’s commitment to
Indian nationalism influenced him during his childhood. Lohia attended Banaras Hindu
University before earning a bachelor’s degree (1929) from the University of Calcutta and a
doctorate (1932) from the University of Berlin, where he studied economics and politics.
In 1934 Lohia became actively involved in the Congress Socialist Party (CSP), founded
that year as a left-wing group within the Indian National Congress; he served on the CSP
executive committee and edited its weekly journal. A vehement opponent of Indian
participation on the side of Great Britain in World War II, he was arrested for anti-British
remarks in 1939 and again in 1940; the latter incident resulted in an 18-month
imprisonment. With the emergence in 1942 of the Quit India movement—a campaign
initiated by Mohandas K. Gandhi to urge the withdrawal of British authorities from India—
Lohia and other CSP leaders (such as Jaya Prakash Narayan) mobilized support from the
underground. For such resistance activities, he was jailed again in 1944–46.
During and after India’s transition to independence in 1947, Lohia continued to play an
active role in its politics. At loggerheads with Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru on several
issues, however, Lohia and other CSP members left the Congress in 1948. He became a
member of the Praja Socialist Party upon its formation in 1952 and served as general
secretary for a brief period, but internecine conflicts led to his resignation in 1955. Later
that year Lohia established a new Socialist Party, for which he became chairman as well as
the editor of its journal, Mankind. A spellbinding orator and a passionate and perceptive
writer, he advocated for various sociopolitical reforms in his capacity as party leader,
including the abolition of the caste system, the adoption of Hindi as India’s national
language, and stronger protection of civil liberties. In 1963 Lohia was elected to the Lok
Sabha (the lower house of parliament), where he was noted for his sharp criticism of
government policies. Although his parliamentary influence was ultimately limited, his
progressive views, which he expressed in numerous publications, proved inspirational to
many Indians.

Ram Singh
Ram Singh, (born 1816, Bhaini, Punjab, India—died 1885, Mergui, Burma [Myanmar]),
Sikh philosopher and reformer and the first Indian to use noncooperation and boycott of
British merchandise and services as a political weapon.
Ram Singh was born into a respected small-farming family. As a young man, he became a
disciple of Balak Singh, the founder of the austere Namdhari movement, from whom he
learned of the great Sikh Gurus and heroes and of the Khalsa (Sikh military brotherhood).
Before his death, Balak Singh appointed him leader of the Namdharis.
At the age of 20 Ram Singh entered the army of the maharaja Ranjit Singh, the mainstay of
the Sikhs. Three years later, on the death of Ranjit Singh, his army and domain fell apart.
Worried about British power and Sikh weakness, Ram Singh determined to help Sikhs
regain their self-respect. He introduced new practices among the Namdharis, who came to
be called Kukas (from Punjabi kuk, “scream” or “cry”) because of the shrieks they emitted
after the frenzied chanting of hymns. His sect was more puritanical and fundamental than
other Sikh sects were. Namdharis wore handwoven white robes, bound their turbans in a
distinctive way, carried wooden staves and rosaries of wool, and used special greetings and
passwords. Their temples, known as gurdwaras, were Spartan in their simplicity.
Ram Singh instilled a sense of worth and dignity into his disciples (many of humble origin)
by telling them that they were the elite of God and that other sects were mleccha
(“unclean”). His private army even had its own couriers, in order to boycott the British
postal service and to prevent messages from falling into enemy hands.
In 1863 Ram Singh attempted a grand gesture: his followers were to meet him at Amritsar
(the Sikh holy city), where he would proclaim himself the reincarnation of Gobind Singh,
the 10th and traditionally the last of the Sikh gurus, and declare that he had come to form a
new Kuka Khalsa. The police intervened, however, and Ram Singh was restricted to his
native village for an indefinite period. As the years passed and his prophecy of breaking
British rule remained unfulfilled, internal trouble broke out. Realizing that they were no
match for British power, the Kukas began to attack the Muslim community.
Following a particularly bloody incident, armed bands of Sikhs attacked Maler Kotla, a
Muslim community, and a large number of the attackers were captured by the British. The
British, sensing that this was no mere bandit raid but the start of a revolt in the Punjab,

dealt with the Kukas in a barbarous way: the prisoners were bound over the mouths of
cannons and blown to bits.
Thereafter Ram Singh even appealed to Russia for aid in driving the British out of India,
but Russia, not wishing to risk war with Great Britain, refused. Ram Singh spent the
remainder of his days in prison and exile. After his release from prison, he was exiled to
Rangoon, where he lived for almost 14 years as a state prisoner. Namdharis believe that
Ram Singh is still alive and will return one day to lead their community.

Ram Singh was born into a respected small-farming family. As a young man, he became a disciple of Balak Singh, the founder of the austere Namdhari movement, from whom he learned of the great Sikh Gurus and heroes and of the Khalsa (Sikh military brotherhood). Before his death, Balak Singh appointed him leader of the Namdharis. At the age of 20 Ram Singh entered the army of the maharaja Ranjit Singh, the mainstay of the Sikhs. Three years later, on the death of Ranjit Singh, his army and domain fell apart. Worried about British power and Sikh weakness, Ram Singh determined to help Sikhs regain their self-respect. He introduced new practices among the Namdharis, who came to be called Kukas (from Punjabi kuk, “scream” or “cry”) because of the shrieks they emitted after the frenzied chanting of hymns. His sect was more puritanical and fundamental than other Sikh sects were. Namdharis wore handwoven white robes, bound their turbans in a distinctive way, carried wooden staves and rosaries of wool, and used special greetings and passwords. Their temples, known as gurdwaras, were Spartan in their simplicity. Ram Singh instilled a sense of worth and dignity into his disciples (many of humble origin) by telling them that they were the elite of God and that other sects were mleccha (“unclean”). His private army even had its own couriers, in order to boycott the British postal service and to prevent messages from falling into enemy hands. In 1863 Ram Singh attempted a grand gesture: his followers were to meet him at Amritsar (the Sikh holy city), where he would proclaim himself the reincarnation of Gobind Singh, the 10th and traditionally the last of the Sikh gurus, and declare that he had come to form a new Kuka Khalsa. The police intervened, however, and Ram Singh was restricted to his native village for an indefinite period. As the years passed and his prophecy of breaking British rule remained unfulfilled, internal trouble broke out. Realizing that they were no match for British power, the Kukas began to attack the Muslim community. Following a particularly bloody incident, armed bands of Sikhs attacked Maler Kotla, a Muslim community, and a large number of the attackers were captured by the British. The British, sensing that this was no mere bandit raid but the start of a revolt in the Punjab,  Ram Singh   dealt with the Kukas in a barbarous way: the prisoners were bound over the mouths of cannons and blown to bits. Thereafter Ram Singh even appealed to Russia for aid in driving the British out of India, but Russia, not wishing to risk war with Great Britain, refused. Ram Singh spent the remainder of his days in prison and exile. After his release from prison, he was exiled to Rangoon, where he lived for almost 14 years as a state prisoner. Namdharis believe that Ram Singh is still alive and will return one day to lead their community. This article was most recently revised and updated by Brian Duignan.",

Lévesque, René
René Lévesque
René Lévesque, (born August 24, 1922,
Campbellton, New Brunswick, Canada—died
November 1, 1987, Montreal, Quebec), premier of the
French-speaking Canadian province of Quebec
(1976–85) and a leading advocate of sovereignty for
that province.
Lévesque went to school in Gaspésie and afterward to Laval University, Quebec. Already a
part-time journalist while still a student, he broke off his law studies to serve in Europe
(1944–45) as a reporter and correspondent attached to the U.S. forces. Back in Quebec
after the war, he joined the international service of the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation
in 1946, became a war correspondent in Korea in 1952, and from 1956 to 1959 was
commentator on a popular TV news program.
Lévesque entered politics in 1960 and was elected to the Quebec National Assembly as a
Liberal member for Gouin, joining Jean Lesage’s government as minister of public works
and hydraulic resources (1960–61). He then held the newly created portfolio of natural
resources (1961–65), and in 1966, during the last months of the Lesage government, he
was minister of family and social welfare. Meanwhile he had been reelected in the
constituency of Laurier in the 1962 and 1966 legislative elections.
In October 1967 Lévesque, with others, founded the Mouvement Souveraineté-Association,
which the following year combined with other separatist groups to form the left-wing Parti
Québécois, with Lévesque as its first president. He was unsuccessful in the elections of
1970 and 1973 and returned in part to journalism, writing daily political articles in the
Journal de Montréal and the Journal de Québec, until 1976, when his party won control of
the provincial National Assembly and he became the premier of Quebec. He was reelected
premier in April 1981.
The goal of Lévesque and his Parti Québécois government was the independence option
termed “sovereignty-association.” The concept envisaged Quebec enacting its own laws,
collecting taxes from its people, and establishing relations with foreign countries.
Simultaneously, it would form an economic union with the rest of Canada based on a
common currency.

This plan was rejected by 59.6 percent of the Quebec electorate in a popular-referendum
vote on May 20, 1980, amid one of the highest voter turnouts in Quebec’s history. Despite
this serious setback to his plan for “sovereignty-association,” Lévesque (as his reelection
demonstrates) retained his personal popularity.
In June 1985, largely because of failing health, Lévesque resigned from the leadership of
the Parti Québécois and later gave up the premiership of Quebec, at a time when the power
of his party was waning. For many Québécois he remains something of a modern folk hero
for his spirited defense of their nationalism.

Emmet, Robert
Robert Emmet
Robert Emmet, (born 1778, Dublin—died Sept. 20,
1803, Dublin), Irish nationalist leader who inspired
the abortive rising of 1803, remembered as a romantic
hero of Irish lost causes.
Like his elder brother Thomas, Robert Emmet
became involved with the United Irishmen and from
1800 to 1802 was on the Continent with their exiled leaders, who, with French support,
were planning an insurrection against English rule. Back in Ireland in October 1802, he hid
at his father’s house near Milltown while pikes and other crude weapons were collected
and stored in Dublin. In 1803 Emmet’s hand was forced by an explosion at one of his secret
arms depots, and he called for a rising on July 23. The ill-planned insurrection ended in
utter confusion. The Wicklow contingent never arrived; the Kildare men retired thinking
the rising had been postponed; while the men at Broadstairs waited vainly for the signal.
Wearing a green and white uniform, Emmet marched with a small band against Dublin
Castle. On the way they encountered the lord chief justice, Lord Kilwarden, and his
nephew, pulled them from their carriage, and murdered them. Realizing the cause was lost,
Emmet escaped and hid in the Wicklow Mountains. He then moved to Harold’s Cross to be
near his fiancée, Sarah Curran, with whom he hoped to escape to America. He was
captured on August 25, tried for treason, and hanged on Sept. 20, 1803.
Thomas Moore’s songs, “She is far from the land where her young hero sleeps” and “Oh
breathe not the name” were inspired by Emmet’s love affair with Curran.

Robert Erskine Childers
Robert Erskine Childers, (born June 25, 1870,
London, Eng.—died Nov. 24, 1922, Beggar’s Bush,
County Dublin, Ire.), writer and Irish nationalist,
executed for his actions in support of the republican
cause in the civil war that followed the establishment
of the Irish Free State.
Childers, a first cousin of the English politician Hugh Childers, was a clerk in the House of
Commons from 1895 to 1910, except for a period he spent serving in the South African
War. He resigned this position to devote himself to the cause of Irish Home Rule. In July
1914, at Howth, north of Dublin, he landed from his own yacht a cargo of rifles that he had
purchased in Germany for the revolutionary Irish Volunteers.
Despite his position on British rule in Ireland, Childers served the British in World War I as
an intelligence and aerial reconnaissance officer. But by the end of the war, he supported a
wholly independent Irish republic. In 1921 he was elected to Dáil Éireann (Irish Assembly)
as a Sinn Féin deputy from County Wicklow and became the Dáil’s minister of
propaganda. Later that year he served as secretary to the Irish delegation to the Anglo-Irish
Treaty conference. Opposing the concessions that Irish leaders Arthur Griffith and Michael
Collins made to the British in signing the treaty (Dec. 6, 1921), Childers used his
propaganda and publicity skills to support the Irish Republican Army (IRA) in the ensuing
civil war. After being captured by Free State forces, Childers was court-martialed in Dublin
on a charge of unauthorized possession of a revolver and was shot by a firing squad.
Childers was the author of The Riddle of the Sands (1903), a popular spy story involving an
imaginary German raid on England.

Robert the Bruce
Robert the Bruce
Robert the Bruce, original name Robert VIII de Bruce,
also called Robert I, (born July 11, 1274—died June 7,
1329, Cardross, Dumbartonshire, Scotland), king of
Scotland (1306–29), who freed Scotland from English
rule, winning the decisive Battle of Bannockburn (1314)
and ultimately confirming Scottish independence in the
Treaty of Northampton (1328).
Background and early life
The Anglo-Norman family of Bruce, which had come to Scotland in the early 12th century,
was related by marriage to the Scottish royal family, and hence the sixth Robert de Bruce
(died 1295), grandfather of the future king, claimed the throne when it was left vacant in
1290. The English king Edward I claimed feudal superiority over the Scots and awarded
the crown to John de Balliol instead.
The eighth Robert de Bruce was born in 1274. His father, the seventh Robert de Bruce
(died 1304), resigned the title of earl of Carrick in his favour in 1292, but little else is
known of his career until 1306. In the confused period of rebellions against English rule
from 1295 to 1304 he appears at one time among the leading supporters of the rebel
William Wallace, but later apparently regained Edward I’s confidence. There is nothing at
this period to suggest that he was soon to become the Scottish leader in a war of
independence against Edward’s attempt to govern Scotland directly.
The decisive event was the murder of John (“the Red”) Comyn in the Franciscan church at
Dumfries on February 10, 1306, either by Bruce or his followers. Comyn, a nephew of
John de Balliol, was a possible rival for the crown, and Bruce’s actions suggest that he had
already decided to seize the throne. He hastened to Scone and was crowned on March 25.
King of Scots
The new king’s position was very difficult. Edward I, whose garrisons held many of the
important castles in Scotland, regarded him as a traitor and made every effort to crush a
movement that he treated as a rebellion. King Robert was twice defeated in 1306, at
Methven, near Perth, on June 19, and at Dalry, near Tyndrum, Perthshire, on August 11. His
wife and many of his supporters were captured, and three of his brothers executed. Robert

himself became a fugitive, hiding on the remote island of Rathlin off the north Irish coast.
It was during this period, with his fortunes at low ebb, that he is supposed to have derived
hope and patience from watching a spider perseveringly weaving its web.
In February 1307 he returned to Ayrshire. His main
supporter at first was his only surviving brother,
Edward, but in the next few years he attracted a
number of others. Robert himself defeated John
Comyn, earl of Buchan (a cousin of the slain John
“the Red”), and in 1313 captured Perth, which had
been in the hands of an English garrison. Much of the
fighting, however, was done by Robert’s supporters,
notably James Douglas and Thomas Randolph, later earl of Moray, who progressively
conquered Galloway, Douglasdale, the forest of Selkirk and most of the eastern borders,
and finally, in 1314, Edinburgh. During these years the king was helped by the support of
some of the leading Scottish churchmen and also by the death of Edward I in 1307 and the
ineptness of his successor, Edward II. The test came in 1314 when a large English army
attempted to relieve the garrison of Stirling. Its defeat at Bannockburn on June 24 marked
the triumph of Robert I.
Consolidation of power
Almost the whole of the rest of his reign had passed before he forced the English
government to recognize his position. Berwick was captured in 1318, and there were
repeated raids into the north of England, which inflicted great damage. Eventually, after the
deposition of Edward II (1327), Edward III’s regency government decided to make peace
by the Treaty of Northampton (1328) on terms that included the recognition of Robert I’s
title as king of Scots and the abandonment of all English claims to overlordship.
Robert’s main energies in the years after 1314, however, were devoted to settling the affairs
of his kingdom. Until the birth of the future king David II in 1324 he had no male heir, and
two statutes, in 1315 and 1318, were concerned with the succession. In addition, a
parliament in 1314 decreed that all who remained in the allegiance of the English should
forfeit their lands; this decree provided the means to reward supporters, and there are many
charters regranting the lands so forfeited. Sometimes these grants proved dangerous, for the
king’s chief supporters became enormously powerful. James Douglas, knighted at
Bannockburn, acquired important lands in the counties of Selkirk and Roxburgh that
became the nucleus of the later power of the Douglas family on the borders. Robert I also

had to restart the processes of royal government, for administration had been more or less
in abeyance since 1296. By the end of the reign the system of exchequer audits was again
functioning, and to this period belongs the earliest surviving roll of the register of the great
seal.
In the last years of his life, Robert I suffered from ill health and spent most of this time at
Cardross, Dumbartonshire, where he died, possibly of leprosy. His body was buried in
Dunfermline Abbey, but the heart was removed on his instructions and taken by Sir James
Douglas on crusade in Spain. Douglas was killed, but it appears that the heart was
recovered and brought back for burial, as the king had intended, at Melrose Abbey. In 1921
a cone-shaped casket containing a heart was uncovered during excavations at the abbey,
reburied at that time, and reexcavated in 1996. (Heart burial was relatively common among
royalty and the aristocracy, however, and there is no specific evidence that this casket is the
king’s.) In later times Robert I came to be revered as one of the heroes of Scottish national
sentiment and legend.

Roman Dmowski
Roman Dmowski, (born Aug. 9, 1864, Kamionek [now in Warsaw, Pol.]—died Jan. 2,
1939, Drozdowo, Pol.), Polish statesman, a leader of Poland’s struggle for national
liberation, and the foremost supporter of cooperation with Russia as a means toward
achieving that goal.
As a student in Warsaw, Dmowski involved himself in the movement for Polish liberation
and in 1895 helped found the influential Przegląd Wszechpolski (“All-Polish Review”) at
Lwów (now Lviv, Ukraine). A leader of the National Democratic Party from its foundation
(1897), he opposed revolutionary methods of establishing an independent Poland and
favoured an autonomist solution to national aspirations within the Russian Empire. During
the Russo-Japanese War (1904–05) he actively combated the plans of Polish
revolutionaries—especially Józef Piłsudski, to secure an understanding with Japan as a
prelude to national insurrection. He later distinguished himself in the second and third
Russian Dumas (legislative assemblies) as the chief spokesman for Polish collaboration
with Russia. By 1912, however, his policy had been largely discredited, and in October of
that year he failed to be elected to the fourth Duma.
During the early months of World War I, Dmowski helped form a “National Committee”
that sought to achieve Polish national aims through cooperation with Russia and its
Western allies. From the summer of 1915, however, he looked solely to the Western powers
for deliverance and discarded his autonomist program for one demanding full national
sovereignty for Poland. In August 1917 he formed a National Committee at Lausanne,
Switz., which later was recognized by the Allies as the official representative of Polish
interests.
After the war Dmowski represented the new Polish national government at the Paris Peace
Conference, and in June 1919 he signed the Treaty of Versailles. He subsequently sat in the
constituent Sejm (Polish national assembly) until 1922 and briefly served as foreign
minister during 1923, but thereafter he largely retired from active politics. His book
Niemcy, Rosya i kwestya polska (1908; “Germany, Russia, and the Polish Question”) is an
exposition of his prewar views.

Saad Zaghloul
Saad Zaghloul
Saad Zaghloul, also spelled, in full, Saʿd Zaghlūl
Pasha ibn Ibrāhīm, (born July 1857, Ibyānah, Egypt
—died August 23, 1927, Cairo), Egyptian statesman
and patriot, leader of the Wafd party and of the
nationalist movement of 1918–19, which led Britain
to give Egypt nominal independence in 1922. He was
briefly prime minister in 1924.
Zaghloul was from a well-to-do peasant family in Ibyānah in the Nile River delta. He was
educated at the Muslim Al-Azhar University in Cairo and at the Egyptian School of Law,
then practiced as an advocate and also dabbled in journalism. Becoming a judge in the
Court of Appeal in 1892, he married, in 1895, a daughter of Muṣṭafā Pasha Fahmī, the
prime minister of Egypt. In 1906 he was made head of the newly created Ministry of
Education and, soon after, took a leading part in the formation of the Ḥizb al-Ummah
(“People’s Party”), which, at a time when Egyptian nationalism was beginning to assert
itself against the British occupation, was referred to appreciatively by Evelyn Baring, 1st
earl of Cromer, the British consul general and virtual ruler of the country, as advocating a
policy of “cooperation with Europeans in the introduction of Western civilization into the
country.”
He remained as minister of education until 1910, when he became minister of justice, a
post from which he resigned in 1912 after a disagreement with the khedive ʿAbbās II
(Ḥilmī). During his six years as a minister, he had served in a series of governments that
had collaborated with the British occupiers and the members of which were thus regarded
almost as traitors by the extreme nationalists. In 1912, however, Zaghloul’s attitude
changed. Elected to the Legislative Assembly, a unicameral parliament with limited
powers, in 1913, he became its vice president and in the course of one year rehabilitated
himself in the eyes of the nationalists by his criticisms of the government.
With the outbreak of World War I in 1914, Egypt became a British protectorate. The
khedive was deposed, martial law declared, and the Legislative Assembly dissolved by the
British. For the next four years overt political activity in Egypt was at a standstill. Ordinary
Egyptians suffered from the effects of inflation, requisitioning, and conscription, and the
intelligentsia and the professional classes were frustrated by restrictions on personal
freedom and by the evident British intention to convert a temporary protectorate into a

permanent colony. By the time the armistice was signed in November 1918, the country
was seething with discontent.
Zaghloul and several former members of the defunct Legislative Assembly, free of the taint
of collaboration, had spent the war years forming activist groups throughout Egypt for the
ultimate purpose of political agitation and action. On November 13, 1918, two days after
the armistice, a delegation (wafd) of three prominent former members of the Legislative
Assembly, led by Zaghloul, called on Sir Reginald Wingate, the high commissioner (as the
British representative in Egypt was now called). They informed him that they regarded
themselves and not the government as the true representatives of the Egyptian people and
demanded that the protectorate be abolished and replaced by a treaty of alliance. They also
demanded that they be allowed to proceed to London to negotiate such a treaty directly
with the British government.
When these demands were refused, widespread disorder broke out, organized through the
clandestine bodies set up by Zaghloul and his associates. In March 1919 Zaghloul and three
of his associates were arrested and deported to Malta, an act that increased the disorder.
The British government dismissed Wingate and replaced him with General Edmund
Allenby, the wartime conqueror of Palestine. Allenby, faced with the resignation of the
government and the prospect of a continuing military campaign to put down a countrywide
rebellion, released Zaghloul and his associates in an attempt to appease Egyptian opinion.
Zaghloul immediately proceeded to Paris, where the Peace Conference was in session, to
present Egypt’s case to the Allies. He met with very little success there, but in Egypt he had
become a national hero and the master of the situation.
Zaghloul’s release put a temporary end to public disorder in Egypt, and in the fall of 1919,
on Allenby’s recommendation, a mission headed by Lord Milner, the British colonial
secretary, proceeded to Egypt to make recommendations for the future relationship between
the two countries. Zaghloul, determined that nobody but himself should negotiate with the
British, saw to it that the mission was boycotted by all shades of Egyptian opinion. In the
summer of 1920 he himself had a series of meetings with Milner in London, at which
Milner agreed—unofficially—to the essence of what Zaghloul himself had demanded of
Wingate in November 1918: the substitution of a treaty of alliance for the protectorate. But
Zaghloul had come to fear that any agreement he made with the British would undermine
his position in Egypt, which was based on opposition to the British, so he refused to
endorse any agreement and returned to Egypt, where he was greeted with wild enthusiasm.
The Milner Report, recommending the end of the protectorate and the negotiation of a

treaty, was published in February 1921. A government formed by ʿAdlī Pasha Yakan, one
of Zaghloul’s rivals, spent most of the year trying to negotiate such a treaty but was
inhibited by Zaghloul’s virtual veto power. When ʿAdlī consequently resigned, Zaghloul
brought his supporters onto the streets to prevent the formation of any alternative
government. Allenby then had Zaghloul arrested and deported to the Seychelles and
prevailed on a reluctant British government to promulgate a unilateral declaration that
incorporated the Milner recommendations and conferred a limited measure of
independence on Egypt (February 1922).
By this time a number of Egyptian politicians, including some of Zaghloul’s previous
supporters, alarmed at the social implications of the agitation that Zaghloul had released,
were prepared to cooperate with the British under the new dispensation. A new party, the
Liberal Constitutionalists, was formed and a constitution promulgated. But the forces
unleashed by Zaghloul could not so easily be suppressed, either by his opponents or even
by Zaghloul himself. Zaghloul was released to take part in the first elections under the new
constitution. His party, the Wafd, swept the board, and in January 1924 he became prime
minister. In office he showed himself quite unable to control the violent agitation he had set
in motion. In November 1924, after a year in which numerous British officials and
Egyptian “collaborationists” had been murdered by extremists, the British commander in
chief of the Egyptian army was assassinated. After the receipt of what amounted to an
ultimatum from Allenby, Zaghloul resigned. The shock resulting from the violent British
reaction rallied the moderates and discouraged the extremists—though, in a general
election held in May 1926, the Wafd still held the allegiance of the country. But Zaghloul,
an old man of nearly 70, was no longer eager for office. Under pressure from Lord Lloyd,
the new British high commissioner, he agreed to the formation of a coalition government
and contented himself with the presidency of the Chamber. In this capacity he succeeded,
by and large, in controlling the actions of his more extreme followers until his death.
Zaghloul was not a constructive statesman. Rather, he was the catalyst whose injection into
Egyptian political life set in motion that long course of popular protest against foreign
occupation, indigenous despotism, and social feudalism whose end product was the
revolution of 1952. His influence resided both in his eloquence and in the fact that—unlike
most of his generation in positions of power, which were mainly occupied by members of
the old, Turkish-descended aristocracy—he was an Egyptian from a peasant background, a
man of the people who became the incarnation of their virtues and their limitations.

Sam Nujoma
Sam Nujoma, byname of Samuel Shafiihuma Nujoma, (born May 12, 1929, Owambo,
South West Africa [now Namibia]), first president of independent Namibia (1990–2005).
Nujoma was born to a peasant family in the remote Ongandjera region of Owambo
(Ovamboland) and spent his early years tending the family’s few cattle and goats. His
primary education began at night school, and he left school at age 16 to become a railway
dining-car steward. After a fellow worker was sent home without compensation following a
serious injury, Nujoma tried to form a trade union for railway men but was discharged. He
subsequently worked as a clerk and a store assistant.
In the late 1950s he helped found the Ovamboland People’s Organization, the forerunner of
the South West Africa People’s Organization (SWAPO). He went into exile in 1960 and
was named president of SWAPO after it was founded on April 19 of that year. After several
years of fruitlessly petitioning the United Nations to compel South Africa to release control
of South West Africa, SWAPO embarked on an armed struggle in 1966. Although its
guerrilla force, the People’s Liberation Army of Namibia (PLAN), failed to liberate any
territory, it succeeded in focusing international attention on Namibia. In 1973 the UN
General Assembly recognized SWAPO as the sole legitimate representative of the
Namibian people, and in 1978 the Security Council adopted Resolution 435, which set out
terms for eventual Namibian independence and which was finally accepted by South Africa
in 1988. In September 1989, after nearly 30 years in exile, Nujoma returned to Namibia to
lead SWAPO to victory in the UN-supervised November elections. On the day of
Namibia’s independence, March 21, 1990, Nujoma was sworn in as president.
Although often accused of being a Marxist, Nujoma professed himself drawn more to the
pragmatism of Scandinavian democratic socialism. In 1994 he was reelected president, and
in 1998 the SWAPO-controlled parliament agreed to amend the constitution, allowing
Nujoma to run for a third term. The move drew international and domestic criticism, but
Nujoma easily won reelection in 1999. He later announced that he would not run for a
fourth term, and in 2005 he stepped down from office, allowing for a peaceful transfer of
power to his democratically elected successor, Hifikepunye Pohamba (SWAPO). Nujoma
stepped down from his position as president of SWAPO in 2007.

Samuel Adams
Samuel Adams
Samuel Adams, (born September 27 [September 16,
Old Style], 1722, Boston, Massachusetts [U.S.]—died
October 2, 1803, Boston), politician of the American
Revolution, leader of the Massachusetts “radicals,”
who was a delegate to the Continental Congress
(1774–81) and a signer of the Declaration of
Independence. He was later lieutenant governor
(1789–93) and governor (1794–97) of Massachusetts.
Early career
A second cousin of John Adams, second president of the United States, Samuel Adams was
graduated from Harvard College in 1740 and briefly studied law; he failed in several
business ventures. As a tax collector in Boston, he neglected to collect the public levies and
to keep proper accounts, thus exposing himself to suit.
Although unsuccessful in conducting personal or public business, Adams took an active
and influential part in local politics. By the time the English Parliament passed the Sugar
Act (1764) taxing molasses for revenue, Adams was a powerful figure in the opposition to
British authority in the colonies. He denounced the act, being one of the first of the
colonials to cry out against taxation without representation. He played an important part in
instigating the Stamp Act riots in Boston that were directed against the new requirement to
pay taxes on all legal and commercial documents, newspapers, and college diplomas.
Commitment to American independence
His influence was soon second only to James Otis, the
lawyer and politician who gained prominence by his
resistance to the revenue acts. Elected to the lower
house of the Massachusetts general court from
Boston, Adams served in that body until 1774, after
1766 as its clerk. In 1769 Adams assumed the
leadership of the Massachusetts radicals. There is
some reason to believe that he had committed himself to American independence a year
earlier. John Adams may have erred in ascribing this extreme stand to his cousin at so early
a time, but certainly Samuel Adams was one of the first American leaders to deny

Boston Tea Party broadside
Parliament’s authority over the colonies, and he was also one of the first—certainly by
1774—to establish independence as the proper goal.
John Adams described his cousin as a plain, modest, and virtuous man. But in addition,
Samuel Adams was a propagandist who was not overscrupulous in his attacks upon British
officials and policies, and a passionate politician as well. In innumerable newspaper letters
and essays over various signatures, he described British measures and the behaviour of
royal governors, judges, and customs men in the darkest colours. He was a master of
organization, arranging for the election of men who agreed with him, procuring committees
that would act as he wished, and securing the passage of resolutions that he desired.
During the crisis over the Townshend duties (1767–70), the import taxes on previously
duty-free products proposed by Cabinet Minister Charles Townshend, Adams was unable to
persuade the Massachusetts colonists to take extreme steps, partly because of the
moderating influence of Otis. British troops sent to Boston in 1768, however, offered a fine
target for this propaganda, and Adams saw to it that they were portrayed in the colonial
newspapers as brutal soldiery oppressing citizens and assailing their wives and daughters.
He was one of the leaders in the town meeting that demanded and secured the removal of
the troops from Boston after some British soldiers fired into a mob and killed five
Americans. When news came that the Townshend duties, except for that on tea, had been
repealed, his following dwindled. Nevertheless, during the years 1770–73, when other
colonial leaders were inactive, Adams revived old issues and found new ones; he was
responsible for the foundation (1772) of the committee of correspondence of Boston that
kept in contact with similar bodies in whose establishment he also had a hand in other
towns. These committees later became effective instruments in the fight against the British.
The passage by Parliament of the Tea Act of 1773,
which granted the East India Company a monopoly
on tea sales in the colonies, gave Adams ample
opportunity to exercise his remarkable talents.
Although he did not participate in the Boston Tea
Party, he was undoubtedly one of its planners. He was
again a leading figure in the opposition of
Massachusetts to the execution of the Intolerable (Coercive) Acts passed by the British
Parliament in retaliation for the dumping of tea in Boston Harbor, and, as a member of the
First Continental Congress, which spoke for the 13 colonies, he insisted that the delegates
take a vigorous stand against Britain. A member of the provincial congress of

Massachusetts in 1774–75, he participated in making preparations for warfare should
Britain resort to arms. When the British troops marched out of Boston to Concord, Adams
and the president of the Continental Congress, John Hancock, were staying in a farmhouse
near the line of march, and it has been said that the arrest of the two men was one of the
purposes of the expedition. But the troops made no effort to find them, and British orders
called only for destruction of military supplies gathered at Concord. When Gen. Thomas
Gage issued an offer of pardon to the rebels some weeks later, however, he excepted
Adams and Hancock.
Membership in Continental Congress
As a member of the Continental Congress, in which he served until 1781, Adams was less
conspicuous than he was in town meetings and the Massachusetts legislature, for the
congress contained a number of men as able as he. He and John Adams were among the
first to call for a final separation from Britain, both signed the Declaration of
Independence, and both exerted considerable influence in the congress.
Adams was a member of the convention that framed the Massachusetts constitution of
1780 and also sat in the convention of his state that ratified the Federal Constitution. He
was at first an anti-Federalist who opposed the ratification of the Constitution for fear that
it would vest too much power in the federal government, but he finally abandoned his
opposition when the Federalists promised to support a number of future amendments,
including a bill of rights. He was defeated in the first congressional election. Returning to
political power as a follower of Hancock, he was lieutenant governor of Massachusetts
from 1789 to 1793 and governor from 1794 to 1797. When national parties developed, he
affiliated himself with the Democratic Republicans, the followers of Thomas Jefferson.
After being defeated as a presidential elector favouring Jefferson in 1796, he retired to
private life.

He was later lieutenant governor (1789–93) and governor (1794–97) of Massachusetts. Early career A second cousin of John Adams, second president of the United States, Samuel Adams was graduated from Harvard College in 1740 and briefly studied law; he failed in several business ventures. As a tax collector in Boston, he neglected to collect the public levies and to keep proper accounts, thus exposing himself to suit. Although unsuccessful in conducting personal or public business, Adams took an active and influential part in local politics. By the time the English Parliament passed the Sugar Act (1764) taxing molasses for revenue, Adams was a powerful figure in the opposition to British authority in the colonies. He denounced the act, being one of the first of the colonials to cry out against taxation without representation. He played an important part in instigating the Stamp Act riots in Boston that were directed against the new requirement to pay taxes on all legal and commercial documents, newspapers, and college diplomas. Commitment to American independence His influence was soon second only to James Otis, the lawyer and politician who gained prominence by his resistance to the revenue acts. Elected to the lower house of the Massachusetts general court from Boston, Adams served in that body until 1774, after 1766 as its clerk. In 1769 Adams assumed the leadership of the Massachusetts radicals. There is some reason to believe that he had committed himself to American independence a year earlier. John Adams may have erred in ascribing this extreme stand to his cousin at so early a time, but certainly Samuel Adams was one of the first American leaders to deny  Samuel Adams   Boston Tea Party broadside Parliament’s authority over the colonies, and he was also one of the first—certainly by 1774—to establish independence as the proper goal. John Adams described his cousin as a plain, modest, and virtuous man. But in addition, Samuel Adams was a propagandist who was not overscrupulous in his attacks upon British officials and policies, and a passionate politician as well. In innumerable newspaper letters and essays over various signatures, he described British measures and the behaviour of royal governors, judges, and customs men in the darkest colours. He was a master of organization, arranging for the election of men who agreed with him, procuring committees that would act as he wished, and securing the passage of resolutions that he desired. During the crisis over the Townshend duties (1767–70), the import taxes on previously duty-free products proposed by Cabinet Minister Charles Townshend, Adams was unable to persuade the Massachusetts colonists to take extreme steps, partly because of the moderating influence of Otis. British troops sent to Boston in 1768, however, offered a fine target for this propaganda, and Adams saw to it that they were portrayed in the colonial newspapers as brutal soldiery oppressing citizens and assailing their wives and daughters. He was one of the leaders in the town meeting that demanded and secured the removal of the troops from Boston after some British soldiers fired into a mob and killed five Americans. When news came that the Townshend duties, except for that on tea, had been repealed, his following dwindled. Nevertheless, during the years 1770–73, when other colonial leaders were inactive, Adams revived old issues and found new ones; he was responsible for the foundation (1772) of the committee of correspondence of Boston that kept in contact with similar bodies in whose establishment he also had a hand in other towns. These committees later became effective instruments in the fight against the British. The passage by Parliament of the Tea Act of 1773, which granted the East India Company a monopoly on tea sales in the colonies, gave Adams ample opportunity to exercise his remarkable talents. Although he did not participate in the Boston Tea Party, he was undoubtedly one of its planners. He was again a leading figure in the opposition of Massachusetts to the execution of the Intolerable (Coercive) Acts passed by the British Parliament in retaliation for the dumping of tea in Boston Harbor, and, as a member of the First Continental Congress, which spoke for the 13 colonies, he insisted that the delegates take a vigorous stand against Britain. A member of the provincial congress of  Samuel Adams   Massachusetts in 1774–75, he participated in making preparations for warfare should Britain resort to arms. When the British troops marched out of Boston to Concord, Adams and the president of the Continental Congress, John Hancock, were staying in a farmhouse near the line of march, and it has been said that the arrest of the two men was one of the purposes of the expedition. But the troops made no effort to find them, and British orders called only for destruction of military supplies gathered at Concord. When Gen. Thomas Gage issued an offer of pardon to the rebels some weeks later, however, he excepted Adams and Hancock. Membership in Continental Congress As a member of the Continental Congress, in which he served until 1781, Adams was less conspicuous than he was in town meetings and the Massachusetts legislature, for the congress contained a number of men as able as he. He and John Adams were among the first to call for a final separation from Britain, both signed the Declaration of Independence, and both exerted considerable influence in the congress. Adams was a member of the convention that framed the Massachusetts constitution of 1780 and also sat in the convention of his state that ratified the Federal Constitution. He was at first an anti-Federalist who opposed the ratification of the Constitution for fear that it would vest too much power in the federal government, but he finally abandoned his opposition when the Federalists promised to support a number of future amendments, including a bill of rights. He was defeated in the first congressional election. Returning to political power as a follower of Hancock, he was lieutenant governor of Massachusetts from 1789 to 1793 and governor from 1794 to 1797. When national parties developed, he affiliated himself with the Democratic Republicans, the followers of Thomas Jefferson. After being defeated as a presidential elector favouring Jefferson in 1796, he retired to private life.

Sant Fateh Singh
Sant Fateh Singh, (born October 27, 1911, Punjab, India—died October 30, 1972,
Amritsar, Punjab), Sikh religious leader who became the foremost campaigner for Sikh
rights in postindependence India.
Fateh Singh spent most of his early career in social and educational activities around
Ganganagar, in what is now northern Rajasthan state, western India. In the 1940s he, Tara
Singh, and other Sikh leaders joined the Quit India movement, a confederation of Indians
determined to force Great Britain to give up its governance of India. India gained its
independence in 1947, and by 1955 Fateh Singh and Tara Singh were advocating the
establishment of Punjabi Suba, a Punjabi-speaking autonomous state in India in which Sikh
religious, cultural, and linguistic integrity could be preserved intact.
In the early 1960s Fateh Singh entered into a power struggle with Tara Singh over the
leadership of the Sikh autonomy movement in Punjab state. The conflict between the two
Sikh leaders ended in 1962 in victory for Fateh Singh when he took over the leadership of
the Shiromani Akali Dal (Supreme Akali Party) from Tara Singh. Fateh Singh eventually
became the leader of the entire Sikh community, and in 1966, partly owing to his agitation,
Punjab state was divided along linguistic lines into the largely Punjabi-speaking Punjab
state and Hindi-speaking Haryana state.

Sant Jarnail Singh Bhindranwale
Sant Jarnail Singh Bhindranwale, original name Jarnail Singh, (born 1947, Rodey [or
Rode], India—died June 6, 1984, Amritsar), Sikh religious leader and political
revolutionary whose violent campaign for autonomy for the Sikh state of Punjab and armed
occupation of the Harmandir Sahib (Golden Temple) complex in Amritsar led to a violent
and deadly confrontation with the Indian military in 1984.
Jarnail Singh was born into a Sikh peasant family in a village near Faridkot in what is now
southwestern Punjab state, India. He attended a residential Sikh seminary (taksal) in the
village of Bhindran (near Sangrur), where students were trained to become granthis
(custodians of the gurdwaras [Sikh places of worship]), preachers, and ragis (singers of
Sikh sacred hymns). The chief of the Bhindran taksal, Sant Gurbachan Singh, was widely
revered. After his death in 1969, one of his followers, Sant Kartar Singh, moved to Mehta,
in northwestern Punjab about 25 miles (40 km) east of Amritsar, and established a new
taksal there. Jarnail Singh accompanied him and succeeded him as head of the Mehta
taksal after his death in 1977. At some point he took the name Bhindranwale (for
Bhindran).
Bhindranwale was known for his charisma as well as his knowledge of the scripture and
history of Sikhism. He was asked by Zail Singh of the Indian National Congress (Congress
Party), who later became the president of India, to align with them in their effort to break
the hold of the Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD; Supreme Akali Party) on rank-and-file Sikhs.
Bhindranwale obliged, but in the process he became increasingly aware of the role he
might play in Sikh history. By setting himself as an example, Bhindranwale hoped to
restore the Sikh community to its traditions of bravery and martyrdom. He argued against
the SAD’s policy of negotiating their demands peacefully with the central government in
New Delhi, insisting that political power in the Punjab was a Sikh right, not a gift of the
Delhi regime. Bhindranwale succeeded in convincing a large number of rural Sikhs that the
politics of the SAD were humiliating for them.
In July 1982 he moved to the Harmandir Sahib (Golden Temple) complex in Amritsar. He
gathered a considerable following of like-minded Sikhs and stockpiled weapons. In early
June 1984 Prime Minister Indira Gandhi ordered Indian troops to attack the complex, and,
in the fighting that followed, several of its buildings were heavily damaged. According to
the government authorities, hundreds of people were killed in the action, including

Bhindranwale. Other reports (notably from Sikhs) put the death toll considerably higher,
possibly as many as 3,000. For many Sikhs, he died the death of a martyr.

Mohandas Gandhi and Sarojini
Naidu
Sarojini Naidu
Sarojini Naidu, née Sarojini Chattopadhyay, (born
February 13, 1879, Hyderabad, India—died March 2,
1949, Lucknow), political activist, feminist, poet, and
the first Indian woman to be president of the Indian
National Congress and to be appointed an Indian state
governor. She was sometimes called “the Nightingale
of India.”
Sarojini was the eldest daughter of Aghorenath Chattopadhyay, a Bengali Brahman who
was principal of the Nizam’s College, Hyderabad. She entered the University of Madras at
the age of 12 and studied (1895–98) at King’s College, London, and later at Girton College,
Cambridge.
After some experience in the suffragist campaign in
England, she was drawn to India’s Congress
movement and to Mahatma Gandhi’s Noncooperation
Movement. In 1924 she traveled in eastern Africa and
South Africa in the interest of Indians there and the
following year became the first Indian woman
president of the National Congress—having been
preceded eight years earlier by the English feminist
Annie Besant. She toured North America, lecturing on the Congress movement, in 1928–
29. Back in India her anti-British activity brought her a number of prison sentences (1930,
1932, and 1942–43). She accompanied Gandhi to London for the inconclusive second
session of the Round Table Conference for Indian–British cooperation (1931). Upon the
outbreak of World War II she supported the Congress Party’s policies, first of aloofness,
then of avowed hindrance to the Allied cause. In 1947 she became governor of the United
Provinces (now Uttar Pradesh), a post she retained until her death.
Sarojini Naidu also led an active literary life and attracted notable Indian intellectuals to
her famous salon in Bombay (now Mumbai). Her first volume of poetry, The Golden
Threshold (1905), was followed by The Bird of Time (1912), and in 1914 she was elected a
fellow of the Royal Society of Literature. Her collected poems, all of which she wrote in
English, have been published under the titles The Sceptred Flute (1928) and The Feather of
the Dawn (1961).

Saya San
Saya San, Saya also spelled Hsaya, original name Ya Gyaw, (born Oct. 24, 1876, East
Thayet-kan, Shwebo district, Burma [Myanmar]—died Nov. 16, 1931, Tharrawaddy),
leader of the anti-British rebellion of 1930–32 in Burma (Myanmar).
Saya San was a native of Shwebo, a centre of nationalist-monarchist sentiment in north-
central Burma that was the birthplace of the Konbaung (or Alaungpaya) dynasty, which
controlled Myanmar from 1752 until the British annexation in 1886. He was a Buddhist
monk, physician, and astrologer in Siam (Thailand) and Burma before the rebellion. Saya
San joined the extreme nationalist faction of the General Council of Burmese Associations
led by U Soe Thein. Saya San organized peasant discontent and proclaimed himself a
pretender to the throne who, like Alaungpaya, would unite the people and expel the British
invader. He organized his followers into the “Galon Army” (Galon, or Garuḍa, is a fabulous
bird of Hindu mythology), and he was proclaimed “king” at Insein, near Rangoon
(Yangon), on Oct. 28, 1930.
On the night of December 22/23 the first outbreak occurred in the Tharrawaddy district; the
revolt soon spread to other Irrawaddy delta districts. The Galon army rebels, like the
Boxers of China, carried charms and tattoos to make themselves invulnerable to British
bullets. Armed only with swords and spears, Saya San’s rebels were no match for British
troops with machine guns.
As the revolt collapsed, Saya San fled to the Shan Plateau in the east. On Aug. 2, 1931,
however, he was captured at Hokho and brought back to Tharrawaddy to be tried by a
special tribunal. Despite the efforts of his lawyer, Ba Maw, he was sentenced to death in
March 1931 and was hanged at Tharrawaddy jail. The revolt was crushed, but more than
10,000 peasants were killed in the process.
Although Saya San’s revolt was basically political (it was the last genuine attempt to
restore the Burmese monarchy) and possessed strong religious characteristics, its causes
were basically economic. The peasants of southern Burma had been dispossessed by Indian
moneylenders, were burdened with heavy taxes, and were left penniless when the price of
rice dropped in an economic depression. Widespread support for Saya San betrayed the
precarious and unpopular position of British rule in Burma.

Sayyid Maxamed Cabdulle Xasan
Sayyid Maxamed Cabdulle Xasan, also spelled Mohammed Abdullah Hassan, (born
April 7, 1864, Dulbahante area, British Somaliland [now Doli Bahanta, Somalia]—died
Dec. 21, 1920, Imi, Ethiopia), Somali religious and nationalist leader (called the “Mad
Mullah” by the British) who for 20 years led armed resistance to the British, Italian, and
Ethiopian colonial forces in Somaliland. Because of his active resistance to the British and
his vision of a Somalia united in a Muslim brotherhood transcending clan divisions, Sayyid
Maxamed is seen as a forerunner of modern Somali nationalism. He also is revered for his
skill as an oral poet.
Maxamed’s father belonged to a clan from the Ogaden region of Ethiopia, but he was
raised among his mother’s Dulbahante clan. At a young age he showed great learning in the
Qurʾān, and, during a pilgrimage to Mecca in 1894, he joined the Ṣaliḥīyah, a militant,
reformist, and puritanical Ṣūfī order. Soon after his return to Somaliland, he began urging
the expulsion of the English “infidels” and their missionaries and a strict observance by all
Somalis of the Islamic faith. Through his stirring oratory and didactic verse (some of his
poems are considered classics in Somalia), Maxamed attracted a fanatical group of
followers who became known as dervishes. In 1899 he declared a holy war (jihad) on the
colonial powers and their Somali collaborators. Between 1900 and 1904, four major
British, Ethiopian, and Italian expeditions were made against Maxamed. By 1905 he was
forced to conclude a truce, under which he and his followers constructed a small theocratic
state in the Italian protectorate. In 1908 he began his holy war again, winning a major
victory at Dulmadobe in 1913. Early in 1920, however, the dervish stronghold at Taalex
(Taleh) was bombed, and Maxamed escaped to the Ogaden, where he died of influenza.
With his death the dervish rebellion ceased.

Sheikh Muhammad Abdullah
Sheikh Muhammad Abdullah, byname Lion of Kashmir, (born December 5, 1905,
Soura, near Srinagar, Kashmir [now in Jammu and Kashmir state], India—died September
8, 1982, Srinagar), prominent figure in India’s struggle for independence from British rule,
who fought for the rights of the Kashmir region. He won a semiautonomous status for
Jammu and Kashmir state within independent India, a status which the state continued to
enjoy into the 21st century until its autonomy was suspended in 2019.
Abdullah was educated at the Prince of Wales College (Jammu) and the Islamia College
(Lahore; now in Pakistan) and received a master’s degree in physics from Aligarh Muslim
University in 1930. He championed the rights of the Muslim majority in the Kashmir
region during British rule in India and fought against the discrimination exercised by the
Hindu ruling house there. In 1932, after Abdullah served the first of what would be many
terms of imprisonment, he founded a political party, the All Jammu and Kashmir Muslim
Conference, which seven years later was renamed the Jammu and Kashmir National
Conference (JKNC). He supported the concept of a secular state, and, when India achieved
independence in 1947, he strongly opposed the idea of Kashmir’s joining Muslim Pakistan.
In 1948 Abdullah became prime minister (head of government; from 1965 called chief
minister) of Jammu and Kashmir state. Despite his early support for Indian leader
Jawaharlal Nehru, many Indians believed that Abdullah’s ultimate aim was independence
for Kashmir; therefore, in 1953 he was dismissed and imprisoned. During the next 11 years
he refused to pledge his loyalty to India and spent most of the time under detention. When
he was released by Nehru in 1964, he received an enthusiastic reception from the Kashmiri
people. In subsequent talks with the Indian government, he worked out the basis of a
possible solution to the Kashmir problem.
He was dispatched on a foreign tour to gain the goodwill of Pakistan and Algeria, but
India’s relations with Pakistan had by then deteriorated, and Abdullah’s foreign tour came
to be seen as seditious by the Indian government. At the same time, his support in Jammu
and Kashmir had been eroded by the apparent lack of progress in negotiations with India.
Abdullah was again arrested and was not released until 1968. From then until his
appointment as chief minister of Jammu and Kashmir in 1975 (following the signing of an
accord that finalized the status of the state), his Plebiscite Front party (a splinter group of
the JKNC) gained some successes, but it lost to the Indian National Congress (Congress
Party) in the 1972 state legislative assembly elections. He subsequently reunited with the

2/2
JKNC, and the party won a solid victory in the 1977 assembly elections. Abdullah was
again named chief minister and served in that post until his death.
Abdullah’s relations with Indian Prime Minister Indira Gandhi were sometimes strained,
but the 1975 accord he negotiated with her allowed Jammu and Kashmir to continue a form
of autonomy within the Indian union. His government was later accused of corruption, but,
though his popularity waned, he was still admired for his outstanding contribution to the
cause of Kashmiri national rights. Upon his death, his son, Farooq Abdullah, succeeded
him as leader of the JKNC. Farooq was then succeeded as leader by his son, Omar
Abdullah, in 2002, but Farooq again took over the party’s leadership in 2009. Jammu and
Kashmir lost its autonomy in 2019, but the JKNC continued to advocate for its restoration.

Shukri al-Quwatli
Shukri al-Quwatli, (born 1891, Damascus [Syria]—
died June 30, 1967, Beirut, Leb.), statesman who led
the anticolonialist movement in Syria and became the
nation’s first president.
Quwatli entered Syrian politics in the 1930s as a
member of the National Bloc, an Arab group that led the opposition to French rule. Quwatli
assumed leadership of the movement in 1940. His tolerance for the corruption of his
associates helped keep him in power. The National Bloc remained the dominant expression

Quwatli president. His major concern was to conclude a treaty with France, which had
exercised control over Syria for more than 20 years. This was accomplished with British
help, and by 1946 all foreign troops had left. In 1947 Quwatli enacted an amendment that
removed a one-term limit from the constitution, and he was reelected in 1948.
Because of the Israeli victory over Arab forces (1948), as well as dissatisfaction with
Quwatli’s rule, he was overthrown by a military coup in March 1949. After a short
imprisonment, he went into exile in Egypt, waiting for a chance to regain his position,
while a series of coups paralyzed Syrian political life. Free elections once again took place
in 1955, and Quwatli, at the head of the National Party (the successor to the National Bloc),
was elected president. By then his post was largely ceremonial, however, and he had little
influence on Syria’s domestic politics thereafter.

Sir Charles Gavan Duffy
Sir Charles Gavan Duffy, (born April 12, 1816,
County Monaghan, Ire.—died Feb. 9, 1903, Nice,
Fr.), Irish nationalist who later became an Australian
political leader.
While studying law in Dublin, Duffy, along with John
Blake Dillon and Thomas Davis, founded the Nation
(1842), a weekly journal of Irish nationalist opinion. Later he and his two colleagues
formed the “Young Ireland” party, which advocated Irish independence. Duffy was seized
just before an abortive attempt at insurrection (August 1848) and imprisoned until 1849. In
1852 he was elected to Parliament for New Ross, County Wexford, and in that body he
organized an independent opposition of some 50 Irish members to obstruct any government
that did not support the demands of the Irish Tenant League. His tactics foreshadowed
those of Charles Stewart Parnell, but Duffy’s efforts were frustrated by factionalism and by
lack of support from the Irish clergy, who thought him too radical.
Duffy retired from Irish politics in 1855, and, leaving Ireland, he said, “as a corpse on a
dissecting table,” he went to Australia. He practiced law in Melbourne and was elected to
the Victoria House of Assembly in 1856. After becoming minister of that state’s land and
works (1857), he promoted an important land act. He served as prime minister of Victoria
in 1871–72, was knighted in 1873, and was speaker of the Victoria House of Assembly
from 1877 to 1880. He thereafter retired to southern France to write his memoirs, which
form a principal source for the history of Ireland in the period. His books include The
League of North and South, 1850–54 (1886) and My Life in Two Hemispheres (1898).

Sir Dawda Kairaba Jawara
Sir Dawda Kairaba Jawara, (born May 16, 1924, Barajally, MacCarthy Island, The
Gambia—died August 27, 2019, Fajara), politician and veterinarian who was The Gambia’s
prime minister from 1962 to 1970 and its president from 1970 until he was overthrown in
1994.
The son of a Mande trader, Jawara was educated at a Methodist boys’ school, studied
veterinary medicine at the University of Glasgow in Scotland, and qualified as a veterinary
surgeon in 1953. Returning to The Gambia, he became principal veterinary officer of that
British colony in 1957. Jawara had become interested in politics, and in 1959 he joined the
Protectorate People’s Party. He changed its name to the People’s Progressive Party and
became its leader. In the elections of 1960 he won a seat in the Gambian legislature and
was appointed minister of education in the government. He resigned his ministerial post in
1961 when the British government picked a rival Gambian leader to serve as the country’s
interim prime minister preparatory to new elections.
The People’s Progressive Party won the general elections of 1962, and Jawara became The
Gambia’s prime minister. He led his country into independence from Great Britain three
years later. Under his leadership, the tiny nation of The Gambia became one of Africa’s few
successful parliamentary democracies; Jawara’s ruling People’s Progressive Party won six
successive elections (1966, 1972, 1977, 1982, 1987, 1992) under completely free
conditions after independence in 1965. He was knighted in 1966. Jawara served as
president from 1970, when a republican constitution was adopted to replace the former
monarchy under the British sovereign. Jawara survived an attempted coup in 1981 with
help from neighbouring Senegal, with which Gambia joined in a confederation called
Senegambia from 1981 to 1989.
Jawara was overthrown in July 1994 in a military coup led by Capt. (later Col.) Yahya
Jammeh. Jawara and his family were given asylum in Senegal and later lived in exile in
London. In late 2001 Jammeh granted amnesty to Jawara, who returned to The Gambia in
2002. Although Jawara was barred from participating in national politics, he was active in
regional affairs through his work with the Economic Community of West African States.

Sir Henry Campbell-Bannerman
Sir Henry Campbell-Bannerman, original name
Henry Campbell, (born September 7, 1836,
Glasgow, Scotland—died April 22, 1908, London,
England), British prime minister from December 5,
1905, to April 5, 1908. His popularity unified his own
Liberal Party and the unusually strong cabinet that he
headed. He took the lead in granting self-government to the Transvaal (1906) and the
Orange River Colony (1907), thereby securing the Boers’ loyalty to the British Empire
despite their recent defeat by the British in the South African War (1899–1902).
A member of the House of Commons from 1868, Campbell-Bannerman (who in 1871
added his mother’s family surname to that of his father) served as financial secretary to the
War Office (1871–74, 1880–82), parliamentary and financial secretary to the Admiralty and
spokesman for the Admiralty in the Commons (1882–84), chief secretary for Ireland
(1884–85), and secretary of state for war (1886, 1892–95). On June 21, 1895, he induced
the Duke of Cambridge, a cousin of Queen Victoria, to retire as commander in chief of the
armed forces. During his 39-year tenure the duke had blocked army reform, and the queen,
recognizing the necessity of the change, rewarded Campbell-Bannerman with a
knighthood. At the same time, however, a Commons vote, taken with few Liberals present,
on a Conservative motion to reduce Campbell-Bannerman’s salary resulted in a defeat for
the government and the resignation of the 5th Earl of Rosebery’s ministry.
On Feb. 6, 1899, Campbell-Bannerman was elected leader in the Commons of the badly
divided Liberal Party. During the South African War he at first pursued a middle course
between the imperialists and the antiwar “pro-Boers” among the Liberals. On June 14,
1901, however, he exacerbated party disunity by condemning the British “methods of
barbarism in South Africa.” The Liberal imperialists’ threatened secession from the party
was averted, and the end of the war a year later eased party tensions, as did Campbell-
Bannerman’s “step by step” approach to the divisive issue of Irish Home Rule.
After the resignation of the Conservative prime minister Arthur James Balfour late in 1905,
Campbell-Bannerman accepted the post from King Edward VII, whose friend he had
become. His cabinet included two future prime ministers, Herbert Henry Asquith
(afterward 1st Earl of Oxford and Asquith), who had been a Liberal imperialist, and David
Lloyd George, who had been “pro-Boer,” and also included the first person from the

working class ever to attain cabinet rank in Great Britain, John Elliot Burns. The general
election of January 1906 produced a large Liberal majority in the Commons, but much of
the Campbell-Bannerman legislative program was nullified by the House of Lords. He
obtained, however, the peers’ approval of the Trades Disputes Act of 1906, which gave
labour unions considerable freedom to strike. Self-government for the Transvaal and the
Orange River Colony was conceded by letters patent, over which the Lords had no control.
In 1907 Campbell-Bannerman’s health began to fail, and, 17 days before his death, he
resigned in favour of Asquith.

Sir Milton Margai
Sir Milton Margai, (born December 1895, Gbangbatok, Sierra Leone—died April 28,
1964, Freetown), first prime minister of Sierra Leone, a conservative, pro-British politician
who came to power with the backing of a coalition of traditional chiefs and elite modernists
from the Protectorate—the part of Sierra Leone that became a British colony at the end of
the 19th century.
The grandson of a paramount chief and the first physician from the Protectorate (1926),
Margai worked in the government medical service until 1950, during which time he built
up lasting contacts and loyalties. His active political career began after World War II, when
he joined the Sierra Leone Organization Society, an antipopulist though moderately
progressive party. In 1951 he founded the Sierra Leone People’s Party, which gained the
support of Protectorate chiefs, on whom he depended to assure the allegiance of the rural
populations and whom he supported in turn against populist demands and pressures. As the
majority leader in the Legislative Council he was appointed to the Executive Council and
later, as minister of health, he became one of the first Africans to hold a ministerial post. In
1953–54 he was made chief minister (later premier) as well as minister of agriculture,
health, and forests. Later in the 1950s he also held the posts of attorney general and
minister for internal affairs.
Although he easily won the elections of 1957, Margai was challenged within the People’s
Party by his younger brother Albert, who accused him of being too moderate and cautious.
In 1958 Albert left to form his own party, the People’s National Party, which was defeated
in district elections in 1959. That same year Margai formed a united front to hold talks in
London for independence, which was granted in 1961. His coalition government, with
many former opposition leaders in his Cabinet, lasted from 1959 until his death, after
which he was succeeded by his brother Albert. Margai had been knighted in 1959.

Sir Percy Cox
Sir Percy Cox, in full Sir Percy Zachariah Cox, (born
November 20, 1864, Herongate, Essex, England—died
February 20, 1937, Melchbourne, Bedfordshire), diplomat
who was especially important in the development of
independent Iraq from a British mandated territory after
World War I. Interpreting the mandate favourably to Iraqi
interests, he oversaw the transition from a provisional and largely military regime to a
national government under King Fayṣal I.
Educated at the Royal Military Academy, Sandhurst, he served in the army in India from
1884 to 1890, when he joined the Indian political service. From 1893 to 1914 he held
various political posts in the Persian Gulf area and Persia. He was knighted in 1911. During
World War I, as chief political officer of the Indian Expeditionary Force, Cox was
responsible for all relations with local authorities in British-occupied Iraq. From 1918 to
1920 he acted as British minister to Persia.
In October 1920 Cox went to Baghdad as British high commissioner to the new state of
Iraq, which had been placed under British mandate by the Supreme Allied Council earlier
that year. He established an all-Iraqi ministry and provincial administration, subject to
British supervision; organized an Iraqi army; and conducted the referendum in which the
emir Fayṣal was elected king as Fayṣal I (crowned August 23, 1921). Cox and Fayṣal
shared the credit for overcoming serious difficulties in establishing the constitution and the
political structure of the nation. On October 10, 1922, Cox signed the Anglo-Iraq Treaty
(not ratified by Iraq until 1924), which provided for a 20-year alliance, later reduced to 4
years. He retired in May 1923.

Sir Richard Church, (born 1784, Cork, County Cork,
Ire.—died March 30, 1873, Athens), British soldier and
Philhellene, commander of the Greek forces during the
War of Greek Independence.
The second son of a Quaker merchant, he ran away
from school to join the army, becoming an ensign in the 13th (Somersetshire) Light
Infantry and serving under Sir Ralph Abercromby in Egypt in 1801. He accompanied the
expedition (1809) to the Ionian Islands, where he met Theódoros Kolokotrónis and other
Greeks in exile. Already sympathetic toward ideas of Greek independence, he afterward
obtained permission to form two Greek regiments in English pay in order to give the
Greeks military training, but the regiments were later disbanded. In vain, Church pleaded
the Greek cause not only in London but at the Congress of Vienna (1814–15). He was
knighted in 1822. In March 1827 he went to Greece to fight in the war of independence and
in the following month was appointed commander in chief of the Greek forces. In 1829,
after his campaigns in western Greece, Church resigned his command because he opposed
the government of Count Kapodístrias. Later appointed confidential adviser to Sir Edmund
(later Baron) Lyons, first British minister to Greece, he also played a conspicuous part in
the revolution of 1843.

Sir Roger Casement
Sir Roger Casement, in full Sir Roger David Casement, (born Sept. 1, 1864, Kingstown
[now Dún Laoghaire], County Dublin, Ire.—died Aug. 3, 1916, London, Eng.),
distinguished British public servant who was executed for treason and became one of the
principal Irish martyrs in the revolt against British rule in Ireland.
Casement was a British consul in Portuguese East Africa (Mozambique; 1895–98), Angola
(1898–1900), Congo Free State (1901–04), and Brazil (1906–11). He gained international
fame for revealing atrocious cruelty in the exploitation of native labour by white traders in
the Congo and the Putumayo River region, Peru; his Congo report (published 1904) led to a
major reorganization of Belgian rule in the Congo (1908), and his Putumayo report (1912)
earned him a knighthood.
Ill health forced Casement to retire to Ireland in 1912. Although he came from an Ulster
Protestant family, he had always sympathized with the predominantly Roman Catholic Irish
nationalists. Late in 1913 he helped form the Irish National Volunteers, and in July 1914 he
traveled to New York City to seek American aid for that anti-British force. After World War
I broke out in August, Casement hoped that Germany might assist the Irish independence
movement as a blow against Great Britain. On arriving in Berlin in November 1914, he
found that the German government was unwilling to risk an expedition to Ireland and that
most Irish prisoners of war would refuse to join a brigade that he intended to recruit for
service against England.
Later, Casement failed to obtain the loan of German army officers to lead the Irish rising
planned for Easter 1916. In a vain effort to prevent the revolt, he sailed for Ireland on April
12 in a German submarine. Put ashore near Tralee, County Kerry, he was arrested on April
24 and taken to London, where, on June 29, he was convicted of treason and sentenced to
death. An appeal was dismissed, and he was hanged at Pentonville Prison despite attempts
by influential Englishmen to secure a reprieve in view of his past services to the British
government. During this time, diaries reputedly written by Casement and containing
detailed descriptions of homosexual practices were circulated privately among British
officials. After years of dispute over their authenticity, the diaries were made available to
scholars by the British home secretary in July 1959. It was generally considered that the
passages in question were in Casement’s handwriting.

After World War I broke out in August, Casement hoped that Germany might assist the Irish independence movement as a blow against Great Britain. On arriving in Berlin in November 1914, he found that the German government was unwilling to risk an expedition to Ireland and that most Irish prisoners of war would refuse to join a brigade that he intended to recruit for service against England. Later, Casement failed to obtain the loan of German army officers to lead the Irish rising planned for Easter 1916. In a vain effort to prevent the revolt, he sailed for Ireland on April 12 in a German submarine. Put ashore near Tralee, County Kerry, he was arrested on April 24 and taken to London, where, on June 29, he was convicted of treason and sentenced to death. An appeal was dismissed, and he was hanged at Pentonville Prison despite attempts by influential Englishmen to secure a reprieve in view of his past services to the British government. During this time, diaries reputedly written by Casement and containing detailed descriptions of homosexual practices were circulated privately among British officials. After years of dispute over their authenticity, the diaries were made available to scholars by the British home secretary in July 1959. It was generally considered that the passages in question were in Casement’s handwriting. Sir Roger Casement   In 1965 Casement’s remains were returned to Ireland and, after a state funeral, reinterred in Dublin.",

Seoul: Son Pyǒng-Hi monument
Son Pyŏng-Hi
Son Pyŏng-Hi, also spelled Son Pyŏng-Hui or Son Byeong-Hui, (born 1861—died 1922),
Korean independence activist who was the third leader of the apocalyptic, antiforeign
Tonghak (or Donghak; later, Ch’ondogyo) religious sect.
Born the illegitimate son of a low-echelon
government official, Son grew up in poverty,
suffering much discrimination. In 1897 he was
elected to the leadership of Tonghak, succeeding
Ch’oe Si-Hyŏng, and he successfully reconstructed
the sect, which had been hurt by the failure of the
Tonghak Uprising of 1894–95.
Branded a political criminal by the state, he went into exile in Japan. When Korea lost its
sovereignty to Japan in 1905, he renamed the Tonghak sect the Ch’ŏndogyo (“Religion of
the Heavenly Way”) and set about reorganizing it as a genuine religion. He undertook
educational and cultural projects, running or supporting schools, conducting enlightenment
programs for Ch’ŏndogyo followers, and leading campaigns for constructive living. In
1919 he was one of the leaders of the March First Movement, a series of nationwide
demonstrations for Korean independence.

Souphanouvong
Souphanouvong, (born July 13, 1909, Luang Prabang, Laos—died Jan. 9, 1995, Laos),
leader of the revolutionary Pathet Lao movement and first president of Communist-
governed Laos.
Souphanouvong, half brother of the Lao premier Souvanna Phouma, was born a prince, a
son of Viceroy Boun Khong of Luang Prabang. He was trained in civil engineering in
France, and, under the French Indochina administration, he built bridges and roads in
Vietnam (1938–45). After World War II he opposed the reimposition of French rule in Laos
and joined the nationalist provisional government in Vientiane as defense minister. After a
period as foreign minister of the Free Lao government-in-exile in Bangkok (1947–48), he
broke with it to ally with the Viet Minh, with whose aid he formed the Communist-oriented
Pathet Lao in 1950. After more than a decade in opposition, he joined the coalition
government set up by Souvanna Phouma in 1962. When it collapsed a year later, he
escaped to northern provinces administered by the Pathet Lao and its political wing, the
Neo Lao Hak Xat, and resumed the Laotian civil war. As the Pathet Lao was establishing
control over the whole of Laos in 1974–75, Souphanouvong returned to Vientiane to head
the National Political Council; and, when a republic was proclaimed in late 1975, he
became president (ceremonial head of state) and served on the Politburo of the Laotian
Communist Party. He resigned from the presidency for reasons of health in 1986.

Sri Aurobindo
Sri Aurobindo, original name Aurobindo Ghose, Aurobindo also spelled Aravinda, Sri
also spelled Shri, (born August 15, 1872, Calcutta [now Kolkata], India—died December
5, 1950, Pondicherry [now Puducherry]), yogi, seer, philosopher, poet, and Indian
nationalist who propounded a philosophy of divine life on earth through spiritual evolution.
Aurobindo’s education began in a Christian convent school in Darjeeling (Darjiling). While
still a boy, he was sent to England for further schooling. He entered the University of
Cambridge, where he became proficient in two classical and several modern European
languages. After returning to India in 1892, he held various administrative and professorial
posts in Baroda (Vadodara) and Calcutta (Kolkata). Turning to his native culture, he began
the serious study of Yoga and Indian languages, including classical Sanskrit.
From 1902 to 1910 Aurobindo partook in the struggle to free India from the British raj
(rule). As a result of his political activities, he was imprisoned in 1908. Two years later he
fled British India and found refuge in the French colony of Pondichéry (Puducherry) in
southeastern India, where he devoted himself for the rest of his life to the development of
his “integral” yoga, which was characterized by its holistic approach and its aim of a
fulfilled and spiritually transformed life on earth.
In Pondichéry he founded a community of spiritual seekers, which took shape as the Sri
Aurobindo Ashram in 1926. In that year he entrusted the work of guiding the seekers to his
spiritual collaborator, Mirra Alfassa (1878–1973), who was called “the Mother” in the
ashram. The ashram eventually attracted seekers from many countries throughout the
world.
The evolutionary philosophy underlying Aurobindo’s integral yoga is explored in his main
prose work, The Life Divine (1939). Rejecting the traditional Indian approach of striving
for moksha (liberation from the cyle of death and rebirth, or samsara) as a means of
reaching happier, transcendental planes of existence, Aurobindo held that terrestrial life
itself, in its higher evolutionary stages, is the real goal of creation. He believed that the
basic principles of matter, life, and mind would be succeeded through terrestrial evolution
by the principle of supermind as an intermediate power between the two spheres of the
infinite and the finite. Such a future consciousness would help to create a joyful life in
keeping with the highest goal of creation, expressing values such as love, harmony, unity

and knowledge and successfully overcoming the age-old resistance of dark forces against
efforts to manifest the divine on earth.
Aurobindo’s voluminous literary output comprises philosophical speculation, many
treatises on yoga and integral yoga, poetry, plays, and other writings. In addition to The
Life Divine, his major works include Essays on the Gita (1922), Collected Poems and Plays
(1942), The Synthesis of Yoga (1948), The Human Cycle (1949), The Ideal of Human Unity
(1949), Savitri: A Legend and a Symbol (1950), and On the Veda (1956).

Stanisław Wojciechowski
Stanisław Wojciechowski, (born March 15, 1869, Kalisz, Pol., Russian Empire—died
April 9, 1953, Golabki, Pol.), one of the leaders in the struggle for Polish independence
from Russia in the years before World War I. He later served as the second president of the
Polish Republic (1922–26).
While a student at the University of Warsaw, Wojciechowski worked for the Polish
Socialist movement, which was a major force in the independence effort. He was arrested
in 1891, and upon his release a year later he went to Paris and then to London. In England
he helped publish the Polish Socialist periodical Przedświt (“The Dawn”) and became
friends with Józef Piłsudski. He also studied the cooperative movement, and on returning
to Poland in 1906 he spent his time working to develop Polish cooperatives.
During World War I, because he saw Germany as Poland’s main enemy, Wojciechowski in
1915 went to Moscow, and there in 1917 he was elected president of the Council of Polish
Parties’ Union. He returned to Warsaw at the end of the war and from January 1919 to July
1920 served as minister of the interior in three separate cabinets of the new Polish
Republic. He was elected to the Sejm (Diet) as a member of the Polish Peasant Party in
November 1922. When Gabriel Narutowicz, president of the republic, was assassinated in
December 1922, Wojciechowski was chosen to succeed him.
In the new government Wojciechowski and Piłsudski, then military chief of staff, differed
as to the direction the nation should take. Wojciechowski supported continued
parliamentary government, while Piłsudski favoured a more authoritarian approach. In May
1926, Piłsudski staged a successful coup d’état. Wojciechowski then retired to private life.

Stephen Austin
Stephen Austin, in full Stephen Fuller Austin, (born
November 3, 1793, Austinville, Virginia, U.S.—died
December 27, 1836, Columbia, Republic of Texas
[now West Columbia, Texas]), founder in the 1820s
of the principal settlements of English-speaking
people in Texas when that territory was still part of
Mexico.
Raised on the Missouri frontier, Austin was educated at Transylvania University in
Lexington, Kentucky, and served in the Missouri territorial legislature (1814–19). The
economic panic of 1819 led his father, Moses Austin (1767–1821), to leave his lead-mining
business in Missouri and embark upon a scheme of colonization in Texas. Moses obtained a
grant of land from the Mexican government but died soon thereafter, and in 1821 Stephen
went to Texas to carry out his father’s project. He founded a colony (1822) of several
hundred families on the Brazos River, and for some years thereafter, as the migration of
U.S. citizens to Texas increased, he was a major figure in the struggle between Mexico and
the United States for possession of the territory.
A skillful diplomat, Austin served the interests of Anglo-American slaveholders by
defeating an effort to ban slavery in Texas. He tried to induce the Mexican government to
make Texas a separate state in the confederation so that the American settlers might have
the liberty and self-government that they considered indispensable to further their interests
independently of the wishes of the country’s Hispanic and Roman Catholic rulers. When
this attempt failed, he recommended in 1833 the organization of a state without waiting for
the consent of the Mexican Congress, and he was thrown in prison. He was released in
1835, and, when the Texas revolution broke out in October of that year, he went to the
United States to secure help. Returning in June 1836, he was defeated by Sam Houston for
the presidency of the new Republic of Texas and served briefly as secretary of state until
his death.

Subhas Chandra Bose
Subhas Chandra Bose
Subhas Chandra Bose, byname Netaji (Hindi:
“Respected Leader”), (born c. January 23, 1897,
Cuttack, Orissa [now Odisha], India—died August
18, 1945, Taipei, Taiwan?), Indian revolutionary
prominent in the independence movement against
British rule of India. He also led an Indian national
force from abroad against the Western powers during
World War II. He was a contemporary of Mohandas K. Gandhi, at times an ally and at other
times an adversary. Bose was known in particular for his militant approach to independence
and for his push for socialist policies.
Early life and political activity
The son of a wealthy and prominent Bengali lawyer, Bose studied at Presidency College,
Calcutta (Kolkata), from which he was expelled in 1916 for nationalist activities, and the
Scottish Churches College (graduating in 1919). He then was sent by his parents to the
University of Cambridge in England to prepare for the Indian Civil Service. In 1920 he
passed the civil service examination, but in April 1921, after hearing of the nationalist
turmoils in India, he resigned his candidacy and hurried back to India. Throughout his
career, especially in its early stages, he was supported financially and emotionally by an
elder brother, Sarat Chandra Bose (1889–1950), a wealthy Calcutta lawyer and Indian
National Congress (also known as the Congress Party) politician.
Bose joined the noncooperation movement started by Mohandas K. Gandhi, who had made
the Indian National Congress a powerful nonviolent organization. Bose was advised by
Gandhi to work under Chitta Ranjan Das, a politician in Bengal. There Bose became a
youth educator, journalist, and commandant of the Bengal Congress volunteers. His
activities led to his imprisonment in December 1921. In 1924 he was appointed chief
executive officer of the Calcutta Municipal Corporation, with Das as mayor. Bose was soon
after deported to Burma (Myanmar) because he was suspected of connections with secret
revolutionary movements. Released in 1927, he returned to find Bengal Congress affairs in
disarray after the death of Das, and Bose was elected president of the Bengal Congress.
Shortly thereafter he and Jawaharlal Nehru became the two general secretaries of the
Indian National Congress. Together they represented the more militant, left-wing faction of
the party against the more compromising, right-wing Gandhian faction.

A falling-out with Gandhi
Vocal support for Gandhi increased within the Indian National Congress, meanwhile, and,
in light of this, Gandhi resumed a more commanding role in the party. When the civil
disobedience movement was started in 1930, Bose was already in detention for his
associations with an underground revolutionary group, the Bengal Volunteers.
Nevertheless, he was elected mayor of Calcutta while in prison. Released and then
rearrested several times for his suspected role in violent acts, Bose was finally allowed to
proceed to Europe after he contracted tuberculosis and was released for ill health. In
enforced exile and still ill, he wrote The Indian Struggle, 1920–1934 and pleaded India’s
cause with European leaders. He returned from Europe in 1936, was again taken into
custody, and was released after a year.
Meanwhile, Bose became increasingly critical of Gandhi’s more conservative economics as
well as his less confrontational approach toward independence. In 1938 he was elected
president of the Indian National Congress and formed a national planning committee,
which formulated a policy of broad industrialization. However, this did not harmonize with
Gandhian economic thought, which clung to the notion of cottage industries and benefiting
from the use of the country’s own resources. Bose’s vindication came in 1939, when he
defeated a Gandhian rival for reelection. Nonetheless, the “rebel president” felt bound to
resign because of the lack of Gandhi’s support. He founded the Forward Bloc, hoping to
rally radical elements, but was again incarcerated in July 1940. His refusal to remain in
prison at this critical period of India’s history was expressed in a determination to fast to
death, which frightened the British government into releasing him. On January 26, 1941,
though closely watched, he escaped from his Calcutta residence in disguise and, traveling
via Kabul and Moscow, eventually reached Germany in April.
Activity in exile
In Nazi Germany Bose came under the tutelage of a newly created Special Bureau for
India, guided by Adam von Trott zu Solz. He and other Indians who had gathered in Berlin
made regular broadcasts from the German-sponsored Azad Hind Radio beginning in
January 1942, speaking in English, Hindi, Bengali, Tamil, Telugu, Gujarati, and Pashto.
A little more than a year after the Japanese invasion of Southeast Asia, Bose left Germany,
traveling by German and Japanese submarines and by plane, and arrived in May 1943 in
Tokyo. On July 4 he assumed leadership of the Indian Independence Movement in East
Asia and proceeded, with Japanese aid and influence, to form a trained army of about

40,000 troops in Japanese-occupied Southeast Asia.
On October 21, 1943, Bose proclaimed the
establishment of a provisional independent Indian
government, and his so-called Indian National Army
(Azad Hind Fauj), alongside Japanese troops,
advanced to Rangoon (Yangon) and thence overland
into India, reaching Indian soil on March 18, 1944,
and moving into Kohima and the plains of Imphal. In a stubborn battle, the mixed Indian
and Japanese forces, lacking Japanese air support, were defeated and forced to retreat; the
Indian National Army nevertheless for some time succeeded in maintaining its identity as a
liberation army, based in Burma and then Indochina. With the defeat of Japan, however,
Bose’s fortunes ended.
A few days after Japan’s announced surrender in August 1945, Bose, fleeing Southeast
Asia, reportedly died in a Japanese hospital in Taiwan as a result of burn injuries from a
plane crash.

Sukarno
Sukarno
Sukarno, also spelled Soekarno, (born June 6, 1901,
Surabaja [now Surabaya], Java, Dutch East Indies—
died June 21, 1970, Jakarta, Indonesia), leader of the
Indonesian independence movement and Indonesia’s
first president (1949–66), who suppressed the
country’s original parliamentary system in favour of
an authoritarian “Guided Democracy” and who
attempted to balance the Communists against the army leaders. He was deposed in 1966 by
the army under Suharto.
Early life and education
Sukarno was the only son of a poor Javanese schoolteacher, Raden Sukemi Sosrodihardjo,
and his Balinese wife, Ida Njoman Rai. Originally named Kusnasosro, he was given a new
and, it was hoped, more auspicious name, Sukarno, after a series of illnesses. Known to his
childhood playmates as Djago (Cock, Champion) for his looks, spirits, and prowess, he was
as an adult best known as Bung Karno (bung, “brother” or “comrade”), the revolutionary
hero and architect of merdeka (“independence”).
Sukarno spent long periods of his childhood with his grandparents in the village of
Tulungagung, where he was exposed to the animism and mysticism of serene rural Java.
There he became a lifelong devotee of wayang, the puppet shadow plays based on the
Hindu epics, as animated and narrated by a master puppeteer, who could hold an audience
spellbound through an entire night. As a youth of 15, Sukarno was sent to secondary school
in Surabaya and to lodgings in the home of Omar Said Tjokroaminoto, a prominent civic
and religious figure. Tjokroaminoto treated him as a cherished foster son and protégé,
financed his further education, and eventually married him off at age 20 to his own 16-
year-old daughter, Siti Utari.
As a student, Sukarno chose to excel mainly in languages. He mastered Javanese,
Sundanese, Balinese, and modern Indonesian, which, in fact, he did much to create. He also
acquired Arabic, which, as a Muslim, he learned by study of the Qurʾān; Dutch, the
language of his education; German; French; English; and, later, Japanese. In
Tjokroaminoto’s home he came to meet emerging leaders who spanned the rapidly
widening national political spectrum, from feudal princelings to fugitive communist
1/16/23, 2:36 PM

https://www.britannica.com/print/article/572207
2/4
conspirators. The eclectic syncretism of the Tjokroaminoto ménage, like the romance and
mysticism of wayang, imprinted itself indelibly upon Sukarno’s mind and personality. He
was later to treat nation-making as a heroic theatrical, in which the clash of irreconcilable
men and ideas could be harmonized through sheer poetic magic—his own.
Endowed with commanding presence, radiant personality, mellifluous voice, vivid style, a
photographic memory, and supreme self-confidence, Sukarno was obviously destined for
greatness. In 1927 in Bandung, where he had just acquired a degree in civil engineering, he
found his true calling in oratory and politics. He soon revealed himself as a man of
charisma and destiny.
Sukarno’s amours were almost as renowned as his oratory. He divorced Siti in 1923 and
married Inggit Garnisih, divorcing her in 1943 and marrying Fatmawati, with whom he had
five children, including his eldest son, Guntur Sukarnaputra (b. 1944). As a Muslim,
Sukarno was entitled to four wives, so he took several more wives in the following
decades.
Indonesian independence
For his challenge to colonialism Sukarno spent two years in a Dutch jail (1929–31) in
Bandung and more than eight years in exile (1933–42) on Flores and Sumatra. When the
Japanese invaded the Indies in March 1942, he welcomed them as personal and national
liberators. During World War II the Japanese made Sukarno their chief adviser and
propagandist and their recruiter for labourers, soldiers, and prostitutes. Sukarno pressured
the Japanese to grant Indonesia its independence and, on June 1, 1945, made the most
famous of many celebrated speeches. In it he defined the Pantjasila (Pancasila), or Five
Principles (nationalism, internationalism, democracy, social prosperity, and belief in God),
still the sacrosanct state doctrine. When the collapse of Japan became imminent, Sukarno at
first wavered. Then, after being kidnapped, intimidated, and persuaded by activist youths,
he declared Indonesia’s independence (August 17, 1945). As president of the shaky new
republic, he fueled a successful defiance of the Dutch, who, after two abortive “police
actions” to regain control, formally transferred sovereignty on December 27, 1949.
From his revolutionary capital in Yogyakarta (formerly Jogjakarta), Sukarno returned in
triumph to Jakarta on December 28, 1949. There he established himself, his collection of
paintings, and his numerous retinue in the splendid palace of the Dutch governors-general.
He proceeded to preside urbanely over a spectacle that was at once diverting and
disturbing. His increasingly numerous and outspoken critics maintained that Sukarno

https://www.britannica.com/print/article/572207

inspired no coherent programs of national organization and administration, rehabilitation,
and development, such as were quite clearly necessary. He seemed instead to conduct a
continuous series of formal and informal audiences and a nightly soiree of receptions,
banquets, music, dancing, movies, and wayang. Indonesian politics became increasingly
frenzied, with Sukarno himself engaged in devious maneuvers that made stabilization
impossible. The Indonesian economy foundered while Sukarno encouraged the wildest of
extravagances. To be sure, the nation scored impressive gains in health, education, and
cultural self-awareness and self-expression. It achieved, in fact, what Sukarno himself most
joyously sought and acclaimed as “national identity,” an exhilarating sense of pride in
being Indonesian. But this achievement came at a ruinous cost.
After “dreaming” in late 1956 of “burying” the feuding political parties in Indonesia and
thus achieving national consensus and prosperity, Sukarno dismantled parliamentary
democracy and destroyed free enterprise. He ordained “Guided Democracy” and “Guided
Economy” for the achievement of Manipol-Usdek and Resopim-Nasakom—arcane
acronyms symbolizing policies but signifying dictatorship.
Sukarno’s personal and political excesses, as epitomized eventually by his neo-Marxist,
crypto-communist ideology and his infamous cabinet of 100 corrupt and cynical ministers,
induced a continuous state of national crisis. Sukarno narrowly escaped recurrent attempts
at assassination, the first in 1957. Regional insurrections broke out in Sumatra and
Sulawesi in 1958. Inflation escalated the cost-of-living index from 100 in 1958 to 18,000 in
1965 and on up wildly to 600,000 in 1967. In 1963, after shouting repeatedly “To hell with
your aid” (1950–65 total: U.S. $1,000,000,000), Sukarno all but broke with the United
States. After having exacted U.S. $1,000,000,000 in Soviet armaments and other items, he
next affronted Moscow.
On January 20, 1965, Indonesia formally withdrew from the United Nations because the
latter supported Malaysia, which Sukarno had vowed to “crush” as “an imperialist plot of
encirclement.” Yet, until 1965, Sukarno was still able to stir the Indonesian masses to near-
hysterical belligerency. Millions of Indonesians sang and shouted his slogans and
acclaimed Sukarno as “Great Leader of the Revolution,” “Lifetime President” (his official
title), and oracle and warrior of the Nefo—his acronym for the “New Emerging Forces”—
in violent conflict with Nekolim—the neocolonialism, capitalism, and imperialism of the
“doomed” Western powers.
The coup of 1965

Sukarno -- Britannica Online Encyclopedia
https://www.britannica.com/print/article/572207
4/4
The nation was shocked and shaken out of its trance by an abortive coup on September 30,
1965. A clique of military conspirators calling itself the September 30th Movement
kidnapped and killed six top army generals, seized a few key urban points, and proclaimed
a new revolutionary regime. General Suharto, the commander of the Jakarta garrison,
swiftly reversed the coup.
Suharto and the military generally believed the Indonesian Communist Party (Partai
Komunis Indonesia; PKI)—which to some measure had been supported and protected by
Sukarno—to be behind the attempted coup. The PKI, by contrast, understood the plot to be
entirely a military matter. There ensued an oblique contest for power between Suharto and
Sukarno, during which thousands of communists and alleged communists were slaughtered
by the military; estimates of the number of people killed during the purge range from
80,000 to more than 1,000,000. As the country recoiled in horror, activist youths demanded
the political demise of Sukarno, the Sukarnoists, and Sukarnoism and the total reform and
reorganization of the state. On March 11, 1966, Sukarno was obliged to delegate wide
powers to Suharto, who subsequently became acting president (March 1967) and then
president (March 1968), as Sukarno sank into disgrace and dotage.
Sukarno died at the age of 69 of a chronic kidney ailment and numerous complications.
Suharto decreed a quick and quiet funeral. Nevertheless, at least 500,000 persons, including
virtually all of Jakarta’s important personages, turned out to pay their last ambivalent
respects. The next day another 200,000 assembled in Blitar, near Surabaya, for the official
service followed by burial in a simple grave alongside that of his mother. The cult and
ideology of Sukarnoism were proscribed until the late 1970s, when the government
undertook a rehabilitation of Sukarno’s name. His autobiography, Sukarno, was published
in 1965.

Sutan Sjahrir
Sutan Sjahrir, (born March 5, 1909, Padangpandjang, Sumatra, Dutch East Indies [now in
Indonesia]—died April 9, 1966, Zürich, Switz.), influential Indonesian nationalist and
prime minister who favoured the adoption of Western constitutional democracy for
Indonesia.
Sjahrir, son of a public prosecutor, received a Dutch education in Sumatra and Java and
attended the Law Faculty at the University of Leiden. In the Netherlands he was a member
of a socialist student group and secretary of the student group Perhimpunan Indonesia
(“Indonesian Union”), which numbered among its members many of Indonesia’s future
political leaders. He returned to the Dutch East Indies in 1931 and helped establish the
Pendidikan Nasional Indonesia, a rival group to Partindo, the nationalist organization
formed from remnants of the suppressed Partai Nasional Indonesia (“Indonesian
Nationalist Party”), founded by Sukarno, the foremost Indonesian nationalist leader. The
groups differed on the goals and means appropriate to nationalists, with Pendidikan
opposed to Partindo’s concept of a united front of left-wing parties, and were divided by
personal antagonisms as well. Early in 1934 Sjahrir and Pendidikan’s coleader Mohammad
Hatta were exiled by the Dutch authorities and remained isolated from Indonesian politics
until the arrival of Japanese occupation forces in 1942. Sjahrir was opposed to the Japanese
but chose to withdraw from public life rather than actively resist. He pressed for the
country to declare independence before the Japanese surrender.
Sjahrir’s pamphlet “Perdjuangan Kita” (1945; “Our Struggle”) won for him the support of
militant nationalists in the capital, as well as the office of prime minister in the postwar
government at a time when executive power had been stripped from the president, then
Sukarno, and given to the prime minister. That was done at Sjahrir’s instigation, as he
feared Sukarno’s cooperation with the Japanese would hurt the republic’s image in
international opinion, on which the success of negotiations with the Dutch largely
depended. Sjahrir negotiated the Linggadjati Agreement, under which the Dutch
acknowledged Indonesia’s authority in Java and Sumatra. His conciliatory policies were
not in keeping with the temper of the times, however, and in February 1946 he had to
resign briefly, and in June 1947 he was forced to resign permanently. He then became a
member of the Indonesian delegation to the United Nations. In 1948 he formed a Socialist
party, Partai Sosialis Indonesia (PSI), which opposed the Communist Party, but it failed to
win popular support and was banned by Sukarno in 1960. On Jan. 17, 1962, Sjahrir was

arrested on charges of conspiracy. He was held without trial until 1965, when he was
allowed to travel to Switzerland for medical treatment following a stroke.

Olympio, Sylvanus
Sylvanus Olympio
Sylvanus Olympio, (born September 1902, Lomé,
Togoland [now Togo]—died Jan. 13, 1963, Lomé),
nationalist politician and first president of Togo who
was the first presidential victim of a wave of military
coups that occurred in Africa in the 1960s.
A leader of the Committee of Togolese Unity after
World War II, Olympio was elected president of the first territorial assembly in 1946 and
by 1947 was in open (though nonviolent) conflict with Togoland’s French colonial
administration. One of his main early concerns was to unite the Ewe people, who were
divided by the boundaries of British and French Togoland. His hopes were dashed in 1956,
however, when British Togoland voted by plebiscite to join the Gold Coast (which became
independent Ghana in 1957).
Between 1952 and 1958 Olympio was out of office. When Togo received limited self-
government in 1956, his rival Nicholas Grunitzky became prime minister. In UN-
supervised elections in 1958, however, Olympio’s party won an overwhelming victory, and
he became prime minister, leading Togo to complete independence in 1960. He was elected
president in 1961, under a constitution granting extensive presidential powers. Togo
became a one-party state, but its seeming stability was deceptive. Many Togolese,
especially those with Western education, resented the regime’s authoritarianism; northern
leaders felt left out of the predominantly southern government, and the more radical
members of Juvento (once the party’s youth wing) wanted Olympio to be less dependent on
French aid. By early 1963 some Juvento leaders were in detention and other opposition
figures had left the country. In January 1963 Olympio was assassinated in the first
successful army coup in postwar sub-Saharan Africa.

Symon Petlyura, in full Symon Vasylevych
Petlyura, Petlyura also spelled Petliura, (born May
10, 1879, Poltava, Ukraine, Russian Empire—died
May 25, 1926, Paris, France), socialist leader of
Ukraine’s unsuccessful fight for independence
following the Russian revolutions of 1917.
One of the founders of the Ukrainian Social-Democratic Workers’ Party in 1905, Petlyura
published two socialist weekly newspapers before the onset of World War I, when he
became an officer in the Russian army (1914). After the imperial government of Russia was
overthrown by the February Revolution (1917), he joined the Ukrainian Central Rada
(“council”), which proclaimed Ukraine to be an autonomous republic (June 1917); and in
July he was appointed secretary of military affairs for the newly formed governing council.
Soon thereafter, however, the Germans occupied Ukraine and established a puppet
government. When the Germans withdrew at the end of the war, Petlyura assumed a
leading role in Ukraine’s movement for independence, heading the five-member directorate
of the Rada, becoming ataman (“commander in chief”) of the Ukrainian army, and seizing
power from the German regime.
Petlyura’s government then had to confront hostile Soviet Russian armies as well as forces
of the anti-Bolshevik White Russians. When the White armies, which had occupied
Ukraine and replaced Petlyura’s government at the end of 1918, withdrew in the autumn of
1919, Ukraine fell under Soviet authority.
To overthrow the Soviet regime, Petlyura concluded a treaty of alliance with Józef
Piłsudski, head of the Polish state, in April 1920 and supported the Poles in their war
against Soviet Russia (Russo-Polish War of 1919–20). Although the Poles repulsed the
Soviet army, they were unable to secure independence for Ukraine when they concluded
the Treaty of Riga with the Bolsheviks (March 18, 1921).
Ukraine subsequently remained under Soviet control, and Petlyura, after spending some
months in Warsaw, moved with his government to Paris, where, several years later, he was
fatally shot by Shalom Schwartzbard, in revenge for the deaths of Jews during pogroms
staged by members of Petlyura’s army.

Syngman Rhee
Syngman Rhee
Syngman Rhee, (born March 26, 1875, P’yŏngsan,
Hwanghae province, Korea [now in North Korea]—
died July 19, 1965, Honolulu, Hawaii, U.S.), first
president of the Republic of Korea (South Korea).
Rhee completed a traditional classical Confucian
education and then entered a Methodist school, where
he learned English. He became an ardent nationalist and, ultimately, a Christian. In 1896 he
joined with other young Korean leaders to form the Independence Club, a group dedicated
to asserting Korean independence from Japan. When right-wing elements destroyed the
club in 1898, Rhee was arrested and imprisoned until 1904. On his release he went to the
United States, where in 1910 he received a Ph.D. from Princeton University, becoming the
first Korean to earn a doctorate from an American university. He returned home in 1910,
the year in which Korea was annexed by Japan.
Rhee found it impossible to hide his hostility toward Japanese rule, and, after working
briefly in a YMCA and as a high-school principal, he emigrated to Hawaii, which was then
a U.S. territory. He spent the next 30 years as a spokesman for Korean independence,
trying in vain to win international support for his cause. In 1919 he was elected (in
absentia) president of the newly established Korean Provisional Government, in Shanghai.
Rhee relocated to Shanghai the following year but returned to Hawaii in 1925. He
remained president of the Provisional Government for 20 years, eventually being pushed
out of the leadership by younger Korean nationalists centred in China. (Rhee had refused to
recognize an earlier impeachment, for misuse of his authority, by the Provisional
Government in the 1920s.) Rhee moved to Washington, D.C., and spent the World War II
years trying to secure Allied promises of Korean independence.
After the war, since Rhee was the only Korean leader well known to Americans, he was
returned to Korea ahead of the other members of the Provisional Government. He
campaigned for a policy of immediate independence and unification of the country. He
soon built up a mass political organization supported by strong-arm squads and a following
among the police. With the assassination of the major moderate leaders, including Song Jin
Woo and Chang Duk Soo, Rhee remained the most influential leader, and his new party
won the elections in South Korea. In 1948 he became president of the Republic of Korea, a
post to which he was reelected in 1952, 1956, and 1960.

As president, Rhee assumed dictatorial powers, tolerating little domestic opposition to his
program. Rhee purged the National Assembly of members who opposed him and outlawed
the opposition Progressive Party, whose leader, Cho Bong Am, was executed for treason.
He controlled the appointment of mayors, village headmen, and chiefs of police. He even
defied the United Nations (UN) during the Korean War (1950–53). Hoping that UN forces
would continue to fight and eventually unite North and South Korea under one
government, Rhee hindered the truce talks by ordering the release in June 1953 of some
25,000 anticommunist North Korean prisoners. (Under the agreed-upon truce settlement,
these men were to have been repatriated to North Korea.) Stunned, the communists broke
off the negotiations and renewed their attack, largely ignoring the UN forces and
concentrating their fire on Rhee’s South Korean troops. Having made their point, the
communists then resumed negotiations, and a truce settlement was speedily signed.
In spite of his authoritarian policies, Rhee failed to prevent the election of an opposition
vice president, Chang Myŏn, in 1956. Government claims that the March 1960 elections
gave Rhee more than 90 percent of the popular vote (55 percent in 1956) provoked student-
led demonstrations against election fraud, resulting in heavy casualties and demands for
Rhee’s resignation. These demands were supported by the unanimous vote of the National
Assembly and by the U.S. government. Rhee resigned on April 27, 1960, and went into
exile in Hawaii.

Sándor Petőfi
Sándor Petőfi, Hungarian form Petőfi Sándor, (born January 1, 1823, Kiskőrös, Hungary,
Austrian Empire—died probably July 31, 1849, Segesvár, Transylvania, Austrian Empire
[now Sighișoara, Romania]), one of the greatest Hungarian poets and a revolutionary who
symbolized the Hungarian desire for freedom.
Petőfi had an eventful youth; he studied at eight different schools, joined for a short time a
group of strolling players, and enlisted as a private soldier, but because of ill health he was
soon dismissed from the army. He traveled extensively in Hungary, mostly on foot. As a
schoolboy, he displayed a keen interest in the stage and in literature, and his first poem was
published in 1842. After years of vicissitudes, in 1844, on the recommendation of Mihály
Vörösmarty, then the leading Hungarian poet, he became an assistant editor of the literary
periodical Pesti Divatlap. His first volume of poetry, Versek, appeared in the same year and
made him famous at once, though the tone of his poems scandalized many. In 1847 he
married Julia Szendrey, who inspired his best love poems.
Petőfi played a leading role in the literary life of the period preceding the outbreak of the
Hungarian Revolution of 1848. After 1847, together with Mór Jókai, he edited the
magazine Életképek. A fervent partisan of the French Revolution, he castigated the social
conditions of his country, attacking the privileges of the nobles and the monarchy.
Politically, he was an extreme radical and an inspired agitator, but he was lacking in
experience and failed to obtain a seat in the Diet. His poems glowed with political passion,
and one of them, “Talpra magyar” (“Rise, Hungarian”), written on the eve of the
revolution, became its anthem. During the revolution he became the aide-de-camp of Gen.
Jozef Bem, then head of the Transylvanian army, who had great affection for the somewhat
unsoldierly but enthusiastic poet. Petőfi disappeared during the Battle of Segesvár, July 31,
1849, and was assumed to have died in the fighting, though his body was never discovered.
(Later claims that Petőfi had been taken prisoner and sent to Siberia were discredited.)
Petőfi’s poetry is characterized by realism, humour,
and descriptive power and imbued with a peculiar
vigour. He introduced a direct, unpretentious style
and a clear, unornamented construction adapted from
national folk songs. This simplicity was the more
arresting as it was used to reveal subtle emotions and
political or philosophical ideas. Of his epic poems the

Politically, he was an extreme radical and an inspired agitator, but he was lacking in experience and failed to obtain a seat in the Diet. His poems glowed with political passion, and one of them, “Talpra magyar” (“Rise, Hungarian”), written on the eve of the revolution, became its anthem. During the revolution he became the aide-de-camp of Gen. Jozef Bem, then head of the Transylvanian army, who had great affection for the somewhat unsoldierly but enthusiastic poet. Petőfi disappeared during the Battle of Segesvár, July 31, 1849, and was assumed to have died in the fighting, though his body was never discovered. (Later claims that Petőfi had been taken prisoner and sent to Siberia were discredited.) Petőfi’s poetry is characterized by realism, humour, and descriptive power and imbued with a peculiar vigour. He introduced a direct, unpretentious style and a clear, unornamented construction adapted from national folk songs. This simplicity was the more arresting as it was used to reveal subtle emotions and political or philosophical ideas. Of his epic poems the  Sándor Petőfi   János vitéz (1845), an entrancing fairy tale, is the most popular. Petőfi’s popularity has never diminished in Hungary.

Tara Singh
Tara Singh, also called Master Tara Singh, (born June 24, 1885, Haryal, near
Rawalpindi, India [now in Pakistan]—died November 22, 1967, Chandigarh), Sikh leader
known chiefly for his advocacy of an autonomous Punjabi-speaking Sikh nation in the
Punjab region. He was a champion of Sikh rights against the dominant Hindus, Muslims,
and British.
Tara Singh was born a Hindu, but while a student in Rawalpindi he became attracted to
Sikhism and underwent the required initiation ceremony. Upon graduation from Khalsa
College at Amritsar in 1907, he entered the Sikh school system in Lyallpur, becoming a
high school teacher, or “master,” a title associated with him thereafter.
A devout worker for the cause of Sikh religious and political integrity, Tara Singh often
found himself in opposition to civil authority. He was jailed for civil disobedience 14 times
between 1930 and 1966. In 1930 he became deeply involved with the civil disobedience
(satyagraha) movement of Mohandas K. Gandhi and was a leader of the Shiromani Akali
Dal (SAD; Supreme Akali Party), the principal Sikh political organization, and of the
Shiromani Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee (Supreme Committee of Temple
Management), which oversees the gurdwaras (Sikh houses of worship). He was best
known as an agitator for a Punjabi-speaking state as a means of keeping Sikh religious and
political traditions intact.
In 1961 Tara Singh declared that he would fast until the Indian prime minister, Jawaharlal
Nehru, ceded a portion of the Punjab as a Sikh state or until death claimed him. He began
his fast in August at the Harmandir Sahib (Golden Temple) at Amritsar, but Nehru
responded that submission to Tara Singh’s demands would be against India’s secular
constitution and unfair to the Hindus in Punjab. After a personal letter from Nehru
promising to investigate Sikh claims, Tara Singh broke his 48-day fast, incurring the wrath
of the Sikh people. Tara Singh was brought to trial before a council of pijaras (Sikh
religious leaders) and pleaded guilty. His failure to starve to death in defense of his ideals
had discredited him as a leader of the SAD, and Sant Fateh Singh was elected in his place.
Tara Singh’s dream of a Punjabi-speaking state was realized in 1966, when the Indian state
of Punjab was divided and the Hindi-speaking portion of it was created as the separate state
of Haryana.

Thakin Than Tun
Thakin Than Tun, (born 1911, Kanyutkwin, Burma (Myanmar)—died Sept. 24, 1968,
Bago Mountains), Burmese politician, leader of the Communist Party of Burma from 1945
until his death.
Than Tun was educated at Rangoon (Yangon) Teachers’ Training School and taught at a
high school in Rangoon. Influenced at an early age by Marxist writings, in 1936 he joined
the nationalist Dobama Asiayone (“We-Burmans Association or “Our Burma Association”).
Than Tun helped form the alliance between Ba Maw’s Sinyetha (“Proletarian”) Party and
the Dobama Asiayone, which resulted in the “freedom bloc” of 1940. That same year he
was imprisoned by the British for sedition. When Ba Maw’s pro-Japanese government was
established in 1942, Than Tun served as minister of land and agriculture. In 1943, however,
he became a leader of the underground resistance movement. After World War II he was
general secretary of the Anti-Fascist People’s Freedom League (AFPFL).
When Thakin Soe’s Red Flag Communist Party left the Burma Communist Party in early
1946, Than Tun and the majority of communists continued to cooperate with the AFPFL. In
the face of increasing disagreements with the AFPFL, however, he was forced to revolt in
March 1948, establishing his White Flag Party. He organized guerrilla forces in central
Burma, but the government was largely successful in containing his insurgents.
In 1964 the Burmese communist movement was split by the Sino-Soviet rift. Than Tun
took the side of Beijing, accusing Thakin Soe’s Red Flag Party of being Trotskyite, and he
sent a number of party members to China to be trained by Chinese revolutionaries. In 1967
he carried out his own cultural revolution, purging the White Flag Party of “revisionists.”
The next year Than Tun was assassinated in the Bago (Pegu) Mountains by one of his
subordinates.

Theódoros Kolokotrónis
Theódoros Kolokotrónis, (born April 1770, Messenia [Greece]—died Feb. 15, 1843,
Athens), prominent Greek patriot in the War of Greek Independence (1821–30).
As a member of the Greek revolutionary society Philikí Etaireía, Kolokotrónis led Moreot
bands during the War of Independence. His most brilliant action was his part in the defeat
of Mahmud Dramali’s Ottoman army in August 1822. He was imprisoned on Hydra for his
defiance of the central government but was later released to help defend the Morea
(Peloponnese) against the Egyptians. In 1825 he signed the Greek demand for British
protection and invited Sir Richard Church to be Greek commander in chief. In 1828 he
supported the president, Count I.A. Kapodístrias, and became one of the leaders of the pro-
Russian party. After the count’s assassination on Oct. 9, 1831, Kolokotrónis set up a rival
administration favouring 17-year-old Prince Otto of Bavaria for the newly created Greek
throne, and he later tried to overthrow the young king’s regency, composed largely of
Bavarians. For this, Kolokotrónis was condemned to death on June 7, 1834, but was later
reprieved.

Thomas Addis Emmet, (born April 24, 1764, Cork, County Cork, Ire.—died Nov. 14,
1827, New York City), lawyer in Ireland and, later, in the United States, a leader of the
nationalist Society of United Irishmen, and elder brother of the Irish revolutionary Robert
Emmet.
After studying medicine and law he was called in 1790 to the Irish bar, where he defended
the patriot leader James Napper Tandy and other anti-British political prisoners. In 1795 he
boldly took the United Irishmen’s oath in open court, was elected secretary of the Society
in the same year, and in 1797 became a director.
Before Lord Edward Fitzgerald’s abortive revolt of 1798 he had tried to induce the rebels
to wait for French military aid. Arrested with others on March 12, 1798, he was imprisoned
until 1802, when he was exiled to Brussels and later moved to Paris. There he sought
Napoleon I’s support for an Irish battalion to fight Great Britain, and it was there that he
heard of his brother Robert’s execution.
In 1804 he went to the U.S., where he soon became a highly successful lawyer. Before the
U.S. Supreme Court he eloquently but unsuccessfully argued the major constitutional case
of Gibbons v. Ogden (1824), in which the court, in accepting the arguments of Daniel
Webster and William Wirt based on the federal commerce power, struck down state
impediments to interstate commerce.

Waterford, County Waterford, Ire.—died July 1, 1867, near
Fort Benton, Mont., U.S.), Irish revolutionary leader and
orator who served as a Union officer during the American
Civil War (1861–65).
Meagher became a member of the Young Ireland Party in 1845 and in 1847 was one of the
founders of the Irish Confederation, dedicated to Irish independence. In 1848 he was
involved, with William Smith O’Brien, in an abortive attempt to mount an insurrection
against English rule. Arrested for high treason, he was condemned to death, but his
sentence was commuted to life imprisonment in Van Diemen’s Land (now Tasmania).
He escaped in 1852 and made his way to the United States. After a speaking tour of U.S.
cities, he settled in New York City, studied law, and was admitted to the bar in 1855. He
soon became a leader of the Irish in New York and, from 1856, edited the Irish News.
At the outbreak of the Civil War, Meagher became a captain of New York volunteers and
fought at the First Battle of Bull Run (July 1861). He then organized the Irish Brigade, and
in February 1862 was elevated to the rank of brigadier general. After his brigade was
decimated at the Battle of Chancellorsville (May 1863), Meagher resigned his commission,
but in December he returned to command the military district of Etowah, with headquarters
at Chattanooga, Tenn.
At the close of the war, he was appointed secretary of Montana Territory, where in the
absence of a territorial governor he served as acting governor until his accidental death by
drowning in the Missouri River.

Jefferson Memorial
Thomas Jefferson
Thomas Jefferson, (born April 2 [April 13, New
Style], 1743, Shadwell, Virginia [U.S.]—died July 4,
1826, Monticello, Virginia, U.S.), draftsman of the
Declaration of Independence of the United States and
the nation’s first secretary of state (1789–94) and
second vice president (1797–1801) and, as the third
president (1801–09), the statesman responsible for the
Louisiana Purchase. An early advocate of total
separation of church and state, he also was the
founder and architect of the University of Virginia
and the most eloquent American proponent of
individual freedom as the core meaning of the
American Revolution.
Long regarded as America’s most distinguished
“apostle of liberty,” Jefferson has come under
increasingly critical scrutiny within the scholarly
world. At the popular level, both in the United States
and abroad, he remains an incandescent icon, an
inspirational symbol for both major U.S. political
parties, as well as for dissenters in communist China,
liberal reformers in central and eastern Europe, and aspiring democrats in Africa and Latin
America. His image within scholarly circles has suffered, however, as the focus on racial
equality has prompted a more negative reappraisal of his dependence upon slavery and his
conviction that American society remain a white man’s domain. The huge gap between his
lyrical expression of liberal ideals and the more attenuated reality of his own life has
transformed Jefferson into America’s most problematic and paradoxical hero. The Jefferson
Memorial in Washington, D.C., was dedicated to him on April 13, 1943, the 200th
anniversary of his birth.
Early years
Albermarle county, where Jefferson was born, lay in the foothills of the Blue Ridge
Mountains in what was then regarded as a western province of the Old Dominion. His
father, Peter Jefferson, was a self-educated surveyor who amassed a tidy estate that

Monticello
included 60 slaves. According to family lore, Jefferson’s earliest memory was as a three-
year-old boy “being carried on a pillow by a mounted slave” when the family moved from
Shadwell to Tuckahoe. His mother, Jane Randolph Jefferson, was descended from one of
the most prominent families in Virginia. She raised two sons, of whom Jefferson was the
eldest, and six daughters. There is reason to believe that Jefferson’s relationship with his
mother was strained, especially after his father died in 1757, because he did everything he
could to escape her supervision and had almost nothing to say about her in his memoirs. He
boarded with the local schoolmaster to learn his Latin and Greek until 1760, when he
entered the College of William & Mary in Williamsburg.
By all accounts he was an obsessive student, often spending 15 hours of the day with his
books, 3 hours practicing his violin, and the remaining 6 hours eating and sleeping. The
two chief influences on his learning were William Small, a Scottish-born teacher of
mathematics and science, and George Wythe, the leading legal scholar in Virginia. From
them Jefferson learned a keen appreciation of supportive mentors, a concept he later
institutionalized at the University of Virginia. He read law with Wythe from 1762 to 1767,
then left Williamsburg to practice, mostly representing small-scale planters from the
western counties in cases involving land claims and titles. Although he handled no
landmark cases and came across as a nervous and somewhat indifferent speaker before the
bench, he earned a reputation as a formidable legal scholar. He was a shy and extremely
serious young man.
In 1768 he made two important decisions: first, to
build his own home atop an 867-foot- (264-metre-)
high mountain near Shadwell that he eventually
named Monticello and, second, to stand as a
candidate for the House of Burgesses. These
decisions nicely embodied the two competing
impulses that would persist throughout his life—
namely, to combine an active career in politics with periodic seclusion in his own private
haven. His political timing was also impeccable, for he entered the Virginia legislature just
as opposition to the taxation policies of the British Parliament was congealing. Although he
made few speeches and tended to follow the lead of the Tidewater elite, his support for
resolutions opposing Parliament’s authority over the colonies was resolute.
In the early 1770s his own character was also congealing. In 1772 he married Martha
Wayles Skelton (Martha Jefferson), an attractive and delicate young widow whose dowry

Independence
more than doubled his holdings in land and slaves. In 1774 he wrote A Summary View of
the Rights of British America, which was quickly published, though without his permission,
and catapulted him into visibility beyond Virginia as an early advocate of American
independence from Parliament’s authority; the American colonies were tied to Great
Britain, he believed, only by wholly voluntary bonds of loyalty to the king.
His reputation thus enhanced, the Virginia legislature appointed him a delegate to the
Second Continental Congress in the spring of 1775. He rode into Philadelphia—and into
American history—on June 20, 1775, a tall (slightly above 6 feet 2 inches [1.88 metres])
and gangly young man with reddish blond hair, hazel eyes, a burnished complexion, and
rock-ribbed certainty about the American cause. In retrospect, the central paradox of his
life was also on display, for the man who the following year was to craft the most famous
manifesto for human equality in world history arrived in an ornate carriage drawn by four
handsome horses and accompanied by three slaves.
Declaring independence
Jefferson’s inveterate shyness prevented him from
playing a significant role in the debates within the
Congress. John Adams, a leader in those debates,
remembered that Jefferson was silent even in
committee meetings, though consistently staunch in
his support for independence. His chief role was as a
draftsman of resolutions. In that capacity, on June 11, 1776, he was appointed to a five-
person committee, which also included Adams and Benjamin Franklin, to draft a formal
statement of the reasons why a break with Great Britain was justified. Adams asked him to
prepare the first draft, which he did within a few days. He later claimed that he was not
striving for “originality of principle or sentiment,” only seeking to provide “an expression
of the American mind”; that is, putting into words those ideas already accepted by a
majority of Americans. This accurately describes the longest section of the Declaration of
Independence, which lists the grievances against George III. It does not, however, describe
the following 55 words, which are generally regarded as the seminal statement of American
political culture:
We hold these truths to be self-evident; that all men are created equal; that they are endowed by
their Creator with certain inalienable rights; that among these are life, liberty and the pursuit of
happiness; that to secure these rights, governments are instituted among men, deriving their just
powers from the consent of the governed.

Declaration of Independence
On July 3–4 the Congress debated and edited
Jefferson’s draft, deleting and revising fully one-fifth
of the text. But they made no changes whatsoever in
this passage, which over succeeding generations
became the lyrical sanction for every liberal
movement in American history. At the time, Jefferson
himself was disconsolate that the Congress had seen
fit to make any changes in his language. Nevertheless, he was not regarded by his
contemporaries as the author of the Declaration, which was seen as a collective effort by
the entire Congress. Indeed, he was not known by most Americans as the principal author
until the 1790s. (See primary source document: Declaration of Independence.)
He returned to Virginia in October 1776 and immediately launched an extensive project for
the reform of the state’s legal code to bring it in line with the principles of the American
Revolution. Three areas of reform suggest the arc of his political vision: first, he sought and
secured abolition of primogeniture, entail, and all those remnants of feudalism that
discouraged a broad distribution of property; second, he proposed a comprehensive plan of
educational reform designed to assure access at the lowest level for all citizens and state
support at the higher levels for the most talented; third, he advocated a law prohibiting any
religious establishment and requiring complete separation of church and state. The last two
proposals were bitterly contested, especially the statute for religious freedom, which was
not enacted until 1786. (See primary source documents: An American Education for
American Youth, The Education of Women, and The Sphere of Religion.)
Taken together, these legal reforms capture the essence of Jefferson’s political philosophy,
which was less a comprehensive body of thought than a visionary prescription. He regarded
the past as a “dead hand” of encrusted privileges and impediments that must be cast off to
permit the natural energies of individual citizens to flow freely. The American Revolution,
as he saw it, was the first shot in what would eventually became a global battle for human
liberation from despotic institutions and all coercive versions of government.
At the end of what was probably the most creative phase of his public career, personal
misfortune struck in two successive episodes. Elected governor of Virginia in 1779, he was
caught off-guard by a surprise British invasion in 1780 against which the state was
defenseless. His flight from approaching British troops was described in the local press,
somewhat unfairly, as a cowardly act of abdication. (Critics would recall this awkward
moment throughout the remainder of his long career.) Then, in September 1782, his wife

died after a difficult delivery in May of their third daughter. These two disasters caused him
to vow that he would never again desert his family for his country.
American in Paris
The vow was sincere but short-lived. Jefferson agreed, albeit reluctantly, to serve as a
delegate to the Continental Congress in December 1782, where his major contribution was
to set forth the principle that territories in the West should not be treated as colonies but
rather should enter the Union with status equal to the original states once certain conditions
were met. Then, in 1784, recognizing the need to escape the memories of Martha that
haunted the hallways at Monticello, he agreed to replace Franklin as American minister to
France; or, as legend tells the story, he agreed to succeed Franklin, noting that no one could
replace him.
During his five-year sojourn in Paris, Jefferson accomplished very little in any official
sense. Several intractable conditions rendered his best diplomatic efforts futile: the United
States was heavily in debt owing to the recent war, so few European nations were
interested in signing treaties of amity and commerce with the infant American republic; the
federal government created under the Articles of Confederation was notoriously weak, so
clear foreign policy directives proved impossible; Great Britain already enjoyed a
monopoly, controlling more than 80 percent of America’s foreign trade, so it had no
incentive to negotiate commercial treaties on less favourable terms; and France was drifting
toward a cataclysmic political crisis of its own, so relations with the upstart new nation
across the Atlantic were hardly a high priority.
As a result, Jefferson’s diplomatic overtures to establish a market for American tobacco and
to reopen French ports to whale oil produced meagre results, his efforts to create an
alliance of American and European powers to contest the terrorism of the Barbary pirates
proved stillborn, and his vision of open markets for all nations, a world without tariffs,
seemed excessively visionary. His only significant achievement was the negotiation of a
$400,000 loan from Dutch bankers that allowed the American government to consolidate
its European debts, but even that piece of diplomacy was conducted primarily by John
Adams, then serving as American minister to the Court of St. James’s in London.
But the Paris years were important to Jefferson for personal reasons and are important to
biographers and historians for the new light they shed on his famously elusive personality.
The dominant pattern would seem to be the capacity to live comfortably with contradiction.
For example, he immersed himself wholeheartedly in the art, architecture, wine, and food

of Parisian society but warned all prospective
American tourists to remain in America so as to avoid
the avarice, luxury, and sheer sinfulness of European
fleshpots. He made a point of bringing along his elder
daughter, Martha (called Patsy as a girl), and later
sent for his younger daughter, Maria (called Polly),
all as part of his genuine devotion as a single parent.
But he then placed both daughters in a convent, wrote
them stern lecturelike letters about proper female etiquette, and enforced a patriarchal
distance that was in practice completely at odds with his theoretical commitment to
intimacy.
With women in general his letters convey a message of conspicuous gallantry, playfully
flirtatious in the manner of a male coquette. The most self-revealing letter he ever wrote, “a
dialogue between the head and the heart,” was sent to Maria Cosway, an Anglo-Italian
beauty who left him utterly infatuated. Jefferson and Cosway, who was married to a
prominent if somewhat degenerate English miniaturist, spent several months in a romantic
haze, touring Parisian gardens, museums, and art shows together, but whether Jefferson’s
head or heart prevailed, either in the letter or in life, is impossible to know. Meanwhile,
there is considerable evidence to suggest, but not to prove conclusively, that Jefferson
initiated a sexual liaison with his attractive young mulatto slave Sally Hemings in 1788,
about the time his torrid affair with Cosway cooled down—this despite his public
statements denouncing blacks as biologically inferior and sexual relations between the
races as taboo. (See Sidebar: “Tom and Sally”: the Jefferson-Hemings paternity debate.)
During the latter stages of Jefferson’s stay in Paris, Louis XVI, the French king, was forced
to convene the Assembly of Notables in Versailles to deal with France’s deep financial
crisis. Jefferson initially regarded the assembly as a French version of the Constitutional
Convention, then meeting in Philadelphia. Much influenced by moderate leaders such as
the Marquis de Lafayette, he expected the French Revolution to remain a bloodless affair
that would culminate in a revised French government, probably a constitutional monarchy
along English lines. He remained oblivious to the resentments and volatile energies pent up
within French society that were about to explode in the Reign of Terror, mostly because he
thought the French Revolution would follow the American model. He was fortunate to
depart France late in 1789, just at the onset of mob violence.
Slavery and racism
1/14/23, 3:49 PM

https://www.britannica.com/print/article/302264
7/18
Jefferson, Thomas
Even before his departure from France, Jefferson had
overseen the publication of Notes on the State of
Virginia. This book, the only one Jefferson ever
published, was part travel guide, part scientific
treatise, and part philosophical meditation. Jefferson
had written it in the fall of 1781 and had agreed to a
French edition only after learning that an
unauthorized version was already in press. Notes contained an extensive discussion of
slavery, including a graphic description of its horrific effects on both blacks and whites, a
strong assertion that it violated the principles on which the American Revolution was
based, and an apocalyptic prediction that failure to end slavery would lead to “convulsions
which will probably never end but in the extermination of one or the other race.” It also
contained the most explicit assessment that Jefferson ever wrote of what he believed were
the biological differences between blacks and whites, an assessment that exposed the deep-
rooted racism that he, like most Americans and almost all Virginians of his day, harboured
throughout his life.
To his critics in later generations, Jefferson’s views on race seemed particularly virulent
because of his purported relationship with Sally Hemings, who bore several children
obviously fathered by a white man and some of whom had features resembling those of
Jefferson. The public assertion of this relationship was originally made in 1802 by a
disreputable journalist interested in injuring Jefferson’s political career. His claim was
corroborated, however, by one of Hemings’s children in an 1873 newspaper interview and
then again in a 1968 book by Winthrop Jordan revealing that Hemings became pregnant
only when Jefferson was present at Monticello. Finally, in 1998, DNA samples were
gathered from living descendants of Jefferson and Hemings. Tests revealed that Jefferson
was almost certainly the father of some of Hemings’s children. What remained unclear was
the character of the relationship—consensual or coercive, a matter of love or rape, or a
mutually satisfactory arrangement. Jefferson’s admirers preferred to consider it a love affair
and to see Jefferson and Hemings as America’s preeminent biracial couple. His critics, on
the other hand, considered Jefferson a sexual predator whose eloquent statements about
human freedom and equality were hypocritical.
In any case, coming as it did at the midpoint of Jefferson’s career, the publication of Notes
affords the opportunity to review Jefferson’s previous and subsequent positions on the most
volatile and therefore most forbidden topic in the revolutionary era (see primary source
document: On Accommodating African Americans). Early in his career Jefferson had taken
1/14/23, 3:49 PM

a leadership role in pushing slavery onto the political agenda in the Virginia assembly and
the federal Congress. In the 1760s and ’70s, like most Virginia planters, he endorsed the
end of the slave trade. (Virginia’s plantations were already well stocked with slaves, so
ending the slave trade posed no economic threat and even enhanced the value of the
existent slave population.) In his original draft of the Declaration of Independence, he
included a passage, subsequently deleted by the Continental Congress, blaming both the
slave trade and slavery itself on George III. Unlike most of his fellow Virginians, Jefferson
was prepared to acknowledge that slavery was an anomaly in the American republic
established in 1776. His two most practical proposals came in the early 1780s: a gradual
emancipation scheme by which all slaves born after 1800 would be freed and their owners
compensated, and a prohibition of slavery in all the territories of the West as a condition for
admission to the Union. By the time of the publication of Notes, then, Jefferson’s record on
slavery placed him among the most progressive elements of southern society. Rather than
ask how he could possibly tolerate the persistence of slavery, it is more historically correct
to wonder how this member of Virginia’s planter class had managed to develop such liberal
convictions.
Dating the onset of a long silence is inevitably an imprecise business, but by the time of his
return to the United States in 1789 Jefferson had backed away from a leadership position
on slavery. The ringing denunciations of slavery presented in Notes had generated
controversy, especially within the planter class of Virginia, and Jefferson’s deep aversion to
controversy made him withdraw from the cutting edge of the antislavery movement once
he experienced the sharp feelings it aroused. Moreover, the very logic of his argument in
Notes exposed the inherent intractability of his position. Although he believed that slavery
was a gross violation of the principles celebrated in the Declaration of Independence, he
also believed that people of African descent were biologically inferior to whites and could
never live alongside whites in peace and harmony. They would have to be transported
elsewhere, back to Africa or perhaps the Caribbean, after emancipation. Because such a
massive deportation was a logistical and economic impossibility, the unavoidable
conclusion was that, though slavery was wrong, ending it, at least at present, was
inconceivable. That became Jefferson’s public position throughout the remainder of his life.
It also shaped his personal posture as a slave owner. Jefferson owned, on average, about
200 slaves at any point in time, and slightly over 600 over his lifetime. To protect himself
from facing the reality of his problematic status as plantation master, he constructed a
paternalistic self-image as a benevolent father caring for what he called “my family.”
Believing that he and his slaves were the victims of history’s failure to proceed along the

enlightened path, he saw himself as the steward for those entrusted to his care until a better
future arrived for them all. In the meantime, his own lavish lifestyle and all the incessant
and expensive renovations of his Monticello mansion were wholly dependent on slave
labour. Whatever silent thoughts he might have harboured about freeing his slaves never
found their way into the record. (He freed only five slaves, all members of the Hemings
family.) His mounting indebtedness rendered all such thoughts superfluous toward the end,
because his slaves, like all his possessions, were mortgaged to his creditors and therefore
not really his to free.
Party politics
Jefferson returned to the United States in 1789 to
serve as the first secretary of state under President
George Washington. He was entering the most
uncharted waters in American history. There had
never been an enduring republican government in a
nation as large as the United States, and no one was
sure if it was possible or how it would work. The
Constitution ratified in 1788 was still a work-in-
progress, less a blueprint that provided answers than a framework for arguing about the
salient questions. And because Jefferson had been serving in France when the constitutional
battles of 1787–88 were waged in Philadelphia and then in the state ratifying conventions,
he entered the volatile debates of the 1790s without a clear track record of his
constitutional convictions. In truth, unlike his friend and disciple James Madison, Jefferson
did not think primarily in constitutional categories. His major concern about the new
Constitution was the absence of any bill of rights. He was less interested in defining the
powers of government than in identifying those regions where government could not
intrude (see primary source documents: On the New Constitution and On the Omission of a
Bill of Rights).
During his tenure as secretary of state (1790–93), foreign policy was his chief
responsibility. Within the cabinet a three-pronged division soon emerged over American
policy toward the European powers. While all parties embraced some version of the
neutrality doctrine, the specific choices posed by the ongoing competition for supremacy in
Europe between England and France produced a bitter conflict. Washington and Adams,
who was serving as vice president, insisted on complete neutrality, which in practice meant
tacking back and forth between the two dominant world powers of the moment. Alexander
Hamilton pushed for a pro-English version of neutrality—chiefly commercial ties with the
1/14/23, 3:49 PM

https://www.britannica.com/print/article/302264
10/18
most potent mercantile power in the world. Jefferson favoured a pro-French version of
neutrality, arguing that the Franco-American treaty of 1778 obliged the United States to
honour past French support during the war for independence, and that the French
Revolution embodied the “spirit of ’76” on European soil. Even when the French
Revolution spun out of control and began to devour its own partisans, Jefferson insisted
that these bloody convulsions were only temporary excesses justified by the larger
ideological issues at stake.
This remained his unwavering position throughout the decade. Even after he retired from
office late in 1793, he issued directives from Monticello opposing the Neutrality Act (1793)
and the Jay Treaty (1795) as pacts with the British harlot and betrayals of our French
brethren. Serving as vice president during the Adams presidency (1797–1801), Jefferson
worked behind the scenes to undermine Adams’s efforts to sustain strict neutrality and
blamed the outbreak of the “quasi-war” with France in 1797–98 on what he called “our
American Anglophiles” rather than the French Directory. His foreign-policy vision was
resolutely moralistic and highly ideological, dominated by a dichotomous view of England
as a corrupt and degenerate engine of despotism and France as the enlightened wave of the
future.
Jefferson’s position on domestic policy during the 1790s was a variation on the same
ideological dichotomy. As Hamilton began to construct his extensive financial program—to
include funding the national debt, assuming the state debts, and creating a national bank—
Jefferson came to regard the consolidation of power at the federal level as a diabolical plot
to subvert the true meaning of the American Revolution. As Jefferson saw it, the entire
Federalist commitment to an energetic central government with broad powers over the
domestic economy replicated the arbitrary policies of Parliament and George III, which the
American Revolution had supposedly repudiated as monarchical and aristocratic practices,
incompatible with the principles of republicanism. Jefferson sincerely believed that the
“principles of ’76” were being betrayed by a Federalist version of the “court party,” whose
covert scheme was to install monarchy and a pseudo-aristocracy of bankers and
“monocrats” to rule over the American yeomanry.
All the major events of the decade—the creation of a national bank, the debate over the
location of a national capital, the suppression of the Whiskey Rebellion in western
Pennsylvania, the passage of the Jay Treaty, and, most notoriously, the enforcement of the
Alien and Sedition Acts—were viewed through this ideological lens. By the middle years
of the decade two distinctive political camps had emerged, calling themselves Federalists
1/14/23, 3:49 PM

and Republicans (later Democratic-Republicans). Not that modern-day political parties,
with their mechanisms for raising money, selecting candidates, and waging election
campaigns, were fully formed at this stage. (Full-blooded political parties date from the
1830s and ’40s.) But an embryonic version of the party structure was congealing, and
Jefferson, assisted and advised by Madison, established the rudiments of the first
opposition party in American politics under the Republican banner.
The partnership between Jefferson and Madison, labeled by subsequent historians as “the
great collaboration,” deserves special attention. John Quincy Adams put it nicely when he
observed that “the mutual influence of these two mighty minds on each other is a
phenomenon, like the invisible and mysterious movements of the magnet in the physical
world.” Because the notion of a legitimate opposition to the elected government did not yet
exist, and because the term party remained an epithet that was synonymous with faction,
meaning an organized effort to undermine the public interest, Jefferson and Madison were
labeled as traitors by the Federalist press. They were, in effect, inventing a modern form of
political behaviour before there was any neutral vocabulary for talking about it. Jefferson’s
own capacity to live comfortably with contradictions served him well in this context, since
he was creating and leading a political party while insisting that parties were evil agents. In
1796 he ran for the presidency against Adams, all the while claiming not to know that he
was even a candidate. Most negative assessments of Jefferson’s character date from this
period, especially the charge of hypocrisy and duplicity.
The highly combustible political culture of the early republic reached a crescendo in the
election of 1800, one of the most fiercely contested campaigns in American history. (See
primary source document: Jefferson and Liberty.) The Federalist press described Jefferson
as a pagan and atheist, a treasonable conspirator against the duly elected administrations of
Washington and Adams, a utopian dreamer with anarchistic tendencies toward the role of
government, and a cunning behind-the-scenes manipulator of Republican propaganda. All
these charges were gross exaggerations, save the last. Always operating through
intermediaries, Jefferson paid several journalists to libel Adams, his old friend but current
political enemy, and offered the vice presidency to Aaron Burr in return for delivering the
electoral votes of New York. In the final tally the 12 New York votes made the difference,
with the tandem of Jefferson and Burr winning 73 to 65. A quirk in the Constitution,
subsequently corrected in the Twelfth Amendment, prevented electors from distinguishing
between their choice of president and vice president, so Jefferson and Burr tied for the top
spot, even though voter preference for Jefferson was incontestable. The decision was

thrown into the House of Representatives where, after several weeks of debate and
backroom wheeling and dealing, Jefferson was elected on the 36th ballot.
Presidency
There was a good deal of nervous speculation whether the new American nation could
survive a Jefferson presidency. The entire thrust of Jefferson’s political position throughout
the 1790s had been defiantly negative, rejecting as excessive the powers vested in the
national government by the Federalists. In his Virginia Resolutions of 1798, written in
protest of the Alien and Sedition Acts, he had described any projection of federal authority
over the domestic policy of the states as a violation of “the spirit of ’76” and therefore a
justification for secession from the Union. (This became the position of the Confederacy in
1861.) His Federalist critics wondered how he could take an oath to preserve, protect, and
defend the Constitution of the United States if his primary goal as president was to
dismantle the federal institutions created by that very document. As he rose to deliver his
inaugural address on March 4, 1801, in the still-unfinished Capitol of the equally
unfinished national capital on the Potomac, the mood was apprehensive. The most rabid
alarmists had already been proved wrong, since the first transfer of power from one
political regime to another had occurred peacefully, even routinely. But it was still very
much an open question whether, as Lincoln later put it, “any nation so conceived and so
dedicated could long endure” in the absence of a central government along Federalist lines.
The major message of Jefferson’s inaugural address was conciliatory. Its most famous line
(“We are all republicans—we are all federalists”) suggested that the scatological party
battles of the previous decade must cease. He described his election as a recovery of the
original intentions of the American Revolution, this after the hostile takeover of those
“ancient and sacred truths” by the Federalists, who had erroneously assumed that a stable
American nation required a powerful central government. In Jefferson’s truly distinctive
and original formulation, the coherence of the American republic did not require the
mechanisms of a powerful state to survive or flourish. Indeed, the health of the emerging
American nation was inversely proportional to the power of the federal government, for in
the end the sovereign source of republican government was voluntary popular opinion, “the
people,” and the latent energies these liberated individuals released when unburdened by
government restrictions.
In 1804 Jefferson was easily reelected over Federalist Charles Cotesworth Pinckney,
winning 162 electoral votes to Pinckney’s 14. Initially, at least, his policies as president
reflected his desire for decentralization, which meant dismantling the embryonic federal

government, the army and navy, and all federal taxation programs, as well as placing the
national debt, which stood at $112 million, on the road to extinction. These reforms
enjoyed considerable success for two reasons. First, the temporary cessation of the war
between England and France for European supremacy permitted American merchants to
trade with both sides and produced unprecedented national prosperity. Second, in selecting
Albert Gallatin as secretary of the Treasury, Jefferson placed one of the most capable
managers of fiscal policy in the most strategic location. Gallatin, a Swiss-born prodigy with
impeccable Republican credentials, dominated the cabinet discussions alongside Madison,
the ever-loyal Jefferson disciple who served as secretary of state.
Actually there were very few cabinet discussions because Jefferson preferred to do the bulk
of business within the executive branch in writing. Crafting language on the page was his
most obvious talent, and he required all cabinet officers to submit drafts of their
recommendations, which he then edited and returned for their comments. The same textual
approach applied to his dealings with Congress. All of his annual messages were delivered
in writing rather than in person. Indeed, apart from his two inaugural addresses (see
primary source documents: First Inaugural Address and Second Inaugural Address), there is
no record of Jefferson delivering any public speeches whatsoever. In part this was a
function of his notoriously inadequate abilities as an orator, but it also reflected his desire
to make the office of the presidency almost invisible. His one gesture at visibility was to
schedule weekly dinners when Congress was in session, which became famous for the
quality of the wine, the pell-mell seating arrangements, and informal approach to etiquette
—a clear defiance of European-style decorum.
The major achievement of his first term was also an act of defiance, though this time it
involved defying his own principles. In 1803 Napoleon decided to consolidate his
resources for a new round of the conflict with England by selling the vast Louisiana region,
which stretched from the Mississippi Valley to the Rocky Mountains. Although the asking
price, $15 million, was a stupendous bargain, assuming the cost meant substantially
increasing the national debt. More significantly, what became known as the Louisiana
Purchase violated Jefferson’s constitutional scruples. Indeed, many historians regard it as
the boldest executive action in American history. But Jefferson never wavered, reasoning
that the opportunity to double the national domain was too good to miss. The American
West always triggered Jefferson’s most visionary energies, seeing it, as he did, as America’s
future, the place where the simple republican principles could be constantly renewed. In
one fell swoop he removed the threat of a major European power from America’s borders
and extended the life span of the uncluttered agrarian values he so cherished. Even before

news that the purchase was approved reached the United States in July 1803, Jefferson
dispatched his private secretary, Meriwether Lewis, to lead an expedition to explore the
new acquisition and the lands beyond, all the way to the Pacific.
If the Louisiana Purchase was the crowning achievement of Jefferson’s presidency, it also
proved to be the high point from which events moved steadily in the other direction.
Although the Federalist Party was dead as a national force, pockets of Federalist opposition
still survived, especially in New England. Despite his eloquent testimonials to the need for
a free press, Jefferson was outraged by the persistent attacks on his policies and character
from those quarters, and he instructed the attorneys general in the recalcitrant states to seek
indictments, in clear violation of his principled commitment to freedom of expression (see
primary source document: On Misreporting by the Press). He was equally heavy-handed in
his treatment of Aaron Burr, who was tried for treason after leading a mysterious
expedition into the American Southwest allegedly designed to detach that region from the
United States with Burr crowned as its benevolent dictator. The charges were never proved,
but Jefferson demanded Burr’s conviction despite the lack of evidence. He was overruled
in the end by Chief Justice John Marshall, who sat as the judge in the trial.
But Jefferson’s major disappointment had its origins in Europe with the resumption of the
Napoleonic Wars, which resulted in naval blockades in the Atlantic and Caribbean that
severely curtailed American trade and pressured the U.S. government to take sides in the
conflict. Jefferson’s response was the Embargo Act (1807), which essentially closed
American ports to all foreign imports and American exports. The embargo assumed that the
loss of American trade would force England and France to alter their policies, but this fond
hope was always an illusion, since the embryonic American economy lacked the size to
generate such influence and was itself wrecked by Jefferson’s action. Moreover, the
enforcement of the Embargo Act required the exercise of precisely those coercive powers
by the federal government that Jefferson had previously opposed. By the time he left office
in March 1809, Jefferson was a tired and beaten man, anxious to escape the consequences
of his futile efforts to preserve American neutrality and eager to embrace the two-term
precedent established by Washington.
Retirement
During the last 17 years of his life Jefferson maintained a crowded and active schedule. He
rose with the dawn each day, bathed his feet in cold water, then spent the morning on his
correspondence (one year he counted writing 1,268 letters) and working in his garden.
Each afternoon he took a two-hour ride around his grounds. Dinner, served in the late

afternoon, was usually an occasion to gather his
daughter Martha and her 12 children, along with the
inevitable visitors. Monticello became a veritable
hotel during these years, on occasion housing 50
guests. The lack of privacy caused Jefferson to build a
separate house on his Bedford estate about 90 miles
(140 km) from Monticello, where he periodically fled
for seclusion.
Three architectural projects claimed a considerable
share of his attention. Throughout his life Monticello
remained a work-in-progress that had the appearance
of a construction site. Even during his retirement
years, Jefferson’s intensive efforts at completing the
renovations never quite produced the masterpiece of
neoclassical design he wanted to achieve and that modern-day visitors to Monticello find
so compelling. A smaller but more architecturally distinctive mansion at Bedford, called
Poplar Forest, was completed on schedule. It too embodied neoclassical principles but was
shaped as a perfect octagon. Finally there was the campus of the University of Virginia at
Charlottesville, which Jefferson called his “academical village.” Jefferson surveyed the
site, which he could view in the distance from his mountaintop, and chose the Pantheon of
Rome as the model for the rotunda, the centrepiece flanked by two rows of living quarters
for students and faculty. In 1976 the American Institute of Architects voted it “the proudest
achievement of American architecture in the past 200 years.” Even the “interior” design of
the University of Virginia embodied Jeffersonian principles, in that he selected all the
books for the library, defined the curriculum, picked the faculty, and chaired the Board of
Visitors. Unlike every other American college at the time, “Mr. Jefferson’s university” had
no religious affiliation and imposed no religious requirement on its students. As befitted an
institution shaped by a believer in wholly voluntary and consensual networks of
governance, there were no curricular requirements, no mandatory code of conduct except
the self-enforced honour system, no president or administration. Every aspect of life at the
University of Virginia reflected Jefferson’s belief that the only legitimate form of
governance was self-governance.
In 1812 his vast correspondence began to include an exchange with his former friend and
more recent rival John Adams. The reconciliation between the two patriarchs was arranged
by their mutual friend Benjamin Rush, who described them as “the North and South poles

of the American Revolution.” That description suggested more than merely geographic
symbolism, since Adams and Jefferson effectively, even dramatically, embodied the twin
impulses of the revolutionary generation. As the “Sage of Monticello,” Jefferson
represented the Revolution as a clean break with the past, the rejection of all European
versions of political discipline as feudal vestiges, the ingrained hostility toward all
mechanisms of governmental authority that originated in faraway places. As the “Sage of
Quincy (Massachusetts),” Adams resembled an American version of Edmund Burke, which
meant that he attributed the success of the American Revolution to its linkage with past
practices, most especially the tradition of representative government established in the
colonial assemblies. He regarded the constitutional settlement of 1787–88 as a shrewd
compromise with the political necessities of a nation-state exercising jurisdiction over an
extensive, eventually continental, empire, not as a betrayal of the American Revolution but
an evolutionary fulfillment of its promise.
These genuine differences of opinion made Adams and Jefferson the odd couple of the
American Revolution and were the primary reasons why they had drifted to different sides
of the divide during the party wars of the 1790s. The exchange of 158 letters between 1812
and 1826 permitted the two sages to pose as philosopher-kings and create what is arguably
the most intellectually impressive correspondence between statesmen in all of American
history. Beyond the elegiac tone and almost sculpted serenity of the letters, the
correspondence exposed the fundamental contradictions that the American Revolution
managed to contain. As Adams so poignantly put it, “You and I ought not to die before we
have explained ourselves to each other.” And because of Adams’s incessant prodding,
Jefferson was frequently forced to clarify his mature position on the most salient issues of
the era.
One issue that even Adams and Jefferson could not discuss candidly was slavery.
Jefferson’s mature position on that forbidden subject represented a further retreat from any
leadership role in ending the “peculiar institution.” In 1819, during the debate in Congress
over the Missouri Compromise, he endorsed the expansion of slavery into all the western
territories, precisely the opposite of the position he had taken in the 1780s. Though he
continued to insist that slavery was a massive anomaly, he insisted even more strongly that
it was wrong for the federal government to attempt any effort at emancipation. In fact he
described any federal intrusion in the matter as a despotic act analogous to George III’s
imperial interference in colonial affairs or Hamilton’s corrupt scheme to establish a
disguised form of monarchy in the early republic. His letters to fellow Virginians during his

last years reflect a conspiratorial mentality toward the national government and a clear
preference for secession if threatened with any mandatory plan for abolition.
Apart from slavery, the other shadow that darkened Monticello during Jefferson’s twilight
years was debt. Jefferson was chronically in debt throughout most of his life, in part
because of obligations inherited from his father-in-law in his wife’s dowry, mostly because
of his own lavish lifestyle, which never came to terms with the proverbial bottom line
despite careful entries in his account books that provided him with only the illusion of
control. In truth, by the 1820s the interest on his debt was compounding at a faster rate than
any repayment schedule could meet. By the end, he was more than $100,000—in modern
terms several million dollars—in debt. An exception was made in Virginia law to permit a
lottery that Jefferson hoped would allow his heirs to retain at least a portion of his property.
But the massiveness of his debt overwhelmed all such hopes. Monticello, including land,
mansion, furnishings, and the vast bulk of the slave population, was auctioned off the year
after his death, and his surviving daughter, Martha, was forced to accept charitable
contributions to sustain her family.
Before that ignominious end, which Jefferson never lived to see, he managed to sound one
last triumphant note that projected his most enduring and attractive message to posterity. In
late June 1826 Jefferson was asked to join the Independence Day celebrations in
Washington, D.C., on the 50th anniversary of the defining event in his and the nation’s life.
He declined, explaining that he was in no condition to leave his mountaintop. But he
mustered up one final surge of energy to draft a statement that would be read in his absence
at the ceremony. He clearly intended it as his final testament. Though some of the
language, like the language of the Declaration itself, was borrowed from others, here was
the vintage Jeffersonian vision:
May it be to the world, what I believe it will be, (to some parts sooner, to others later, but finally
to all,) the signal of arousing men to burst the chains under which monkish ignorance and
superstition had persuaded them to bind themselves, and to assume the blessings and security of
self-government.… All eyes are opened or opening to the rights of men. The general spread of
the light of science has already laid open to every view the palpable truth, that the mass of
mankind has not been born with saddles on their backs, nor a favored few, booted and spurred,
ready to ride them legitimately by the grace of God. These are grounds of hope for others; for
ourselves, let the annual return of this day forever refresh our recollections of these rights, and
an undiminished devotion to them.
Even as these words were being read in Washington, Jefferson went to his maker in his bed
at Monticello at about half past noon on July 4, 1826. His last conscious words, uttered the

preceding evening, were “Is it the Fourth?” Always a man given to Herculean feats of self-
control, he somehow managed to time his own death to coincide with history. More
remarkably, up in Quincy on that same day his old rival and friend also managed to die on
schedule. John Adams passed away later in the afternoon. His last words—“Thomas
Jefferson still lives”—were wrong at the moment but right for the future, since Jefferson’s
complex legacy was destined to become the most resonant and controversial touchstone in
all of American history.

Louisiana Purchase.', 'An early advocate of total separation of church and state, Thomas Jefferson also was the founder and architect of the University of Virginia and the most eloquent American proponent of individual freedom as the core meaning of the American Revolution.', 'Long regarded as America’s most distinguished “apostle of liberty,” Jefferson has come under increasingly critical scrutiny within the scholarly world.', 'At the popular level, both in the United States and abroad, Thomas Jefferson remains an incandescent icon, an inspirational symbol for both major U.S. political parties, as well as for dissenters in communist China, liberal reformers in central and eastern Europe, and aspiring democrats in Africa and Latin America.', 'Thomas Jefferson image within scholarly circles has suffered, however, as the focus on racial equality has prompted a more negative reappraisal of Thomas Jefferson dependence upon slavery and Thomas Jefferson conviction that American society remain a white man’s domain.', 'The huge gap between Thomas Jefferson lyrical expression of liberal ideals and the more attenuated reality of Thomas Jefferson own life has transformed Jefferson into America’s most problematic and paradoxical hero.', 'The Jefferson Memorial in Washington, D.C., was dedicated to Thomas Jefferson on April 13, 1943, the 200th anniversary of Thomas Jefferson birth.', 'Early years Albermarle county, where Jefferson was born, lay in the foothills of the Blue Ridge Mountains in what was then regarded as a western province of the Old Dominion.', 'Thomas Jefferson father, Peter Jefferson, was a self-educated surveyor who amassed a tidy estate that  Thomas Jefferson   Monticello included 60 slaves.', 'According to family lore, Jefferson’s earliest memory was as a three- year-old boy “being carried on a pillow by a mounted slave” when the family moved from Shadwell to Tuckahoe.', 'Thomas Jefferson mother, Jane Randolph Jefferson, was descended from one of the most prominent families in Virginia.', 'Thomas Jefferson raised two sons, of whom Jefferson was the eldest, and six daughters.', 'There is reason to believe that Jefferson’s relationship with Thomas Jefferson mother was strained, especially after Thomas Jefferson father died in 1757, because Thomas Jefferson did everything Thomas Jefferson could to escape Thomas Jefferson supervision and had almost nothing to say about Thomas Jefferson in Thomas Jefferson memoirs.', 'Thomas Jefferson boarded with the local schoolmaster to learn Thomas Jefferson Latin and Greek until 1760, when Thomas Jefferson entered the College of William & Mary in Williamsburg.', 'By all accounts Thomas Jefferson was an obsessive student, often spending 15 hours of the day with Thomas Jefferson books, 3 hours practicing Thomas Jefferson violin, and the remaining 6 hours eating and sleeping.', 'The two chief influences on Thomas Jefferson learning were William Small, a Scottish-born teacher of mathematics and science, and George Wythe, the leading legal scholar in Virginia.', 'From them Jefferson learned a keen appreciation of supportive mentors, a concept Thomas Jefferson later institutionalized at the University of Virginia.', 'Thomas Jefferson read law with Wythe from 1762 to 1767, then left Williamsburg to practice, mostly representing small-scale planters from the western counties in cases involving land claims and titles.', 'Although Thomas Jefferson handled no landmark cases and came across as a nervous and somewhat indifferent speaker before the bench, Thomas Jefferson earned a reputation as a formidable legal scholar.', 'Thomas Jefferson was a shy and extremely serious young man.', 'In 1768 Thomas Jefferson made two important decisions: first, to build Thomas Jefferson own home atop an 867-foot- (264-metre-) high mountain near Shadwell that Thomas Jefferson eventually named Monticello and, second, to stand as a candidate for the House of Burgesses.', 'These decisions nicely embodied the two competing impulses that would persist throughout Thomas Jefferson life— namely, to combine an active career in politics with periodic seclusion in Thomas Jefferson own private haven.', 'Thomas Jefferson political timing was also impeccable, for Thomas Jefferson entered the Virginia legislature just as opposition to the taxation policies of the British Parliament was congealing.', 'Although Thomas Jefferson made few speeches and tended to follow the lead of the Tidewater elite, Thomas Jefferson support for resolutions opposing Parliament’s authority over the colonies was resolute.', 'In the early 1770s Thomas Jefferson own character was also congealing.', 'In 1772 Thomas Jefferson married Martha Wayles Skelton (Martha Jefferson), an attractive and delicate young widow whose dowry  Thomas Jefferson   Trumbull, John: Declaration of Independence more than doubled Thomas Jefferson holdings in land and slaves.', 'In 1774 Thomas Jefferson wrote A Summary View of the Rights of British America, which was quickly published, though without Thomas Jefferson permission, and catapulted Thomas Jefferson into visibility beyond Virginia as an early advocate of American independence from Parliament’s authority; the American colonies were tied to Great Britain, Thomas Jefferson believed, only by wholly voluntary bonds of loyalty to the king.', 'Thomas Jefferson reputation thus enhanced, the Virginia legislature appointed Thomas Jefferson a delegate to the Second Continental Congress in the spring of 1775.', 'Thomas Jefferson rode into Philadelphia—and into American history—on June 20, 1775, a tall (slightly above 6 feet 2 inches [1.88 metres]) and gangly young man with reddish blond hair, hazel eyes, a burnished complexion, and rock-ribbed certainty about the American cause.', 'In retrospect, the central paradox of Thomas Jefferson life was also on display, for the man who the following year was to craft the most famous manifesto for human equality in world history arrived in an ornate carriage drawn by four handsome horses and accompanied by three slaves.', 'Declaring independence Jefferson’s inveterate shyness prevented Thomas Jefferson from playing a significant role in the debates within the Congress.', 'John Adams, a leader in those debates, remembered that Jefferson was silent even in committee meetings, though consistently staunch in Thomas Jefferson support for independence.', 'Thomas Jefferson chief role was as a draftsman of resolutions.', 'In that capacity, on June 11, 1776, Thomas Jefferson was appointed to a five- person committee, which also included Adams and Benjamin Franklin, to draft a formal statement of the reasons why a break with Great Britain was justified.', 'Adams asked Thomas Jefferson to prepare the first draft, which Thomas Jefferson did within a few days.', 'Thomas Jefferson later claimed that Thomas Jefferson was not striving for “originality of principle or sentiment,” only seeking to provide “an expression of the American mind”; that is, putting into words those ideas already accepted by a majority of Americans.', 'This accurately describes the longest section of the Declaration of Independence, which lists the grievances against George III.', 'It does not, however, describe the following 55 words, which are generally regarded as the seminal statement of American political culture: We hold these truths to be self-evident; that all men are created equal; that they are endowed by their Creator with certain inalienable rights; that among these are life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness; that to secure these rights, governments are instituted among men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed.', 'Thomas

passage, which over succeeding generations became the lyrical sanction for every liberal movement in American history.', 'At the time, Jefferson himself was disconsolate that the Congress had seen fit to make any changes in Thomas Jefferson language.', 'Nevertheless, Thomas Jefferson was not regarded by Thomas Jefferson contemporaries as the author of the Declaration, which was seen as a collective effort by the entire Congress.', 'Indeed, Thomas Jefferson was not known by most Americans as the principal author until the 1790s.', '(See primary source document: Declaration of Independence.)', 'Thomas Jefferson returned to Virginia in October 1776 and immediately launched an extensive project for the reform of the state’s legal code to bring it in line with the principles of the American Revolution.', 'Three areas of reform suggest the arc of Thomas Jefferson political vision: first, Thomas Jefferson sought and secured abolition of primogeniture, entail, and all those remnants of feudalism that discouraged a broad distribution of property; second, Thomas Jefferson proposed a comprehensive plan of educational reform designed to assure access at the lowest level for all citizens and state support at the higher levels for the most talented; third, Thomas Jefferson advocated a law prohibiting any religious establishment and requiring complete separation of church and state.', 'The last two proposals were bitterly contested, especially the statute for religious freedom, which was not enacted until 1786.', '(See primary source documents: An American Education for American Youth, The Education of Women, and The Sphere of Religion.)', 'Taken together, these legal reforms capture the essence of Jefferson’s political philosophy, which was less a comprehensive body of thought than a visionary prescription.', 'Thomas Jefferson regarded the past as a “dead hand” of encrusted privileges and impediments that must be cast off to permit the natural energies of individual citizens to flow freely.', 'The American Revolution, as Thomas Jefferson saw it, was the first shot in what would eventually became a global battle for human liberation from despotic institutions and all coercive versions of government.', 'At the end of what was probably the most creative phase of Thomas Jefferson public career, personal misfortune struck in two successive episodes.', 'Elected governor of Virginia in 1779, Thomas Jefferson was caught off-guard by a surprise British invasion in 1780 against which the state was defenseless.', 'Thomas Jefferson flight from approaching British troops was described in the local press, somewhat unfairly, as a cowardly act of abdication.', '(Critics would recall this awkward moment throughout the remainder of Thomas Jefferson long career.)',

Jefferson would never again desert Thomas Jefferson family for Thomas Jefferson country.', 'American in Paris The vow was sincere but short-lived.', 'Jefferson agreed, albeit reluctantly, to serve as a delegate to the Continental Congress in December 1782, where Thomas Jefferson major contribution was to set forth the principle that territories in the West should not be treated as colonies but rather should enter the Union with status equal to the original states once certain conditions were met.', 'Then, in 1784, recognizing the need to escape the memories of Martha that haunted the hallways at Monticello, Thomas Jefferson agreed to replace Franklin as American minister to France; or, as legend tells the story, Thomas Jefferson agreed to succeed Franklin, noting that no one could replace Thomas Jefferson.', 'During Thomas Jefferson five-year sojourn in Paris, Jefferson accomplished very little in any official sense.', 'Several intractable conditions rendered Thomas Jefferson best diplomatic efforts futile: the United States was heavily in debt owing to the recent war, so few European nations were interested in signing treaties of amity and commerce with the infant American republic; the federal government created under the Articles of Confederation was notoriously weak, so clear foreign policy directives proved impossible; Great Britain already enjoyed a monopoly, controlling more than 80 percent of America’s foreign trade, so it had no incentive to negotiate commercial treaties on less favourable terms; and France was drifting toward a cataclysmic political crisis of its own, so relations with the upstart new nation across the Atlantic were hardly a high priority.', 'As a result, Jefferson’s diplomatic overtures to establish a market for American tobacco and to reopen French ports to whale oil produced meagre results, Thomas Jefferson efforts to create an alliance of American and European powers to contest the terrorism of the Barbary pirates proved stillborn, and Thomas Jefferson vision of open markets for all nations, a world without tariffs, seemed excessively visionary.', 'Thomas Jefferson only significant achievement was the negotiation of a $400,000 loan from Dutch bankers that allowed the American government to consolidate its European debts, but even that piece of diplomacy was conducted primarily by John Adams, then serving as American minister to the Court of St. James’s in London.', 'But the Paris years were important to Jefferson for personal reasons and are important to biographers and historians for the new light they shed on Thomas Jefferson famously elusive personality.', 'The dominant pattern would seem to be the capacity to live comfortably with contradiction.', 'For example, Thomas Jefferson immersed himself wholeheartedly in the art, architecture, wine, and food  Thomas Jefferson   Jefferson, Thomas: memorandum to Mr. Short, 1788 of Parisian society but warned all prospective American tourists to remain in America so as to avoid the avarice, luxury, and sheer sinfulness of European fleshpots.', 'Thomas Jefferson made a point of bringing along Thomas Jefferson elder daughter, Martha (called Patsy as a girl), and later sent for Thomas Jefferson younger daughter, Maria (called Polly), all as part of Thomas Jefferson genuine devotion as a single parent.', 'But Thomas Jefferson then placed both daughters in a convent, wrote them stern lecturelike letters about proper female etiquette, and enforced a patriarchal distance that was in practice completely at odds with Thomas Jefferson theoretical commitment to intimacy.', 'With women in general Thomas Jefferson letters convey a message of conspicuous gallantry, playfully flirtatious in the manner of a male coquette.', 'The most self-revealing letter Thomas Jefferson ever wrote, “a dialogue between the head and the heart,” was sent to Maria Cosway, an Anglo-Italian beauty who left Thomas Jefferson utterly infatuated.', 'Jefferson and Cosway, who was married to a prominent if somewhat degenerate English miniaturist, spent several months in a romantic haze, touring Parisian gardens, museums, and art shows together, but whether Jefferson’s head or heart prevailed, either in the letter or in life, is impossible to know.', 'Meanwhile, there is considerable evidence to suggest, but not to prove conclusively, that Jefferson initiated a sexual liaison with Thomas Jefferson attractive young mulatto slave Sally Hemings in 1788, about the time Thomas Jefferson torrid affair with Cosway cooled down—this despite Thomas Jefferson public statements denouncing blacks as biologically inferior and sexual relations between the races as taboo.', '(See Sidebar: “Tom and Sally”: the Jefferson-Hemings paternity debate.)', 'During the latter stages of Jefferson’s stay in Paris, Louis XVI, the French king, was forced to convene the Assembly of Notables in Versailles to deal with France’s deep financial crisis.', 'Jefferson initially regarded the assembly as a French version of the Constitutional Convention, then meeting in Philadelphia.', 'Much influenced by moderate leaders such as the Marquis de Lafayette, Thomas Jefferson expected the French Revolution to remain a bloodless affair that would culminate in a revised French government, probably a constitutional monarchy along English lines.', 'Thomas Jefferson remained oblivious to the resentments and volatile energies pent up within French society that were about to explode in the Reign of Terror, mostly because Thomas Jefferson thought the French Revolution would follow the American model.', 'Thomas Jefferson was fortunate to depart France late in 1789, just at the onset of mob violence.', 'Slavery and racism  Thomas Jefferson   Jefferson, Thomas Even before Thomas Jefferson departure from France, Jefferson had overseen the publication of Notes on the State of Virginia.', 'This book, the only one Jefferson ever published, was part travel guide, part scientific treatise, and part philosophical meditation.', 'Jefferson had written it in the fall of 1781 and had agreed to a French edition only after learning that an unauthorized version was already in press.', 'Notes contained an extensive discussion of slavery, including a graphic description of its horrific effects on both blacks and whites, a strong assertion that it violated the principles on which the American Revolution was based, and an apocalyptic prediction that failure to end slavery would lead to “convulsions which will probably never end but in the extermination of one or the other race.” It also contained the most explicit assessment that Jefferson ever wrote of what Thomas Jefferson believed were the biological differences between blacks and whites, an assessment that exposed the deep- rooted racism that Thomas Jefferson, like most Americans and almost all Virginians of Thomas Jefferson day, harboured throughout Thomas Jefferson life.', 'To Thomas Jefferson critics in later generations, Jefferson’s views on race seemed particularly virulent because of Thomas Jefferson purported relationship with Sally Hemings, who bore several children obviously fathered by a white man and some of whom had features resembling those of Jefferson.', 'The public assertion of this relationship was originally made in 1802 by a disreputable journalist interested in injuring Jefferson’s political career.', 'Thomas Jefferson claim was corroborated, however, by one of Hemings’s children in an 1873 newspaper interview and then again in a 1968 book by Winthrop Jordan revealing that Hemings became pregnant only when Jefferson was present at Monticello.', 'Finally, in 1998, DNA samples were gathered from living descendants of Jefferson and Hemings.', 'Tests revealed that Jefferson was almost certainly the father of some of Hemings’s children.', 'What remained unclear was the character of the relationship—consensual or coercive, a matter of love or rape, or a mutually satisfactory arrangement.', 'Jefferson’s admirers preferred to consider it a love affair and to see Jefferson and Hemings as America’s preeminent biracial couple.', 'Thomas Jefferson critics, on the other hand, considered Jefferson a sexual predator whose eloquent statements about human freedom and equality were hypocritical.', 'In any case, coming as it did at the midpoint of Jefferson’s career, the publication of Notes affords the opportunity to review Jefferson’s previous and subsequent positions on the most volatile and therefore most forbidden topic in the revolutionary era (see primary source document: On Accommodating African Americans).', 'Early in Thomas Jefferson career Jefferson had taken  Thomas Jefferson   a leadership role in pushing slavery onto the political agenda in the Virginia assembly and the federal Congress.', 'In the 1760s and ’70s, like most Virginia planters, Thomas Jefferson endorsed the end of the slave trade.', '(Virginia’s plantations were already well stocked with slaves, so ending the slave trade posed no economic threat and even enhanced the value of the existent slave population.)', 'In Thomas Jefferson original draft of the Declaration of Independence, Thomas Jefferson included a passage, subsequently deleted by the Continental Congress, blaming both the slave trade and slavery itself on George III.', 'Unlike most of Thomas Jefferson fellow Virginians, Jefferson was prepared to acknowledge that slavery was an anomaly in the American republic established in 1776.', 'Thomas Jefferson two most practical proposals came in the early 1780s: a gradual emancipation scheme by which all slaves born after 1800 would be freed and their owners compensated, and a prohibition of slavery in all the territories of the West as a condition for admission to the Union.', 'By the time of the publication of Notes, then, Jefferson’s record on slavery placed Thomas Jefferson among the most progressive elements of southern society.', 'Rather than ask how Thomas Jefferson could possibly tolerate the persistence of slavery, it is more historically correct to wonder how this member of Virginia’s planter class had managed to develop such liberal convictions.', 'Dating the onset of a long silence is inevitably an imprecise business, but by the time of Thomas Jefferson return to the United States in 1789 Jefferson had backed away from a leadership position on slavery.', 'The ringing denunciations of slavery presented in Notes had generated controversy, especially within the planter class of Virginia, and Jefferson’s deep aversion to controversy made Thomas Jefferson withdraw from the cutting edge of the antislavery movement once Thomas Jefferson experienced the sharp feelings it aroused.', 'Moreover, the very logic of Thomas Jefferson argument in Notes exposed the inherent intractability of Thomas Jefferson position.', 'Although Thomas Jefferson believed that slavery was a gross violation of the principles celebrated in the Declaration of Independence, Thomas Jefferson also believed that people of African descent were biologically inferior to whites and could never live alongside whites in peace and harmony.', 'They would have to be transported elsewhere, back to Africa or perhaps the Caribbean, after emancipation.', 'Because such a massive deportation was a logistical and economic impossibility, the unavoidable conclusion was that, though slavery was wrong, ending it, at least at present, was inconceivable.', 'That became Jefferson’s public position throughout the remainder of Thomas Jefferson life.', 'It also shaped Thomas Jefferson personal posture as a slave owner.', 'Jefferson owned, on average, about 200 slaves at any point in time, and slightly over 600 over Thomas Jefferson lifetime.', 'To protect himself from facing the reality of Thomas Jefferson problematic status as plantation master, Thomas Jefferson constructed a paternalistic self-image as a benevolent father caring for what Thomas Jefferson called “my family.” Believing that Thomas Jefferson and Thomas Jefferson slaves were the victims of history’s failure to proceed along the  Thomas Jefferson   Peale, Charles Willson: portrait of Thomas Jefferson enlightened path, Thomas Jefferson saw himself as the steward for those entrusted to Thomas Jefferson care

answers than a framework for arguing about the salient questions.', 'And because Jefferson had been serving in France when the constitutional battles of 1787–88 were waged in Philadelphia and then in the state ratifying conventions, Thomas Jefferson entered the volatile debates of the 1790s without a clear track record of Thomas Jefferson constitutional convictions.', 'In truth, unlike Thomas

ongoing competition for supremacy in Europe between England and France produced a bitter conflict.', 'Washington and Adams, who was serving as vice president, insisted on complete neutrality, which in practice meant tacking back and forth between the two dominant world powers of the moment.', 'Alexander Hamilton pushed for a pro-English version of neutrality—chiefly commercial ties with the  Thomas

past French support during the war for independence, and that the French Revolution embodied the “spirit of ’76” on European soil.', 'Even when the French Revolution spun out of control and began to devour its own partisans, Jefferson insisted that these bloody convulsions were only temporary excesses justified by the larger ideological issues at stake.', 'This remained Thomas Jefferson unwavering position throughout the decade.', 'Even after Thomas Jefferson retired from office late in 1793, Thomas Jefferson issued directives from Monticello opposing the Neutrality Act (1793) and the Jay Treaty (1795) as pacts with the British harlot and betrayals of our French brethren.', 'Serving as vice president during the Adams presidency (1797–1801), Jefferson worked behind the scenes to undermine Adams’s efforts to sustain strict neutrality and blamed the outbreak of the “quasi-war” with France in 1797–98 on what Thomas Jefferson called “our American Anglophiles” rather than the French Directory.', 'Thomas Jefferson foreign-policy vision was resolutely moralistic and highly ideological, dominated by a dichotomous view of England as a corrupt and degenerate engine of despotism and France as the enlightened wave of the future.', 'Jefferson’s position on domestic policy during the 1790s was a variation on the same ideological dichotomy.', 'As Hamilton began to construct Thomas Jefferson extensive financial program—to include funding the national debt, assuming the state debts, and creating a national bank— Jefferson came to regard the consolidation of power at the federal level as a diabolical plot to subvert the true meaning of the American Revolution.', 'As Jefferson saw it, the entire Federalist commitment to an energetic central government with broad powers over the domestic economy replicated the arbitrary policies of Parliament and George III, which the American Revolution had supposedly repudiated as monarchical and aristocratic practices, incompatible with the principles of republicanism.', 'Jefferson sincerely believed that the “principles of ’76” were being betrayed by a Federalist version of the “court party,” whose covert scheme was to install monarchy and a pseudo-aristocracy of bankers and “monocrats” to rule over the American yeomanry.', 'All the major events of the decade—the creation of a national bank, the debate over the location of a national capital, the suppression of the Whiskey Rebellion in western Pennsylvania, the passage of the Jay Treaty, and, most notoriously, the enforcement of the Alien and Sedition Acts—were viewed through this ideological lens.', 'By the middle years of the decade two distinctive political camps had emerged, calling themselves Federalists  Thomas Jefferson   and Republicans

the rudiments of the first opposition party in American politics under the Republican banner.', 'The partnership between Jefferson and Madison, labeled by subsequent historians as “the great collaboration,” deserves special attention.', 'John Quincy Adams put it nicely when Thomas Jefferson observed that “the mutual influence of these two mighty minds on each other is a phenomenon, like the invisible and mysterious movements of the magnet in the physical world.” Because the notion of a legitimate opposition to the elected government did not yet exist, and because the term party remained an epithet that was synonymous with faction, meaning an organized effort to undermine the public interest, Jefferson and Madison were labeled as traitors by the Federalist press.', 'They were, in effect, inventing a modern form of political behaviour before there was any neutral vocabulary for talking about it.', 'Jefferson’s own capacity to live comfortably with contradictions served Thomas Jefferson well in this context, since Thomas Jefferson was creating and leading a political party while insisting that parties were evil agents.', 'In 1796 Thomas Jefferson ran for the presidency against Adams, all the while claiming not to know that Thomas Jefferson was even a candidate.', 'Most negative assessments of Jefferson’s character date from this period, especially the charge of hypocrisy and duplicity.', 'The highly combustible political culture of the early republic reached a crescendo in the election of 1800, one of the most fiercely contested campaigns in American history.', '(See primary source document: Jefferson and Liberty.)', 'The Federalist press described Jefferson as a pagan and atheist, a treasonable conspirator against the duly elected administrations of Washington and Adams, a utopian dreamer with anarchistic tendencies toward the role of government, and a cunning behind-the-scenes manipulator of Republican propaganda.', 'All these charges were gross exaggerations, save the last.', 'Always operating through intermediaries, Jefferson paid several journalists to libel Adams, Thomas Jefferson old friend but current political enemy, and offered the vice presidency to Aaron Burr in return for delivering the electoral votes of New York.', 'In the final tally the 12 New York votes made the difference, with the tandem of Jefferson and Burr winning 73 to 65.', 'A quirk in the Constitution, subsequently corrected in the Twelfth Amendment, prevented electors from distinguishing between their choice of president and vice president, so Jefferson and Burr tied for the top spot, even though voter preference for Jefferson was incontestable.', 'The decision was  Thomas Jefferson   thrown into the House of Representatives where, after several weeks of debate and backroom wheeling and dealing, Jefferson was elected on the 36th ballot.', 'Presidency There was a good deal of nervous speculation whether the new American nation could survive a Jefferson presidency.', 'The entire thrust of Jefferson’s political position throughout the 1790s had been defiantly negative, rejecting as excessive the powers vested in the national government by the Federalists.', 'In Thomas Jefferson Virginia Resolutions of 1798, written in protest of the Alien and Sedition Acts, Thomas Jefferson had described any projection of federal authority over the domestic policy of the states as a violation of “the spirit of ’76” and therefore a justification for secession from the Union.', '(This became the position of the Confederacy in 1861.)', 'Thomas Jefferson Federalist critics wondered how Thomas Jefferson could take an oath to preserve, protect, and defend the Constitution of the United States if Thomas Jefferson primary goal as president was to dismantle the federal institutions created by that very document.', 'As Thomas Jefferson rose to deliver Thomas Jefferson inaugural address on March 4, 1801, in the still-unfinished Capitol of the equally unfinished national capital on the Potomac, the mood was apprehensive.', 'The most rabid alarmists had already been proved wrong, since the first transfer of power from one political regime to another had occurred peacefully, even routinely.', 'But it was still very much an open question whether, as Lincoln later put it, “any nation so conceived and so dedicated could long endure” in the absence of a central government along Federalist lines.', 'The major message of Jefferson’s inaugural address was conciliatory.', 'Its most famous line (“We are all republicans—we are all federalists”) suggested that the scatological party battles of the previous decade must cease.', 'Thomas Jefferson described Thomas Jefferson election as a recovery of the original intentions of the American Revolution, this after the hostile takeover of those “ancient and sacred truths” by the Federalists, who had erroneously assumed that a stable American nation required a powerful central government.', 'In Jefferson’s truly distinctive and original formulation, the coherence of the American republic did not require the mechanisms of a powerful state to survive or flourish.', 'Indeed, the health of the emerging American nation was inversely proportional to the power of the federal government, for in the end the sovereign source of republican government was voluntary popular opinion, “the people,” and the latent energies these liberated individuals released when unburdened by government restrictions.', 'In 1804 Jefferson was easily reelected over Federalist Charles Cotesworth Pinckney, winning 162 electoral votes to Pinckney’s 14.', 'Initially, at least, Thomas Jefferson policies as president reflected Thomas Jefferson desire for decentralization, which meant dismantling the embryonic federal  Thomas Jefferson   government, the army and navy, and all federal taxation programs, as well as placing the national debt, which stood at $112 million, on the road to extinction.', 'These reforms enjoyed considerable success for two reasons.', 'First, the temporary cessation of the war between England and France for European supremacy permitted American merchants to trade with both sides and produced unprecedented national prosperity.', 'Second, in selecting Albert Gallatin as secretary of the Treasury, Jefferson placed one of the most capable managers of fiscal policy in the most strategic location.', 'Gallatin, a Swiss-born prodigy with impeccable Republican credentials, dominated the cabinet discussions alongside Madison, the ever-loyal Jefferson disciple who served as secretary of state.', 'Actually there were very few cabinet discussions because Jefferson preferred to do the bulk of business within the executive branch in writing.', 'Crafting language on the page was Thomas Jefferson most obvious talent, and Thomas Jefferson required all cabinet officers to submit drafts of their recommendations, which Thomas Jefferson then edited and returned for their comments.', 'The same textual approach applied to Thomas Jefferson dealings with Congress.', 'All of Thomas Jefferson annual messages were delivered in writing rather than in person.', 'Indeed, apart from Thomas Jefferson two inaugural addresses (see primary source documents: First Inaugural Address and Second Inaugural Address), there is no record of Jefferson delivering any public speeches whatsoever.', 'In part this was a function of Thomas Jefferson notoriously inadequate abilities as an orator, but it also reflected Thomas Jefferson desire to make the office of the presidency almost invisible.', 'Thomas Jefferson one gesture at visibility was to schedule weekly dinners when Congress was in session, which became famous for the quality of the wine, the pell-mell seating arrangements, and informal approach to etiquette —a clear defiance of European-style decorum.', 'The major achievement of Thomas Jefferson first term was also an act of defiance, though this time it involved defying Thomas Jefferson own principles.', 'In 1803 Napoleon decided to consolidate Thomas Jefferson resources for a new round of the conflict with England by selling the vast Louisiana region, which stretched from the Mississippi Valley to the Rocky Mountains.', 'Although the asking price, $15 million, was a stupendous bargain, assuming the cost meant substantially increasing the national debt.', 'More significantly, what became known as the Louisiana Purchase violated Jefferson’s constitutional scruples.', 'Indeed, many historians regard it as the boldest executive action in American history.', 'But Jefferson never wavered, reasoning that the opportunity to double the national domain was too good to miss.', 'The American West always triggered Jefferson’s most visionary energies, seeing it, as Thomas Jefferson did, as America’s future, the place where the simple republican principles could be constantly renewed.', 'In one fell swoop Thomas Jefferson removed the threat of a major European power from America’s borders and extended the life span of the uncluttered agrarian values Thomas Jefferson so cherished.', 'Even before  Thomas Jefferson   news that the purchase was approved reached the United States in July 1803, Jefferson dispatched Thomas Jefferson private secretary, Meriwether Lewis, to lead an expedition to explore the new acquisition and the lands beyond, all the way to the Pacific.', 'If the Louisiana Purchase was the crowning achievement of Jefferson’s presidency, it also proved to be the high point from which events moved steadily in the other direction.', 'Although the Federalist Party was dead as a national force, pockets of Federalist opposition still survived, especially in New England.', 'Despite Thomas Jefferson eloquent testimonials to the need for a free press, Jefferson was outraged by the persistent attacks on Thomas Jefferson policies and character from those quarters, and Thomas Jefferson instructed the attorneys general in the recalcitrant states to seek indictments, in clear violation of Thomas Jefferson principled commitment to freedom of expression (see primary source document: On Misreporting by the Press).', 'Thomas Jefferson was equally heavy-handed in Thomas Jefferson treatment of Aaron Burr, who was tried for treason after leading a mysterious expedition into the American Southwest allegedly designed to detach that region from the United States with Burr crowned as its benevolent dictator.', 'The charges were never proved, but Jefferson demanded Burr’s conviction despite the lack of evidence.', 'Thomas Jefferson was overruled in the end by Chief Justice John Marshall, who sat as the judge in the trial.', 'But Jefferson’s major disappointment had its origins in Europe with the resumption of the Napoleonic Wars, which resulted in naval blockades in the Atlantic and Caribbean that severely curtailed American trade and pressured the U.S. government to take sides in the conflict.', 'Jefferson’s response was the Embargo Act (1807), which essentially closed American ports to all foreign imports and American exports.', 'The embargo assumed that the loss of American trade would force England and France to alter their policies, but this fond hope was always an illusion, since the embryonic American economy lacked the size to generate such influence and was itself wrecked by Jefferson’s action.', 'Moreover, the enforcement of the Embargo Act required the exercise of precisely those coercive powers by the federal government that Jefferson had previously opposed.', 'By the time Thomas Jefferson left office in March 1809, Jefferson was a tired and beaten man, anxious to escape the consequences of Thomas Jefferson futile efforts to preserve American neutrality and eager to embrace the two-term precedent established by Washington.', 'Retirement During the last 17 years of Thomas Jefferson life Jefferson maintained a crowded and active schedule.', 'Thomas Jefferson rose with the dawn each day, bathed Thomas Jefferson feet in cold water, then spent the morning on Thomas Jefferson correspondence (one year Thomas Jefferson counted writing 1,268 letters) and working in Thomas Jefferson garden.', 'Each afternoon Thomas Jefferson took a two-hour ride around Thomas Jefferson grounds.', 'Dinner, served in the late  Thomas Jefferson   Rembrandt Peale: portrait of Thomas Jefferson afternoon, was usually an occasion to gather Thomas Jefferson daughter Martha and Thomas Jefferson 12 children, along with the inevitable visitors.', 'Monticello became a veritable hotel during these years, on occasion housing 50 guests.', 'The lack of privacy caused Jefferson to build a separate house on Thomas Jefferson Bedford estate about 90 miles (140 km) from Monticello, where Thomas Jefferson periodically fled for seclusion.', 'Three architectural projects claimed a considerable share of Thomas Jefferson attention.', 'Throughout Thomas Jefferson life Monticello remained a work-in-progress that had the appearance of a construction site.', 'Even during Thomas Jefferson retirement years, Jefferson’s intensive efforts at completing the renovations never quite produced the masterpiece of neoclassical design Thomas Jefferson wanted to achieve and that modern-day visitors to Monticello find so compelling.', 'A smaller but more architecturally distinctive mansion at Bedford, called Poplar Forest, was completed on schedule.', 'It too embodied neoclassical principles but was shaped as a perfect octagon.', 'Finally there was the campus of the University of Virginia at Charlottesville, which Jefferson called Thomas Jefferson “academical village.” Jefferson surveyed the site, which Thomas Jefferson could view in the distance from Thomas Jefferson mountaintop, and chose the Pantheon of Rome as the model for the rotunda, the centrepiece flanked by two rows of living quarters for students and faculty.', 'In 1976 the American Institute of Architects voted it “the proudest achievement of American architecture in the past 200 years.” Even the “interior” design of the University of Virginia embodied Jeffersonian principles, in that Thomas Jefferson selected all the books for the library, defined the curriculum, picked the faculty, and chaired the Board of Visitors.', 'Unlike every other American college at the time, “Mr.', 'Jefferson’s university” had no religious affiliation and imposed no religious requirement on its students.', 'As befitted an institution shaped by a believer in wholly voluntary and consensual networks of governance, there were no curricular requirements, no mandatory code of conduct except the self-enforced honour system, no president or administration.', 'Every aspect of life at the University of Virginia reflected Jefferson’s belief that the only legitimate form of governance was self-governance.', 'In 1812 Thomas Jefferson vast correspondence began to include an exchange with Thomas Jefferson former friend and more recent rival John Adams.', 'The reconciliation between the two patriarchs was arranged by their mutual friend Benjamin Rush, who described them as “the North and South poles  Thomas Jefferson   of the American Revolution.” That description suggested more than merely geographic symbolism, since Adams and Jefferson effectively, even dramatically, embodied the twin impulses of the revolutionary generation.', 'As the “Sage of Monticello,” Jefferson represented the Revolution as a clean break with the past, the rejection of all European versions of political discipline as feudal vestiges, the ingrained hostility toward all mechanisms of governmental authority that originated in faraway places.', 'As the “Sage of Quincy (Massachusetts),” Adams resembled an American version of Edmund Burke, which meant that Thomas Jefferson attributed the success of the American Revolution to its linkage with past practices, most especially the tradition of representative government established in the colonial assemblies.', 'Thomas Jefferson regarded the constitutional settlement of 1787–88 as a shrewd compromise with the political necessities of a nation-state exercising jurisdiction over an extensive, eventually continental, empire, not as a betrayal of the American Revolution but an evolutionary fulfillment of its promise.', 'These genuine differences of opinion made Adams and Jefferson the odd couple of the American Revolution and were the primary reasons why they had drifted to different sides of the divide during the party wars of the 1790s.', 'The exchange of 158 letters between 1812 and 1826 permitted the two sages to pose as philosopher-kings and create what is arguably the most intellectually impressive correspondence between statesmen in all of American history.', 'Beyond the elegiac tone and almost sculpted serenity of the letters, the correspondence exposed the fundamental contradictions that the American Revolution managed to contain.', 'As Adams so poignantly put it, “You and I ought not to die before we have explained ourselves to each other.” And because of Adams’s incessant prodding, Jefferson was frequently forced to clarify Thomas Jefferson mature position on the most salient issues of the era.', 'One issue that even Adams and Jefferson could not discuss candidly was slavery.', 'Jefferson’s mature position on that forbidden subject represented a further retreat from any leadership role in ending the “peculiar institution.” In 1819, during the debate in Congress over the Missouri Compromise, Thomas Jefferson endorsed the expansion of slavery into all the western territories, precisely the opposite of the position Thomas Jefferson had taken in the 1780s.', 'Though Thomas Jefferson continued to insist that slavery was a massive anomaly, Thomas Jefferson insisted even more strongly that it was wrong for the federal government to attempt any effort at emancipation.', 'In fact Thomas Jefferson described any federal intrusion in the matter as a despotic act analogous to George III’s imperial interference in colonial affairs or Hamilton’s corrupt scheme to establish a disguised form of monarchy in the early republic.', 'Thomas Jefferson letters to fellow Virginians during Thomas Jefferson  Thomas Jefferson   last years reflect a conspiratorial mentality toward the national government and a clear preference for secession if threatened with any mandatory plan for abolition.', 'Apart from slavery, the other shadow that darkened Monticello during Jefferson’s twilight years was debt.', 'Jefferson was chronically in debt throughout most of Thomas Jefferson life, in part because of obligations inherited from Thomas Jefferson father-in-law in Thomas Jefferson wife’s dowry, mostly because of Thomas Jefferson own lavish lifestyle, which never came to terms with the proverbial bottom line despite careful entries in Thomas Jefferson account books that provided Thomas Jefferson with only the illusion of control.', 'In truth, by the 1820s the interest on Thomas Jefferson debt was compounding at a faster rate than any repayment schedule could meet.', 'By the end, Thomas Jefferson was more than $100,000—in modern terms several million dollars—in debt.', 'An exception was made in Virginia law to permit a lottery that Jefferson hoped would allow Thomas Jefferson heirs to retain at least a portion of Thomas Jefferson property.', 'But the massiveness of Thomas Jefferson debt overwhelmed all such hopes.', 'Monticello, including land, mansion, furnishings, and the vast bulk of the slave population, was auctioned off the year after Thomas Jefferson

Ellis']","Thomas Jefferson Memorial Thomas Jefferson, (born April 2 [April 13, New Style], 1743, Shadwell, Virginia [U.S.]—died July 4, 1826, Monticello, Virginia, U.S.), draftsman of the Declaration of Independence of the United States and the nation’s first secretary of state (1789–94) and second vice president (1797–1801) and, as the third president (1801–09), the statesman responsible for the Louisiana Purchase. An early advocate of total separation of church and state, he also was the founder and architect of the University of Virginia and the most eloquent American proponent of individual freedom as the core meaning of the American Revolution. Long regarded as America’s most distinguished “apostle of liberty,” Jefferson has come under increasingly critical scrutiny within the scholarly world. At the popular level, both in the United States and abroad, he remains an incandescent icon, an inspirational symbol for both major U.S. political parties, as well as for dissenters in communist China, liberal reformers in central and eastern Europe, and aspiring democrats in Africa and Latin America. His image within scholarly circles has suffered, however, as the focus on racial equality has prompted a more negative reappraisal of his dependence upon slavery and his conviction that American society remain a white man’s domain. The huge gap between his lyrical expression of liberal ideals and the more attenuated reality of his own life has transformed Jefferson into America’s most problematic and paradoxical hero. The Jefferson Memorial in Washington, D.C., was dedicated to him on April 13, 1943, the 200th anniversary of his birth. Early years Albermarle county, where Jefferson was born, lay in the foothills of the Blue Ridge Mountains in what was then regarded as a western province of the Old Dominion. His father, Peter Jefferson, was a self-educated surveyor who amassed a tidy estate that  Thomas Jefferson   Monticello included 60 slaves. According to family lore, Jefferson’s earliest memory was as a three- year-old boy “being carried on a pillow by a mounted slave” when the family moved from Shadwell to Tuckahoe. His mother, Jane Randolph Jefferson, was descended from one of the most prominent families in Virginia. She raised two sons, of whom Jefferson was the eldest, and six daughters. There is reason to believe that Jefferson’s relationship with his mother was strained, especially after his father died in 1757, because he did everything he could to escape her supervision and had almost nothing to say about her in his memoirs. He boarded with the local schoolmaster to learn his Latin and Greek until 1760, when he entered the College of William & Mary in Williamsburg. By all accounts he was an obsessive student, often spending 15 hours of the day with his books, 3 hours practicing his violin, and the remaining 6 hours eating and sleeping. The two chief influences on his learning were William Small, a Scottish-born teacher of mathematics and science, and George Wythe, the leading legal scholar in Virginia. From them Jefferson learned a keen appreciation of supportive mentors, a concept he later institutionalized at the University of Virginia. He read law with Wythe from 1762 to 1767, then left Williamsburg to practice, mostly representing small-scale planters from the western counties in cases involving land claims and titles. Although he handled no landmark cases and came across as a nervous and somewhat indifferent speaker before the bench, he earned a reputation as a formidable legal scholar. He was a shy and extremely serious young man. In 1768 he made two important decisions: first, to build his own home atop an 867-foot- (264-metre-) high mountain near Shadwell that he eventually named Monticello and, second, to stand as a candidate for the House of Burgesses. These decisions nicely embodied the two competing impulses that would persist throughout his life— namely, to combine an active career in politics with periodic seclusion in his own private haven. His political timing was also impeccable, for he entered the Virginia legislature just as opposition to the taxation policies of the British Parliament was congealing. Although he made few speeches and tended to follow the lead of the Tidewater elite, his support for resolutions opposing Parliament’s authority over the colonies was resolute. In the early 1770s his own character was also congealing. In 1772 he married Martha Wayles Skelton (Martha Jefferson), an attractive and delicate young widow whose dowry  Thomas Jefferson   Trumbull, John: Declaration of Independence more than doubled his holdings in land and slaves. In 1774 he wrote A Summary View of the Rights of British America, which was quickly published, though without his permission, and catapulted him into visibility beyond Virginia as an early advocate of American independence from Parliament’s authority; the American colonies were tied to Great Britain, he believed, only by wholly voluntary bonds of loyalty to the king. His reputation thus enhanced, the Virginia legislature appointed him a delegate to the Second Continental Congress in the spring of 1775. He rode into Philadelphia—and into American history—on June 20, 1775, a tall (slightly above 6 feet 2 inches [1.88 metres]) and gangly young man with reddish blond hair, hazel eyes, a burnished complexion, and rock-ribbed certainty about the American cause. In retrospect, the central paradox of his life was also on display, for the man who the following year was to craft the most famous manifesto for human equality in world history arrived in an ornate carriage drawn by four handsome horses and accompanied by three slaves. Declaring independence Jefferson’s inveterate shyness prevented him from playing a significant role in the debates within the Congress. John Adams, a leader in those debates, remembered that Jefferson was silent even in committee meetings, though consistently staunch in his support for independence. His chief role was as a draftsman of resolutions. In that capacity, on June 11, 1776, he was appointed to a five- person committee, which also included Adams and Benjamin Franklin, to draft a formal statement of the reasons why a break with Great Britain was justified. Adams asked him to prepare the first draft, which he did within a few days. He later claimed that he was not striving for “originality of principle or sentiment,” only seeking to provide “an expression of the American mind”; that is, putting into words those ideas already accepted by a majority of Americans. This accurately describes the longest section of the Declaration of Independence, which lists the grievances against George III. It does not, however, describe the following 55 words, which are generally regarded as the seminal statement of American political culture: We hold these truths to be self-evident; that all men are created equal; that they are endowed by their Creator with certain inalienable rights; that among these are life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness; that to secure these rights, governments are instituted among men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed. Thomas Jefferson   Declaration of Independence On July 3–4 the Congress debated and edited Jefferson’s draft, deleting and revising fully one-fifth of the text. But they made no changes whatsoever in this passage, which over succeeding generations became the lyrical sanction for every liberal movement in American history. At the time, Jefferson himself was disconsolate that the Congress had seen fit to make any changes in his language. Nevertheless, he was not regarded by his contemporaries as the author of the Declaration, which was seen as a collective effort by the entire Congress. Indeed, he was not known by most Americans as the principal author until the 1790s. (See primary source document: Declaration of Independence.) He returned to Virginia in October 1776 and immediately launched an extensive project for the reform of the state’s legal code to bring it in line with the principles of the American Revolution. Three areas of reform suggest the arc of his political vision: first, he sought and secured abolition of primogeniture, entail, and all those remnants of feudalism that discouraged a broad distribution of property; second, he proposed a comprehensive plan of educational reform designed to assure access at the lowest level for all citizens and state support at the higher levels for the most talented; third, he advocated a law prohibiting any religious establishment and requiring complete separation of church and state. The last two proposals were bitterly contested, especially the statute for religious freedom, which was not enacted until 1786. (See primary source documents: An American Education for American Youth, The Education of Women, and The Sphere of Religion.) Taken together, these legal reforms capture the essence of Jefferson’s political philosophy, which was less a comprehensive body of thought than a visionary prescription. He regarded the past as a “dead hand” of encrusted privileges and impediments that must be cast off to permit the natural energies of individual citizens to flow freely. The American Revolution, as he saw it, was the first shot in what would eventually became a global battle for human liberation from despotic institutions and all coercive versions of government. At the end of what was probably the most creative phase of his public career, personal misfortune struck in two successive episodes. Elected governor of Virginia in 1779, he was caught off-guard by a surprise British invasion in 1780 against which the state was defenseless. His flight from approaching British troops was described in the local press, somewhat unfairly, as a cowardly act of abdication. (Critics would recall this awkward moment throughout the remainder of his long career.) Then, in September 1782, his wife  Thomas Jefferson   died after a difficult delivery in May of their third daughter. These two disasters caused him to vow that he would never again desert his family for his country. American in Paris The vow was sincere but short-lived. Jefferson agreed, albeit reluctantly, to serve as a delegate to the Continental Congress in December 1782, where his major contribution was to set forth the principle that territories in the West should not be treated as colonies but rather should enter the Union with status equal to the original states once certain conditions were met. Then, in 1784, recognizing the need to escape the memories of Martha that haunted the hallways at Monticello, he agreed to replace Franklin as American minister to France; or, as legend tells the story, he agreed to succeed Franklin, noting that no one could replace him. During his five-year sojourn in Paris, Jefferson accomplished very little in any official sense. Several intractable conditions rendered his best diplomatic efforts futile: the United States was heavily in debt owing to the recent war, so few European nations were interested in signing treaties of amity and commerce with the infant American republic; the federal government created under the Articles of Confederation was notoriously weak, so clear foreign policy directives proved impossible; Great Britain already enjoyed a monopoly, controlling more than 80 percent of America’s foreign trade, so it had no incentive to negotiate commercial treaties on less favourable terms; and France was drifting toward a cataclysmic political crisis of its own, so relations with the upstart new nation across the Atlantic were hardly a high priority. As a result, Jefferson’s diplomatic overtures to establish a market for American tobacco and to reopen French ports to whale oil produced meagre results, his efforts to create an alliance of American and European powers to contest the terrorism of the Barbary pirates proved stillborn, and his vision of open markets for all nations, a world without tariffs, seemed excessively visionary. His only significant achievement was the negotiation of a $400,000 loan from Dutch bankers that allowed the American government to consolidate its European debts, but even that piece of diplomacy was conducted primarily by John Adams, then serving as American minister to the Court of St. James’s in London. But the Paris years were important to Jefferson for personal reasons and are important to biographers and historians for the new light they shed on his famously elusive personality. The dominant pattern would seem to be the capacity to live comfortably with contradiction. For example, he immersed himself wholeheartedly in the art, architecture, wine, and food  Thomas Jefferson   Jefferson, Thomas: memorandum to Mr. Short, 1788 of Parisian society but warned all prospective American tourists to remain in America so as to avoid the avarice, luxury, and sheer sinfulness of European fleshpots. He made a point of bringing along his elder daughter, Martha (called Patsy as a girl), and later sent for his younger daughter, Maria (called Polly), all as part of his genuine devotion as a single parent. But he then placed both daughters in a convent, wrote them stern lecturelike letters about proper female etiquette, and enforced a patriarchal distance that was in practice completely at odds with his theoretical commitment to intimacy. With women in general his letters convey a message of conspicuous gallantry, playfully flirtatious in the manner of a male coquette. The most self-revealing letter he ever wrote, “a dialogue between the head and the heart,” was sent to Maria Cosway, an Anglo-Italian beauty who left him utterly infatuated. Jefferson and Cosway, who was married to a prominent if somewhat degenerate English miniaturist, spent several months in a romantic haze, touring Parisian gardens, museums, and art shows together, but whether Jefferson’s head or heart prevailed, either in the letter or in life, is impossible to know. Meanwhile, there is considerable evidence to suggest, but not to prove conclusively, that Jefferson initiated a sexual liaison with his attractive young mulatto slave Sally Hemings in 1788, about the time his torrid affair with Cosway cooled down—this despite his public statements denouncing blacks as biologically inferior and sexual relations between the races as taboo. (See Sidebar: “Tom and Sally”: the Jefferson-Hemings paternity debate.) During the latter stages of Jefferson’s stay in Paris, Louis XVI, the French king, was forced to convene the Assembly of Notables in Versailles to deal with France’s deep financial crisis. Jefferson initially regarded the assembly as a French version of the Constitutional Convention, then meeting in Philadelphia. Much influenced by moderate leaders such as the Marquis de Lafayette, he expected the French Revolution to remain a bloodless affair that would culminate in a revised French government, probably a constitutional monarchy along English lines. He remained oblivious to the resentments and volatile energies pent up within French society that were about to explode in the Reign of Terror, mostly because he thought the French Revolution would follow the American model. He was fortunate to depart France late in 1789, just at the onset of mob violence. Slavery and racism  Thomas Jefferson   Jefferson, Thomas Even before his departure from France, Jefferson had overseen the publication of Notes on the State of Virginia. This book, the only one Jefferson ever published, was part travel guide, part scientific treatise, and part philosophical meditation. Jefferson had written it in the fall of 1781 and had agreed to a French edition only after learning that an unauthorized version was already in press. Notes contained an extensive discussion of slavery, including a graphic description of its horrific effects on both blacks and whites, a strong assertion that it violated the principles on which the American Revolution was based, and an apocalyptic prediction that failure to end slavery would lead to “convulsions which will probably never end but in the extermination of one or the other race.” It also contained the most explicit assessment that Jefferson ever wrote of what he believed were the biological differences between blacks and whites, an assessment that exposed the deep- rooted racism that he, like most Americans and almost all Virginians of his day, harboured throughout his life. To his critics in later generations, Jefferson’s views on race seemed particularly virulent because of his purported relationship with Sally Hemings, who bore several children obviously fathered by a white man and some of whom had features resembling those of Jefferson. The public assertion of this relationship was originally made in 1802 by a disreputable journalist interested in injuring Jefferson’s political career. His claim was corroborated, however, by one of Hemings’s children in an 1873 newspaper interview and then again in a 1968 book by Winthrop Jordan revealing that Hemings became pregnant only when Jefferson was present at Monticello. Finally, in 1998, DNA samples were gathered from living descendants of Jefferson and Hemings. Tests revealed that Jefferson was almost certainly the father of some of Hemings’s children. What remained unclear was the character of the relationship—consensual or coercive, a matter of love or rape, or a mutually satisfactory arrangement. Jefferson’s admirers preferred to consider it a love affair and to see Jefferson and Hemings as America’s preeminent biracial couple. His critics, on the other hand, considered Jefferson a sexual predator whose eloquent statements about human freedom and equality were hypocritical. In any case, coming as it did at the midpoint of Jefferson’s career, the publication of Notes affords the opportunity to review Jefferson’s previous and subsequent positions on the most volatile and therefore most forbidden topic in the revolutionary era (see primary source document: On Accommodating African Americans). Early in his career Jefferson had taken  Thomas Jefferson   a leadership role in pushing slavery onto the political agenda in the Virginia assembly and the federal Congress. In the 1760s and ’70s, like most Virginia planters, he endorsed the end of the slave trade. (Virginia’s plantations were already well stocked with slaves, so ending the slave trade posed no economic threat and even enhanced the value of the existent slave population.) In his original draft of the Declaration of Independence, he included a passage, subsequently deleted by the Continental Congress, blaming both the slave trade and slavery itself on George III. Unlike most of his fellow Virginians, Jefferson was prepared to acknowledge that slavery was an anomaly in the American republic established in 1776. His two most practical proposals came in the early 1780s: a gradual emancipation scheme by which all slaves born after 1800 would be freed and their owners compensated, and a prohibition of slavery in all the territories of the West as a condition for admission to the Union. By the time of the publication of Notes, then, Jefferson’s record on slavery placed him among the most progressive elements of southern society. Rather than ask how he could possibly tolerate the persistence of slavery, it is more historically correct to wonder how this member of Virginia’s planter class had managed to develop such liberal convictions. Dating the onset of a long silence is inevitably an imprecise business, but by the time of his return to the United States in 1789 Jefferson had backed away from a leadership position on slavery. The ringing denunciations of slavery presented in Notes had generated controversy, especially within the planter class of Virginia, and Jefferson’s deep aversion to controversy made him withdraw from the cutting edge of the antislavery movement once he experienced the sharp feelings it aroused. Moreover, the very logic of his argument in Notes exposed the inherent intractability of his position. Although he believed that slavery was a gross violation of the principles celebrated in the Declaration of Independence, he also believed that people of African descent were biologically inferior to whites and could never live alongside whites in peace and harmony. They would have to be transported elsewhere, back to Africa or perhaps the Caribbean, after emancipation. Because such a massive deportation was a logistical and economic impossibility, the unavoidable conclusion was that, though slavery was wrong, ending it, at least at present, was inconceivable. That became Jefferson’s public position throughout the remainder of his life. It also shaped his personal posture as a slave owner. Jefferson owned, on average, about 200 slaves at any point in time, and slightly over 600 over his lifetime. To protect himself from facing the reality of his problematic status as plantation master, he constructed a paternalistic self-image as a benevolent father caring for what he called “my family.” Believing that he and his slaves were the victims of history’s failure to proceed along the  Thomas Jefferson   Peale, Charles Willson: portrait of Thomas Jefferson enlightened path, he saw himself as the steward for those entrusted to his care until a better future arrived for them all. In the meantime, his own lavish lifestyle and all the incessant and expensive renovations of his Monticello mansion were wholly dependent on slave labour. Whatever silent thoughts he might have harboured about freeing his slaves never found their way into the record. (He freed only five slaves, all members of the Hemings family.) His mounting indebtedness rendered all such thoughts superfluous toward the end, because his slaves, like all his possessions, were mortgaged to his creditors and therefore not really his to free. Party politics Jefferson returned to the United States in 1789 to serve as the first secretary of state under President George Washington. He was entering the most uncharted waters in American history. There had never been an enduring republican government in a nation as large as the United States, and no one was sure if it was possible or how it would work. The Constitution ratified in 1788 was still a work-in- progress, less a blueprint that provided answers than a framework for arguing about the salient questions. And because Jefferson had been serving in France when the constitutional battles of 1787–88 were waged in Philadelphia and then in the state ratifying conventions, he entered the volatile debates of the 1790s without a clear track record of his constitutional convictions. In truth, unlike his friend and disciple James Madison, Jefferson did not think primarily in constitutional categories. His major concern about the new Constitution was the absence of any bill of rights. He was less interested in defining the powers of government than in identifying those regions where government could not intrude (see primary source documents: On the New Constitution and On the Omission of a Bill of Rights). During his tenure as secretary of state (1790–93), foreign policy was his chief responsibility. Within the cabinet a three-pronged division soon emerged over American policy toward the European powers. While all parties embraced some version of the neutrality doctrine, the specific choices posed by the ongoing competition for supremacy in Europe between England and France produced a bitter conflict. Washington and Adams, who was serving as vice president, insisted on complete neutrality, which in practice meant tacking back and forth between the two dominant world powers of the moment. Alexander Hamilton pushed for a pro-English version of neutrality—chiefly commercial ties with the  Thomas Jefferson   most potent mercantile power in the world. Jefferson favoured a pro-French version of neutrality, arguing that the Franco-American treaty of 1778 obliged the United States to honour past French support during the war for independence, and that the French Revolution embodied the “spirit of ’76” on European soil. Even when the French Revolution spun out of control and began to devour its own partisans, Jefferson insisted that these bloody convulsions were only temporary excesses justified by the larger ideological issues at stake. This remained his unwavering position throughout the decade. Even after he retired from office late in 1793, he issued directives from Monticello opposing the Neutrality Act (1793) and the Jay Treaty (1795) as pacts with the British harlot and betrayals of our French brethren. Serving as vice president during the Adams presidency (1797–1801), Jefferson worked behind the scenes to undermine Adams’s efforts to sustain strict neutrality and blamed the outbreak of the “quasi-war” with France in 1797–98 on what he called “our American Anglophiles” rather than the French Directory. His foreign-policy vision was resolutely moralistic and highly ideological, dominated by a dichotomous view of England as a corrupt and degenerate engine of despotism and France as the enlightened wave of the future. Jefferson’s position on domestic policy during the 1790s was a variation on the same ideological dichotomy. As Hamilton began to construct his extensive financial program—to include funding the national debt, assuming the state debts, and creating a national bank— Jefferson came to regard the consolidation of power at the federal level as a diabolical plot to subvert the true meaning of the American Revolution. As Jefferson saw it, the entire Federalist commitment to an energetic central government with broad powers over the domestic economy replicated the arbitrary policies of Parliament and George III, which the American Revolution had supposedly repudiated as monarchical and aristocratic practices, incompatible with the principles of republicanism. Jefferson sincerely believed that the “principles of ’76” were being betrayed by a Federalist version of the “court party,” whose covert scheme was to install monarchy and a pseudo-aristocracy of bankers and “monocrats” to rule over the American yeomanry. All the major events of the decade—the creation of a national bank, the debate over the location of a national capital, the suppression of the Whiskey Rebellion in western Pennsylvania, the passage of the Jay Treaty, and, most notoriously, the enforcement of the Alien and Sedition Acts—were viewed through this ideological lens. By the middle years of the decade two distinctive political camps had emerged, calling themselves Federalists  Thomas Jefferson   and Republicans (later Democratic-Republicans). Not that modern-day political parties, with their mechanisms for raising money, selecting candidates, and waging election campaigns, were fully formed at this stage. (Full-blooded political parties date from the 1830s and ’40s.) But an embryonic version of the party structure was congealing, and Jefferson, assisted and advised by Madison, established the rudiments of the first opposition party in American politics under the Republican banner. The partnership between Jefferson and Madison, labeled by subsequent historians as “the great collaboration,” deserves special attention. John Quincy Adams put it nicely when he observed that “the mutual influence of these two mighty minds on each other is a phenomenon, like the invisible and mysterious movements of the magnet in the physical world.” Because the notion of a legitimate opposition to the elected government did not yet exist, and because the term party remained an epithet that was synonymous with faction, meaning an organized effort to undermine the public interest, Jefferson and Madison were labeled as traitors by the Federalist press. They were, in effect, inventing a modern form of political behaviour before there was any neutral vocabulary for talking about it. Jefferson’s own capacity to live comfortably with contradictions served him well in this context, since he was creating and leading a political party while insisting that parties were evil agents. In 1796 he ran for the presidency against Adams, all the while claiming not to know that he was even a candidate. Most negative assessments of Jefferson’s character date from this period, especially the charge of hypocrisy and duplicity. The highly combustible political culture of the early republic reached a crescendo in the election of 1800, one of the most fiercely contested campaigns in American history. (See primary source document: Jefferson and Liberty.) The Federalist press described Jefferson as a pagan and atheist, a treasonable conspirator against the duly elected administrations of Washington and Adams, a utopian dreamer with anarchistic tendencies toward the role of government, and a cunning behind-the-scenes manipulator of Republican propaganda. All these charges were gross exaggerations, save the last. Always operating through intermediaries, Jefferson paid several journalists to libel Adams, his old friend but current political enemy, and offered the vice presidency to Aaron Burr in return for delivering the electoral votes of New York. In the final tally the 12 New York votes made the difference, with the tandem of Jefferson and Burr winning 73 to 65. A quirk in the Constitution, subsequently corrected in the Twelfth Amendment, prevented electors from distinguishing between their choice of president and vice president, so Jefferson and Burr tied for the top spot, even though voter preference for Jefferson was incontestable. The decision was  Thomas Jefferson   thrown into the House of Representatives where, after several weeks of debate and backroom wheeling and dealing, Jefferson was elected on the 36th ballot. Presidency There was a good deal of nervous speculation whether the new American nation could survive a Jefferson presidency. The entire thrust of Jefferson’s political position throughout the 1790s had been defiantly negative, rejecting as excessive the powers vested in the national government by the Federalists. In his Virginia Resolutions of 1798, written in protest of the Alien and Sedition Acts, he had described any projection of federal authority over the domestic policy of the states as a violation of “the spirit of ’76” and therefore a justification for secession from the Union. (This became the position of the Confederacy in 1861.) His Federalist critics wondered how he could take an oath to preserve, protect, and defend the Constitution of the United States if his primary goal as president was to dismantle the federal institutions created by that very document. As he rose to deliver his inaugural address on March 4, 1801, in the still-unfinished Capitol of the equally unfinished national capital on the Potomac, the mood was apprehensive. The most rabid alarmists had already been proved wrong, since the first transfer of power from one political regime to another had occurred peacefully, even routinely. But it was still very much an open question whether, as Lincoln later put it, “any nation so conceived and so dedicated could long endure” in the absence of a central government along Federalist lines. The major message of Jefferson’s inaugural address was conciliatory. Its most famous line (“We are all republicans—we are all federalists”) suggested that the scatological party battles of the previous decade must cease. He described his election as a recovery of the original intentions of the American Revolution, this after the hostile takeover of those “ancient and sacred truths” by the Federalists, who had erroneously assumed that a stable American nation required a powerful central government. In Jefferson’s truly distinctive and original formulation, the coherence of the American republic did not require the mechanisms of a powerful state to survive or flourish. Indeed, the health of the emerging American nation was inversely proportional to the power of the federal government, for in the end the sovereign source of republican government was voluntary popular opinion, “the people,” and the latent energies these liberated individuals released when unburdened by government restrictions. In 1804 Jefferson was easily reelected over Federalist Charles Cotesworth Pinckney, winning 162 electoral votes to Pinckney’s 14. Initially, at least, his policies as president reflected his desire for decentralization, which meant dismantling the embryonic federal  Thomas Jefferson   government, the army and navy, and all federal taxation programs, as well as placing the national debt, which stood at $112 million, on the road to extinction. These reforms enjoyed considerable success for two reasons. First, the temporary cessation of the war between England and France for European supremacy permitted American merchants to trade with both sides and produced unprecedented national prosperity. Second, in selecting Albert Gallatin as secretary of the Treasury, Jefferson placed one of the most capable managers of fiscal policy in the most strategic location. Gallatin, a Swiss-born prodigy with impeccable Republican credentials, dominated the cabinet discussions alongside Madison, the ever-loyal Jefferson disciple who served as secretary of state. Actually there were very few cabinet discussions because Jefferson preferred to do the bulk of business within the executive branch in writing. Crafting language on the page was his most obvious talent, and he required all cabinet officers to submit drafts of their recommendations, which he then edited and returned for their comments. The same textual approach applied to his dealings with Congress. All of his annual messages were delivered in writing rather than in person. Indeed, apart from his two inaugural addresses (see primary source documents: First Inaugural Address and Second Inaugural Address), there is no record of Jefferson delivering any public speeches whatsoever. In part this was a function of his notoriously inadequate abilities as an orator, but it also reflected his desire to make the office of the presidency almost invisible. His one gesture at visibility was to schedule weekly dinners when Congress was in session, which became famous for the quality of the wine, the pell-mell seating arrangements, and informal approach to etiquette —a clear defiance of European-style decorum. The major achievement of his first term was also an act of defiance, though this time it involved defying his own principles. In 1803 Napoleon decided to consolidate his resources for a new round of the conflict with England by selling the vast Louisiana region, which stretched from the Mississippi Valley to the Rocky Mountains. Although the asking price, $15 million, was a stupendous bargain, assuming the cost meant substantially increasing the national debt. More significantly, what became known as the Louisiana Purchase violated Jefferson’s constitutional scruples. Indeed, many historians regard it as the boldest executive action in American history. But Jefferson never wavered, reasoning that the opportunity to double the national domain was too good to miss. The American West always triggered Jefferson’s most visionary energies, seeing it, as he did, as America’s future, the place where the simple republican principles could be constantly renewed. In one fell swoop he removed the threat of a major European power from America’s borders and extended the life span of the uncluttered agrarian values he so cherished. Even before  Thomas Jefferson   news that the purchase was approved reached the United States in July 1803, Jefferson dispatched his private secretary, Meriwether Lewis, to lead an expedition to explore the new acquisition and the lands beyond, all the way to the Pacific. If the Louisiana Purchase was the crowning achievement of Jefferson’s presidency, it also proved to be the high point from which events moved steadily in the other direction. Although the Federalist Party was dead as a national force, pockets of Federalist opposition still survived, especially in New England. Despite his eloquent testimonials to the need for a free press, Jefferson was outraged by the persistent attacks on his policies and character from those quarters, and he instructed the attorneys general in the recalcitrant states to seek indictments, in clear violation of his principled commitment to freedom of expression (see primary source document: On Misreporting by the Press). He was equally heavy-handed in his treatment of Aaron Burr, who was tried for treason after leading a mysterious expedition into the American Southwest allegedly designed to detach that region from the United States with Burr crowned as its benevolent dictator. The charges were never proved, but Jefferson demanded Burr’s conviction despite the lack of evidence. He was overruled in the end by Chief Justice John Marshall, who sat as the judge in the trial. But Jefferson’s major disappointment had its origins in Europe with the resumption of the Napoleonic Wars, which resulted in naval blockades in the Atlantic and Caribbean that severely curtailed American trade and pressured the U.S. government to take sides in the conflict. Jefferson’s response was the Embargo Act (1807), which essentially closed American ports to all foreign imports and American exports. The embargo assumed that the loss of American trade would force England and France to alter their policies, but this fond hope was always an illusion, since the embryonic American economy lacked the size to generate such influence and was itself wrecked by Jefferson’s action. Moreover, the enforcement of the Embargo Act required the exercise of precisely those coercive powers by the federal government that Jefferson had previously opposed. By the time he left office in March 1809, Jefferson was a tired and beaten man, anxious to escape the consequences of his futile efforts to preserve American neutrality and eager to embrace the two-term precedent established by Washington. Retirement During the last 17 years of his life Jefferson maintained a crowded and active schedule. He rose with the dawn each day, bathed his feet in cold water, then spent the morning on his correspondence (one year he counted writing 1,268 letters) and working in his garden. Each afternoon he took a two-hour ride around his grounds. Dinner, served in the late  Thomas Jefferson   Rembrandt Peale: portrait of Thomas Jefferson afternoon, was usually an occasion to gather his daughter Martha and her 12 children, along with the inevitable visitors. Monticello became a veritable hotel during these years, on occasion housing 50 guests. The lack of privacy caused Jefferson to build a separate house on his Bedford estate about 90 miles (140 km) from Monticello, where he periodically fled for seclusion. Three architectural projects claimed a considerable share of his attention. Throughout his life Monticello remained a work-in-progress that had the appearance of a construction site. Even during his retirement years, Jefferson’s intensive efforts at completing the renovations never quite produced the masterpiece of neoclassical design he wanted to achieve and that modern-day visitors to Monticello find so compelling. A smaller but more architecturally distinctive mansion at Bedford, called Poplar Forest, was completed on schedule. It too embodied neoclassical principles but was shaped as a perfect octagon. Finally there was the campus of the University of Virginia at Charlottesville, which Jefferson called his “academical village.” Jefferson surveyed the site, which he could view in the distance from his mountaintop, and chose the Pantheon of Rome as the model for the rotunda, the centrepiece flanked by two rows of living quarters for students and faculty. In 1976 the American Institute of Architects voted it “the proudest achievement of American architecture in the past 200 years.” Even the “interior” design of the University of Virginia embodied Jeffersonian principles, in that he selected all the books for the library, defined the curriculum, picked the faculty, and chaired the Board of Visitors. Unlike every other American college at the time, “Mr. Jefferson’s university” had no religious affiliation and imposed no religious requirement on its students. As befitted an institution shaped by a believer in wholly voluntary and consensual networks of governance, there were no curricular requirements, no mandatory code of conduct except the self-enforced honour system, no president or administration. Every aspect of life at the University of Virginia reflected Jefferson’s belief that the only legitimate form of governance was self-governance. In 1812 his vast correspondence began to include an exchange with his former friend and more recent rival John Adams. The reconciliation between the two patriarchs was arranged by their mutual friend Benjamin Rush, who described them as “the North and South poles  Thomas Jefferson   of the American Revolution.” That description suggested more than merely geographic symbolism, since Adams and Jefferson effectively, even dramatically, embodied the twin impulses of the revolutionary generation. As the “Sage of Monticello,” Jefferson represented the Revolution as a clean break with the past, the rejection of all European versions of political discipline as feudal vestiges, the ingrained hostility toward all mechanisms of governmental authority that originated in faraway places. As the “Sage of Quincy (Massachusetts),” Adams resembled an American version of Edmund Burke, which meant that he attributed the success of the American Revolution to its linkage with past practices, most especially the tradition of representative government established in the colonial assemblies. He regarded the constitutional settlement of 1787–88 as a shrewd compromise with the political necessities of a nation-state exercising jurisdiction over an extensive, eventually continental, empire, not as a betrayal of the American Revolution but an evolutionary fulfillment of its promise. These genuine differences of opinion made Adams and Jefferson the odd couple of the American Revolution and were the primary reasons why they had drifted to different sides of the divide during the party wars of the 1790s. The exchange of 158 letters between 1812 and 1826 permitted the two sages to pose as philosopher-kings and create what is arguably the most intellectually impressive correspondence between statesmen in all of American history. Beyond the elegiac tone and almost sculpted serenity of the letters, the correspondence exposed the fundamental contradictions that the American Revolution managed to contain. As Adams so poignantly put it, “You and I ought not to die before we have explained ourselves to each other.” And because of Adams’s incessant prodding, Jefferson was frequently forced to clarify his mature position on the most salient issues of the era. One issue that even Adams and Jefferson could not discuss candidly was slavery. Jefferson’s mature position on that forbidden subject represented a further retreat from any leadership role in ending the “peculiar institution.” In 1819, during the debate in Congress over the Missouri Compromise, he endorsed the expansion of slavery into all the western territories, precisely the opposite of the position he had taken in the 1780s. Though he continued to insist that slavery was a massive anomaly, he insisted even more strongly that it was wrong for the federal government to attempt any effort at emancipation. In fact he described any federal intrusion in the matter as a despotic act analogous to George III’s imperial interference in colonial affairs or Hamilton’s corrupt scheme to establish a disguised form of monarchy in the early republic. His letters to fellow Virginians during his  Thomas Jefferson   last years reflect a conspiratorial mentality toward the national government and a clear preference for secession if threatened with any mandatory plan for abolition. Apart from slavery, the other shadow that darkened Monticello during Jefferson’s twilight years was debt. Jefferson was chronically in debt throughout most of his life, in part because of obligations inherited from his father-in-law in his wife’s dowry, mostly because of his own lavish lifestyle, which never came to terms with the proverbial bottom line despite careful entries in his account books that provided him with only the illusion of control. In truth, by the 1820s the interest on his debt was compounding at a faster rate than any repayment schedule could meet. By the end, he was more than $100,000—in modern terms several million dollars—in debt. An exception was made in Virginia law to permit a lottery that Jefferson hoped would allow his heirs to retain at least a portion of his property. But the massiveness of his debt overwhelmed all such hopes. Monticello, including land, mansion, furnishings, and the vast bulk of the slave population, was auctioned off the year after his death, and his surviving daughter, Martha, was forced to accept charitable contributions to sustain her family. Before that ignominious end, which Jefferson never lived to see, he managed to sound one last triumphant note that projected his most enduring and attractive message to posterity. In late June 1826 Jefferson was asked to join the Independence Day celebrations in Washington, D.C., on the 50th anniversary of the defining event in his and the nation’s life. He declined, explaining that he was in no condition to leave his mountaintop. But he mustered up one final surge of energy to draft a statement that would be read in his absence at the ceremony. He clearly intended it as his final testament. Though some of the language, like the language of the Declaration itself, was borrowed from others, here was the vintage Jeffersonian vision: May it be to the world, what I believe it will be, (to some parts sooner, to others later, but finally to all,) the signal of arousing men to burst the chains under which monkish ignorance and superstition had persuaded them to bind themselves, and to assume the blessings and security of self-government.… All eyes are opened or opening to the rights of men. The general spread of the light of science has already laid open to every view the palpable truth, that the mass of mankind has not been born with saddles on their backs, nor a favored few, booted and spurred, ready to ride them legitimately by the grace of God. These are grounds of hope for others; for ourselves, let the annual return of this day forever refresh our recollections of these rights, and an undiminished devotion to them. Even as these words were being read in Washington, Jefferson went to his maker in his bed at Monticello at about half past noon on July 4, 1826. His last conscious words, uttered the  Thomas Jefferson   preceding evening, were “Is it the Fourth?” Always a man given to Herculean feats of self- control, he somehow managed to time his own death to coincide with history. More remarkably, up in Quincy on that same day his old rival and friend also managed to die on schedule. John Adams passed away later in the afternoon. His last words—“Thomas Jefferson still lives”—were wrong at the moment but right for the future, since Jefferson’s complex legacy was destined to become the most resonant and controversial touchstone in all of American history.

Thomas Mapfumo
Thomas Mapfumo, (born 1945, Marondera,
Southern Rhodesia [now in Zimbabwe]),
Zimbabwean musician and composer who propelled
Zimbabwe toward independence in the 1970s through
his cultivation of chimurenga—a local genre of
politically charged popular music. Mapfumo also was
instrumental in introducing the West to the traditional
music of Zimbabwe through his involvement in the world music movement.
When he was still a child, Mapfumo moved from Marondera to Salisbury (now Harare),
where he began his musical career at age 16 with a band called the Cyclones. His early
career with such bands as the Springfields and the Cosmic Dots featured little more than a
few cover versions of Elvis Presley and Otis Redding tunes. During the early 1970s,
however, when many black Zimbabweans were beginning to resist the white minority
government, Mapfumo was also effecting a revolution in popular music by writing the
lyrics to his songs in the language of the Shona people, who constitute the majority of
black Zimbabweans, and by incorporating traditional melodies and rhythms into his music.
One of the key inspirations of Mapfumo’s work was the music of the mbira, an African
lamellaphone consisting of a large gourd resonator fitted with a set of metal keys that are
plucked with the thumbs. Mapfumo and his guitarist worked together to duplicate on the
electric guitar the sounds and rhythms of the mbira. The intensely complicated rhythms
played on the drums were meant to represent the stamping of dancers’ feet. In 1976
Mapfumo formed the Acid Band, which produced a blend of popular and traditional music
as a vehicle to carry thinly veiled political messages; that music was called chimurenga
(Shona: “struggle”). The band’s first album, released in 1977, was titled Hokoyo! (“Watch
Out!”).
The white minority government saw Mapfumo’s music as a threat and banned it from the
state-controlled radio stations. His music was still heard, however, in discos and on radio
broadcasts that originated in neighbouring countries. In late 1977, with the escalation of
guerrilla warfare, security forces finally attempted to silence Mapfumo by imprisoning him
for 90 days. Upon his release he returned to writing his chimurenga songs, which had come
to be identified with the fight for freedom. In 1978 he founded the band with which he
would continue to perform (albeit with changes in personnel) into the 21st century, the

Blacks Unlimited. When Zimbabwe won independence in 1980, Mapfumo was considered
to have played no small part in the achievement. During the 1980s he added a real mbira to
the band and continued to nurture and promote the traditional music of Zimbabwe.
Even after independence, Mapfumo’s music maintained a sociopolitical edge. As he lost
faith in Pres. Robert Mugabe in the later 20th century, the government increasingly became
the target of his criticism, and, following the release of Corruption (1989) with the Blacks
Unlimited, Mapfumo and the members of his band were subject to harassment by the
administration. In his 1993 album, Hondo (“War”), Mapfumo’s Shona lyrics still spoke of
struggle—against war, the AIDS epidemic in Africa, and the loss of traditional culture. By
the mid-1990s Mapfumo had become firmly established in the increasingly popular realm
of world music and had garnered more international recognition for the sounds of his
country than any other Zimbabwean musician to date.
Viewed in his own country not only as a brilliant musician but also as an important
revolutionary and powerful advocate of social justice, Mapfumo indeed found himself in
continual conflict with the government. This political friction eventually led him in 2000 to
move to the United States, where he settled in Oregon. Mapfumo’s relocation did not
diminish the potency of his recordings in his homeland, however; his 2005 album, Rise Up,
like many of his earlier works, was banned from the state radio stations of Zimbabwe. Exile
(2010) and Danger Zone (2015) were equally politically pointed. Following Mugabe’s
2017 resignation, Mapfumo returned to Zimbabwe for the first time since 2004 to perform
in concert in Harare, on April 28, 2018, before an audience of thousands.

The intensely complicated rhythms played on the drums were meant to represent the stamping of dancers’ feet.

Thomas Paine
Thomas Paine, (born January 29, 1737, Thetford,
Norfolk, England—died June 8, 1809, New York,
New York, U.S.), English-American writer and
political pamphleteer whose Common Sense pamphlet
and Crisis papers were important influences on the
American Revolution. Other works that contributed to
his reputation as one of the greatest political
propagandists in history were Rights of Man, a defense of the French Revolution and of
republican principles, and The Age of Reason, an exposition of the place of religion in
society.
Life in England and America
Paine was born of a Quaker father and an Anglican mother. His formal education was
meagre, just enough to enable him to master reading, writing, and arithmetic. At 13 he
began work with his father as a corset maker and then tried various other occupations
unsuccessfully, finally becoming an officer of the excise. His duties were to hunt for
smugglers and collect the excise taxes on liquor and tobacco. The pay was insufficient to
cover living costs, but he used part of his earnings to purchase books and scientific
apparatus.
Paine’s life in England was marked by repeated failures. He had two brief marriages. He
was unsuccessful or unhappy in every job he tried. He was dismissed from the excise office
after he published a strong argument in 1772 for a raise in pay as the only way to end
corruption in the service. Just when his situation appeared hopeless, he met Benjamin
Franklin in London, who advised him to seek his fortune in America and gave him letters
of introduction (including one to Franklin’s son-in-law, Richard Bache).
Paine arrived in Philadelphia on November 30, 1774. Bache introduced him to Robert
Aitkin, whose Pennsylvania Magazine Paine helped found and edit for 18 months. In
addition Paine published numerous articles and some poetry, anonymously or under
pseudonyms. One such article was “African Slavery in America,” a scathing denunciation
of the African slave trade, which he signed “Justice and Humanity.”
Paine had arrived in America when the conflict between the colonists and England was
reaching its height. After blood was spilled at the Battles of Lexington and Concord, April

Common Sense
19, 1775, Paine argued that the cause of America
should be not just a revolt against taxation but a
demand for independence. He put this idea into
Common Sense, which came off the press on January
10, 1776. The 50-page pamphlet sold more than
500,000 copies within a few months. More than any
other single publication, Common Sense paved the
way for the Declaration of Independence, unanimously ratified on July 4, 1776.
During the war that followed, Paine served as volunteer aide-de-camp to Gen. Nathanael
Greene. His great contribution to the patriot cause was the 16 “Crisis” papers issued
between 1776 and 1783, each one signed Common Sense. “The American Crisis. Number
I,” published on December 19, 1776, when George Washington’s army was on the verge of
disintegration, so moved Washington that he ordered it read to all the troops at Valley
Forge. Its opening is among the most stirring passages in the literature of the American
Revolution:
These are the times that try men’s souls. The summer soldier and the sunshine patriot will, in
this crisis, shrink from the service of his country; but he that stands it now deserves the love and
thanks of man and woman. Tyranny, like hell, is not easily conquered; yet we have this
consolation with us—that the harder the conflict, the more glorious the triumph. What we obtain
too cheap, we esteem too lightly: It is dearness only that gives everything its value. Heaven
knows how to put a proper price upon its goods; and it would be strange indeed if so celestial an
article as freedom should not be highly rated. Britain, with an army to enforce her tyranny, has
declared that she has a right not only to tax but “to bind us in all cases whatsoever,” and if being
bound in that manner is not slavery, then is there not such a thing as slavery upon earth. Even
the expression is impious, for so unlimited a power can belong only to God.
This paper, combined with the subsequent victory of Washington’s army in the Battle of
Trenton later in the month, had the probable effect of inspiring many soldiers, whose term
of service would expire January 1, to reenlist.
In 1777 Congress appointed Paine secretary to the Committee for Foreign Affairs. He held
the post until early in 1779, when he became involved in a controversy with Silas Deane, a
member of the Continental Congress, whom Paine accused of seeking to profit personally
from French aid to the United States. But in revealing Deane’s machinations, Paine was
forced to quote from secret documents to which he had access as secretary of the
Committee for Foreign Affairs. As a result, despite the truth of his accusations, he was
forced to resign his post.

Paine’s desperate need of employment was relieved when he was appointed clerk of the
General Assembly of Pennsylvania on November 2, 1779. In this capacity he had frequent
opportunity to observe that American troops were at the end of their patience because of
lack of pay and scarcity of supplies. Paine took $500 from his salary and started a
subscription for the relief of the soldiers. In 1781, pursuing the same goal, he accompanied
John Laurens to France. The money, clothing, and ammunition they brought back with
them were important to the final success of the Revolution. Paine also appealed to the
separate states to cooperate for the well-being of the entire nation. In “Public Good” (1780)
he included a call for a national convention to remedy the ineffectual Articles of
Confederation and establish a strong central government under “a continental constitution.”
At the end of the American Revolution, Paine again found himself poverty-stricken. His
patriotic writings had sold by the hundreds of thousands, but he had refused to accept any
profits in order that cheap editions might be widely circulated. In a petition to Congress
endorsed by Washington, he pleaded for financial assistance. It was buried by Paine’s
opponents in Congress, but Pennsylvania gave him £500 and New York a farm in New
Rochelle. Here Paine devoted his time to inventions, concentrating on an iron bridge
without piers and a smokeless candle.
In Europe: Rights of Man
In April 1787 Paine left for Europe to promote his plan to build a single-arch bridge across
the wide Schuylkill River near Philadelphia. But in England he was soon diverted from his
engineering project. In December 1789 he published anonymously a warning against the
attempt of Prime Minister William Pitt to involve England in a war with France over the
Dutch Republic, reminding the British people that war had “but one thing certain and that
is increase of taxes.” But it was the French Revolution that now filled Paine’s thoughts. He
was enraged by Edmund Burke’s attack on the uprising of the French people in his
Reflections on the Revolution in France, and, though Paine admired Burke’s stand in
favour of the American Revolution, he rushed into print with his celebrated answer, Rights
of Man (March 13, 1791). The book immediately created a sensation. At least eight editions
were published in 1791, and the work was quickly reprinted in the U.S., where it was
widely distributed by the Jeffersonian societies. When Burke replied, Paine came back with
Rights of Man, Part II, published on February 17, 1792.
What began as a defense of the French Revolution evolved into an analysis of the basic
reasons for discontent in European society and a remedy for the evils of arbitrary
government, poverty, illiteracy, unemployment, and war. Paine spoke out effectively in

favour of republicanism as against monarchy and went on to outline a plan for popular
education, relief of the poor, pensions for aged people, and public works for the
unemployed, all to be financed by the levying of a progressive income tax. To the ruling
class Paine’s proposals spelled “bloody revolution,” and the government ordered the book
banned and the publisher jailed. Paine himself was indicted for treason, and an order went
out for his arrest. But he was en route to France, having been elected to a seat in the
National Convention, before the order for his arrest could be delivered. Paine was tried in
absentia, found guilty of seditious libel, and declared an outlaw, and Rights of Man was
ordered permanently suppressed.
The first years that he spent in France formed a curious episode in his life. He was
enthusiastically received, but, because he knew little French, translations of his speeches
had to be read for him. In France Paine hailed the abolition of the monarchy but deplored
the terror against the royalists and fought unsuccessfully to save the life of King Louis
XVI, favouring banishment rather than execution, which he argued would alienate
American sympathy. He was to pay for his efforts to save the king’s life when the radicals
under Maximilien Robespierre took power. Paine was imprisoned from December 28,
1793, to November 4, 1794, when, with the fall of Robespierre, he was released and,
though seriously ill, readmitted to the National Convention.
While in prison, the first part of Paine’s Age of Reason was published (1794), and it was
followed by Part II after his release (1796). Although Paine made it clear that he believed
in a Supreme Being and, as a Deist, opposed only organized religion, the work won him a
reputation as an atheist among the orthodox. The publication of his last great pamphlet,
Agrarian Justice (1797), with its attack on inequalities in property ownership, added to his
many enemies in establishment circles.
Paine remained in France until September 1, 1802, when he sailed for the United States. He
quickly discovered that his services to the country had been all but forgotten and that he
was widely regarded only as the world’s greatest infidel. Despite his poverty and his
physical condition, worsened by occasional drunkenness, Paine continued his attacks on
privilege and religious superstitions. He died in New York City in 1809 and was buried in
New Rochelle on the farm given to him by the state of New York as a reward for his
Revolutionary writings. Ten years later, William Cobbett, the political journalist, exhumed
the bones and took them to England, where he hoped to give Paine a funeral worthy of his
great contributions to humanity. But the plan backfired, and the bones were lost, never to
be recovered.

Legacy
At Paine’s death most U.S. newspapers reprinted the
obituary notice from the New York Citizen, which
read in part: “He had lived long, did some good and
much harm.” This remained the verdict of history for
more than a century following his death, but the tide
has turned: on January 30, 1937, The Times of
London referred to him as “the English Voltaire,” and
on May 18, 1952, Paine’s bust was placed in the New York University Hall of Fame.

Foner']","Thomas Paine Thomas Paine, (born January 29, 1737, Thetford, Norfolk, England—died June 8, 1809, New York, New York, U.S.), English-American writer and political pamphleteer whose Common Sense pamphlet and Crisis papers were important influences on the American Revolution. Other works that contributed to his reputation as one of the greatest political propagandists in history were Rights of Man, a defense of the French Revolution and of republican principles, and The Age of Reason, an exposition of the place of religion in society. Life in England and America Paine was born of a Quaker father and an Anglican mother. His formal education was meagre, just enough to enable him to master reading, writing, and arithmetic. At 13 he began work with his father as a corset maker and then tried various other occupations unsuccessfully, finally becoming an officer of the excise. His duties were to hunt for smugglers and collect the excise taxes on liquor and tobacco. The pay was insufficient to cover living costs, but he used part of his earnings to purchase books and scientific apparatus. Paine’s life in England was marked by repeated failures. He had two brief marriages. He was unsuccessful or unhappy in every job he tried. He was dismissed from the excise office after he published a strong argument in 1772 for a raise in pay as the only way to end corruption in the service. Just when his situation appeared hopeless, he met Benjamin Franklin in London, who advised him to seek his fortune in America and gave him letters of introduction (including one to Franklin’s son-in-law, Richard Bache). Paine arrived in Philadelphia on November 30, 1774. Bache introduced him to Robert Aitkin, whose Pennsylvania Magazine Paine helped found and edit for 18 months. In addition Paine published numerous articles and some poetry, anonymously or under pseudonyms. One such article was “African Slavery in America,” a scathing denunciation of the African slave trade, which he signed “Justice and Humanity.” Paine had arrived in America when the conflict between the colonists and England was reaching its height. After blood was spilled at the Battles of Lexington and Concord, April  Thomas Paine   Common Sense 19, 1775, Paine argued that the cause of America should be not just a revolt against taxation but a demand for independence. He put this idea into Common Sense, which came off the press on January 10, 1776. The 50-page pamphlet sold more than 500,000 copies within a few months. More than any other single publication, Common Sense paved the way for the Declaration of Independence, unanimously ratified on July 4, 1776. During the war that followed, Paine served as volunteer aide-de-camp to Gen. Nathanael Greene. His great contribution to the patriot cause was the 16 “Crisis” papers issued between 1776 and 1783, each one signed Common Sense. “The American Crisis. Number I,” published on December 19, 1776, when George Washington’s army was on the verge of disintegration, so moved Washington that he ordered it read to all the troops at Valley Forge. Its opening is among the most stirring passages in the literature of the American Revolution: These are the times that try men’s souls. The summer soldier and the sunshine patriot will, in this crisis, shrink from the service of his country; but he that stands it now deserves the love and thanks of man and woman. Tyranny, like hell, is not easily conquered; yet we have this consolation with us—that the harder the conflict, the more glorious the triumph. What we obtain too cheap, we esteem too lightly: It is dearness only that gives everything its value. Heaven knows how to put a proper price upon its goods; and it would be strange indeed if so celestial an article as freedom should not be highly rated. Britain, with an army to enforce her tyranny, has declared that she has a right not only to tax but “to bind us in all cases whatsoever,” and if being bound in that manner is not slavery, then is there not such a thing as slavery upon earth. Even the expression is impious, for so unlimited a power can belong only to God. This paper, combined with the subsequent victory of Washington’s army in the Battle of Trenton later in the month, had the probable effect of inspiring many soldiers, whose term of service would expire January 1, to reenlist. In 1777 Congress appointed Paine secretary to the Committee for Foreign Affairs. He held the post until early in 1779, when he became involved in a controversy with Silas Deane, a member of the Continental Congress, whom Paine accused of seeking to profit personally from French aid to the United States. But in revealing Deane’s machinations, Paine was forced to quote from secret documents to which he had access as secretary of the Committee for Foreign Affairs. As a result, despite the truth of his accusations, he was forced to resign his post. Thomas Paine   Paine’s desperate need of employment was relieved when he was appointed clerk of the General Assembly of Pennsylvania on November 2, 1779. In this capacity he had frequent opportunity to observe that American troops were at the end of their patience because of lack of pay and scarcity of supplies. Paine took $500 from his salary and started a subscription for the relief of the soldiers. In 1781, pursuing the same goal, he accompanied John Laurens to France. The money, clothing, and ammunition they brought back with them were important to the final success of the Revolution. Paine also appealed to the separate states to cooperate for the well-being of the entire nation. In “Public Good” (1780) he included a call for a national convention to remedy the ineffectual Articles of Confederation and establish a strong central government under “a continental constitution.” At the end of the American Revolution, Paine again found himself poverty-stricken. His patriotic writings had sold by the hundreds of thousands, but he had refused to accept any profits in order that cheap editions might be widely circulated. In a petition to Congress endorsed by Washington, he pleaded for financial assistance. It was buried by Paine’s opponents in Congress, but Pennsylvania gave him £500 and New York a farm in New Rochelle. Here Paine devoted his time to inventions, concentrating on an iron bridge without piers and a smokeless candle. In Europe: Rights of Man In April 1787 Paine left for Europe to promote his plan to build a single-arch bridge across the wide Schuylkill River near Philadelphia. But in England he was soon diverted from his engineering project. In December 1789 he published anonymously a warning against the attempt of Prime Minister William Pitt to involve England in a war with France over the Dutch Republic, reminding the British people that war had “but one thing certain and that is increase of taxes.” But it was the French Revolution that now filled Paine’s thoughts. He was enraged by Edmund Burke’s attack on the uprising of the French people in his Reflections on the Revolution in France, and, though Paine admired Burke’s stand in favour of the American Revolution, he rushed into print with his celebrated answer, Rights of Man (March 13, 1791). The book immediately created a sensation. At least eight editions were published in 1791, and the work was quickly reprinted in the U.S., where it was widely distributed by the Jeffersonian societies. When Burke replied, Paine came back with Rights of Man, Part II, published on February 17, 1792. What began as a defense of the French Revolution evolved into an analysis of the basic reasons for discontent in European society and a remedy for the evils of arbitrary government, poverty, illiteracy, unemployment, and war. Paine spoke out effectively in  Thomas Paine   favour of republicanism as against monarchy and went on to outline a plan for popular education, relief of the poor, pensions for aged people, and public works for the unemployed, all to be financed by the levying of a progressive income tax. To the ruling class Paine’s proposals spelled “bloody revolution,” and the government ordered the book banned and the publisher jailed. Paine himself was indicted for treason, and an order went out for his arrest. But he was en route to France, having been elected to a seat in the National Convention, before the order for his arrest could be delivered. Paine was tried in absentia, found guilty of seditious libel, and declared an outlaw, and Rights of Man was ordered permanently suppressed. The first years that he spent in France formed a curious episode in his life. He was enthusiastically received, but, because he knew little French, translations of his speeches had to be read for him. In France Paine hailed the abolition of the monarchy but deplored the terror against the royalists and fought unsuccessfully to save the life of King Louis XVI, favouring banishment rather than execution, which he argued would alienate American sympathy. He was to pay for his efforts to save the king’s life when the radicals under Maximilien Robespierre took power. Paine was imprisoned from December 28, 1793, to November 4, 1794, when, with the fall of Robespierre, he was released and, though seriously ill, readmitted to the National Convention. While in prison, the first part of Paine’s Age of Reason was published (1794), and it was followed by Part II after his release (1796). Although Paine made it clear that he believed in a Supreme Being and, as a Deist, opposed only organized religion, the work won him a reputation as an atheist among the orthodox. The publication of his last great pamphlet, Agrarian Justice (1797), with its attack on inequalities in property ownership, added to his many enemies in establishment circles. Paine remained in France until September 1, 1802, when he sailed for the United States. He quickly discovered that his services to the country had been all but forgotten and that he was widely regarded only as the world’s greatest infidel. Despite his poverty and his physical condition, worsened by occasional drunkenness, Paine continued his attacks on privilege and religious superstitions. He died in New York City in 1809 and was buried in New Rochelle on the farm given to him by the state of New York as a reward for his Revolutionary writings. Ten years later, William Cobbett, the political journalist, exhumed the bones and took them to England, where he hoped to give Paine a funeral worthy of his great contributions to humanity. But the plan backfired, and the bones were lost, never to be recovered.

Tjipto Mangunkusumo, (born 1884—died March 8, 1942, Djakarta, Java, Dutch East
Indies [now Indonesia]), early 20th-century Indonesian nationalist leader whose resistance
to Dutch colonial rule brought him exile and long imprisonment.
Tjipto Mangunkusumo was among the first Indonesian leaders to abandon the cultural
approach of most early nationalist groups, which promoted distinctly Indonesian art,
literature, and values. With E.F.E. Douwes Dekker and Suwardi Surjaningrat (later known
as Ki Hadjar Dewantoro) he founded in 1911 the socialist Indies Party (Indische Partij),
which was devoted to political action to attain independence. Two years later all three
leaders were ordered out of the Dutch East Indies, although Tjipto Mangunkusumo was
allowed to return in 1914. He resumed activity in Insulinde, the successor to the Indies
Party, backing radical action such as the peasant resistance to taxes in the Solo princely
lands. In 1918 he became a member of the Volksraad, a parliamentary body that included
Indonesians but exercised very little power. In July 1927 he helped found the Indonesian
Nationalist Party (Partai Nasional Indonesia), of which Sukarno was chairman. Shortly
thereafter, however, Tjipto Mangunkusumo was sent into exile on a prison island for
attempting to foment revolt among the Indonesians serving in the Dutch forces. He
remained in exile for 11 years.

Tom Mboya
Tom Mboya, in full Thomas Joseph Odhiambo Mboya, (born Aug. 15, 1930, Kilima
Mbogo, near Nairobi, Kenya—died July 5, 1969, Nairobi), major political leader in Kenya
until his assassination six years after his country had achieved independence.
A member of the Luo people and a graduate of mission schools, Mboya first worked as a
sanitary inspector in Nairobi and almost immediately became involved in the nascent
Kenyan trade-union movement. He was a key nationalist figure in the days of the Mau Mau
rebellion, led by the Kikuyu people against European ownership of land. From 1953 to
1963 he was general secretary of the Kenya Federation of Labour (KFL), an especially
important post since no strictly political African national organizations were allowed in
Kenya until 1960.
Although the KFL was not able to participate overtly in politics, Mboya won the 1957
legislative council elections as a workers’ candidate, becoming one of only eight elected
African members on the council. Unlike most of his colleagues, he opposed the policy of
multiracial political representation put forward by the British colonial government in the
late 1950s. He helped form the Kenya independence movement in the council and the
People’s Convention Party in Nairobi. In the critical pre-independence decade he also spent
a year at the University of Oxford and twice visited the United States. In 1959 he helped
found the African-American Students Foundation to raise money to send East African
(originally only Kenyan) university students to the United States on charter flights, thus
making it possible for many more students to study abroad.
Mboya was a founder-member of the Kenya African National Union (KANU) in 1960. He
was minister of labour in the coalition government before independence and actively
participated in the constitutional talks that led to independence in 1963. That year Jomo
Kenyatta appointed him minister of justice and constitutional affairs. From 1964 to 1969
Mboya served as minister for economic planning and development, laying the foundation
for a strong mixed economy and capitalist-oriented policies; this upset others in Kenyatta’s
administration, such as Oginga Odinga, who advocated policies of a more socialist nature.
Mboya’s assassination in 1969 shocked the nation and exacerbated tensions between the
dominant Kikuyu and other ethnic groups, especially Mboya’s own Luo.

Tomáš Masaryk
Tomáš Masaryk
Tomáš Masaryk, in full Tomáš Garrigue Masaryk,
(born March 7, 1850, near Göding, Moravia, Austrian
Empire [now Hodonín, Czech Republic]—died Sept.
14, 1937, Lány, Czech.), chief founder and first
president (1918–35) of Czechoslovakia.
Early life
Masaryk’s father was a Slovak coachman; his mother, a maid, came from a Germanized
Moravian family. Though he was trained to be a teacher, he briefly became a locksmith’s
apprentice but then entered the German Hochschule in Brno in 1865. Continuing his
studies at the University of Vienna, he obtained his doctorate in 1876. He studied for a year
in Leipzig, where he met an American student of music, Charlotte Garrigue, whom he
married in 1878. He was appointed lecturer in philosophy in Vienna in 1879, and he
became professor of philosophy in the Czech university of Prague in 1882.
Masaryk was a Neo-Kantian, but he was also strongly influenced by the English puritan
ethics and the austere teaching of the Hussites. At the same time, he showed a critical
interest in the self-contradictions of capitalism—e.g., in his first major work, a study of
suicide as a mass phenomenon of modern civilization.
Masaryk’s early works on the Czech Reformation and the Czech revival of the early 19th
century were intended to remind the Czechs of the “religious meaning” of their heritage.
His treatise on the work of the Czech historian František Palacký, who favoured equal
rights for Slavs within the Austrian state, was a profound analysis of Austrian-Czech
tensions. Masaryk founded two periodicals, in one of which he proved after a bitter debate
that two ostensibly early medieval Czech poems, regarded as Slavic counterparts of the
German Nibelungenlied, were in fact patriotic forgeries by an early 19th-century Czech
poet.
In 1889 Masaryk entered upon his political career after transforming a journal into a
political review. In the early 1890s he began to turn his attention to the Slovaks in northern
Hungary. By criticizing both the feudal nature of Hungarian sovereignty and the antiquated
Pan-Slav tendencies of the Slovak politicians, he became the idol of the young Slovak
progressives who played a decisive role in the Czech-Slovak union in 1918–19. After
unmasking the forged medieval Czech poems, he demonstrated his willingness to risk

unpopularity in pursuit of moral righteousness once again when he succeeded in 1899 in
proving the innocence of Jews accused in a ritual-murder case. Although deeply involved
in political controversies, Masaryk published two monumental works before 1914. In his
work on Marxism (1898), he discussed the immanent contradictions of both capitalism and
socialism. In Russia and Europe (1913) he provided a critical survey of the Russian
religious, intellectual, and social crises—the contradictions and confusions of the
“Byzantine” retardation of Russian society by the Orthodox church and reactionary ideas.
As a politician Masaryk was at first an adherent of the federative Austro-Slavism
envisioned in 1848. But as a democrat he gradually became estranged from the loyal,
conservative, and Roman Catholic concept of the Old Czech Party and accepted the
invitation of the liberal, bourgeois Young Czech Party. In 1891 he was elected to the
Austrian Reichsrat, but, after disagreeing with the Young Czechs’ emotional nationalism,
he resigned his seat in 1893. In March 1900 he founded his own Realist Party, and, after his
reelection in a more democratic Reichsrat, he became an outstanding figure of the left Slav
opposition there. In both the Reichsrat and the standing committee of the Austrian and
Hungarian parliaments, he attacked Austria-Hungary’s alliance with Germany and its
imperialistic politics in the Balkans. He defended the rights of the Serbs and Croats—
especially at the time of the annexation of Bosnia and Hercegovina by Austria.
Fight for Czech and Slovak independence
In early 1915, after the outbreak of World War I,
Masaryk made his way to western Europe, where he
was recognized as the representative of the
underground Czech liberation movement and
conducted a vigorous campaign against Austria-
Hungary and Germany. His British and French friends
helped him to establish contact with the Allied
leaders, to whom he delineated the Czech aims: restitution of Bohemia’s independence on a
democratic basis; establishment of Czech-Slovak unity; dismemberment of Austria-
Hungary according to ethnic principles; and establishment of new states between Germany
and Russia as a cordon sanitaire (“sanitary line,” or line drawn around an infected spot)
against German imperialism.
After the overthrow of the autocratic tsarist regime in 1917, Masaryk transferred his
activities to Russia in order to organize the Czechoslovak Legion, formed by Czechoslovak
war prisoners, and to develop contacts with the new government. After the Bolshevik

Revolution, he set out for the United States, where he was welcomed by Czech and Slovak
groups and where he negotiated the terms of Czechoslovak independence with President
Woodrow Wilson and Secretary of State Robert Lansing. The Lansing Declaration of May
1918 expressed the sympathy of the U.S. government with the Czechoslovak freedom
movement, and Czechoslovakia’s liberation became one of Wilson’s Fourteen Points for
the post-World War I peace settlement. Masaryk also concluded the so-called Pittsburgh
Convention with the Slovak associations in the United States, which promised the Slovaks
a large measure of home rule; the interpretation of this declaration led to controversies
between the Slovak opposition and the Czechoslovak government during the life of the first
Czech republic.
On June 3, 1918, Czechoslovakia was recognized as
an Allied power, and its frontiers were demarcated
according to Masaryk’s outline. As Masaryk had
promised, the new multinational state respected the
minority rights of its large German and Hungarian
ethnic groups. On Nov. 14, 1918, he was elected
president of Czechoslovakia, and he was reelected in 1920, 1927, and 1934. As a true
“liberator” and “father of his country,” he was constantly occupied in settling the crises
resulting from the conflicts between the Czech and the Slovak parties, as well as from
Slovakia’s minority status. A philosopher and democrat, Masaryk was among the first to
voice his anxiety over central Europe’s fate after the Nazis came to power in Germany in
1933. He resigned his post in December 1935 and died nearly two years later.

Early life Masaryk’s father was a Slovak coachman; his mother, a maid, came from a Germanized Moravian family. Though he was trained to be a teacher, he briefly became a locksmith’s apprentice but then entered the German Hochschule in Brno in 1865. Continuing his studies at the University of Vienna, he obtained his doctorate in 1876. He studied for a year in Leipzig, where he met an American student of music, Charlotte Garrigue, whom he married in 1878. He was appointed lecturer in philosophy in Vienna in 1879, and he became professor of philosophy in the Czech university of Prague in 1882. Masaryk was a Neo-Kantian, but he was also strongly influenced by the English puritan ethics and the austere teaching of the Hussites. At the same time, he showed a critical interest in the self-contradictions of capitalism—e.g., in his first major work, a study of suicide as a mass phenomenon of modern civilization. Masaryk’s early works on the Czech Reformation and the Czech revival of the early 19th century were intended to remind the Czechs of the “religious meaning” of their heritage. His treatise on the work of the Czech historian František Palacký, who favoured equal rights for Slavs within the Austrian state, was a profound analysis of Austrian-Czech tensions. Masaryk founded two periodicals, in one of which he proved after a bitter debate that two ostensibly early medieval Czech poems, regarded as Slavic counterparts of the German Nibelungenlied, were in fact patriotic forgeries by an early 19th-century Czech poet. In 1889 Masaryk entered upon his political career after transforming a journal into a political review. In the early 1890s he began to turn his attention to the Slovaks in northern Hungary. By criticizing both the feudal nature of Hungarian sovereignty and the antiquated Pan-Slav tendencies of the Slovak politicians, he became the idol of the young Slovak progressives who played a decisive role in the Czech-Slovak union in 1918–19. After unmasking the forged medieval Czech poems, he demonstrated his willingness to risk  Tomáš Masaryk   Masaryk, Tomáš unpopularity in pursuit of moral righteousness once again when he succeeded in 1899 in proving the innocence of Jews accused in a ritual-murder case. Although deeply involved in political controversies, Masaryk published two monumental works before 1914. In his work on Marxism (1898), he discussed the immanent contradictions of both capitalism and socialism. In Russia and Europe (1913) he provided a critical survey of the Russian religious, intellectual, and social crises—the contradictions and confusions of the “Byzantine” retardation of Russian society by the Orthodox church and reactionary ideas. As a politician Masaryk was at first an adherent of the federative Austro-Slavism envisioned in 1848. But as a democrat he gradually became estranged from the loyal, conservative, and Roman Catholic concept of the Old Czech Party and accepted the invitation of the liberal, bourgeois Young Czech Party. In 1891 he was elected to the Austrian Reichsrat, but, after disagreeing with the Young Czechs’ emotional nationalism, he resigned his seat in 1893. In March 1900 he founded his own Realist Party, and, after his reelection in a more democratic Reichsrat, he became an outstanding figure of the left Slav opposition there. In both the Reichsrat and the standing committee of the Austrian and Hungarian parliaments, he attacked Austria-Hungary’s alliance with Germany and its imperialistic politics in the Balkans. He defended the rights of the Serbs and Croats— especially at the time of the annexation of Bosnia and Hercegovina by Austria. Fight for Czech and Slovak independence In early 1915, after the outbreak of World War I, Masaryk made his way to western Europe, where he was recognized as the representative of the underground Czech liberation movement and conducted a vigorous campaign against Austria- Hungary and Germany. His British and French friends helped him to establish contact with the Allied leaders, to whom he delineated the Czech aims: restitution of Bohemia’s independence on a democratic basis; establishment of Czech-Slovak unity; dismemberment of Austria- Hungary according to ethnic principles; and establishment of new states between Germany and Russia as a cordon sanitaire (“sanitary line,” or line drawn around an infected spot) against German imperialism. After the overthrow of the autocratic tsarist regime in 1917, Masaryk transferred his activities to Russia in order to organize the Czechoslovak Legion, formed by Czechoslovak war prisoners, and to develop contacts with the new government. After the Bolshevik  Tomáš Masaryk   Revolution, he set out for the United States, where he was welcomed by Czech and Slovak groups and where he negotiated the terms of Czechoslovak independence with President Woodrow Wilson and Secretary of State Robert Lansing. The Lansing Declaration of May 1918 expressed the sympathy of the U.S. government with the Czechoslovak freedom movement, and Czechoslovakia’s liberation became one of Wilson’s Fourteen Points for the post-World War I peace settlement. Masaryk also concluded the so-called Pittsburgh Convention with the Slovak associations in the United States, which promised the Slovaks a large measure of home rule; the interpretation of this declaration led to controversies between the Slovak opposition and the Czechoslovak government during the life of the first Czech republic. On June 3, 1918, Czechoslovakia was recognized as an Allied power, and its frontiers were demarcated according to Masaryk’s outline. As Masaryk had promised, the new multinational state respected the minority rights of its large German and Hungarian ethnic groups. On Nov. 14, 1918, he was elected president of Czechoslovakia, and he was reelected in 1920, 1927, and 1934. As a true “liberator” and “father of his country,” he was constantly occupied in settling the crises resulting from the conflicts between the Czech and the Slovak parties, as well as from Slovakia’s minority status. A philosopher and democrat, Masaryk was among the first to voice his anxiety over central Europe’s fate after the Nazis came to power in Germany in 1933. He resigned his post in December 1935 and died nearly two years later. Ludwig von Gogolák",

Ton Duc Thang, (born Aug. 19, 1888, Long Xuyen province, Vietnam—died March 30,
1980, Hanoi), Communist leader who succeeded Ho Chi Minh as president of the
Democratic Republic of Vietnam in 1969 and from 1976 was president of the reunited
Socialist Republic of Vietnam.
In his youth Ton Duc Thang was an enthusiastic Communist. He joined the French Navy in
1912; and in 1918–19, while aboard the French warship Waldeck-Rousseau on its way to
curb revolutionary activities in Russia, he took part in an unsuccessful plot to turn the
battleship over to the Bolshevik revolutionaries. He also instigated strikes against French
intervention in revolutionary China in 1925. As a result of such activities, the French
imprisoned him at Poulo Condore (Con Son, island off the southern coast of Vietnam) in
1929, where he remained until 1945.
Ton Duc Thang reemerged as a public figure in 1946, after the August revolution of 1945
had swept Ho Chi Minh’s Vietnam League for Independence (Viet Minh) into power. He
presided over the new revolutionary government’s permanent committee of the National
Assembly, obtaining extensive legislative powers. During the resistance against the French
in Indochina, 1946–54, Ton Duc Thang was the president of Hoi Lien Hien Quoc Dan Viet
Nam (Lien Viet), the National Popular Front Association. Following the Geneva
Conference of 1954, which placed the Viet Minh in control of North Vietnam, the Lien Viet
was dissolved and reorganized under the name Mat-tran To-Quoc (Fatherland Front), with
Ton Duc Thang as president. In 1955 the Fatherland Front took on the functions of the Lien
Viet and the Viet Minh and tried to attract the allegiance of the South Vietnamese.
In 1960 Ton Duc Thang became vice president of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam
(DRV) and was charged with winning over the south. The DRV supported the insurgent
National Liberation Front (Viet Cong) in South Vietnam. Ton Duc Thang was awarded the
Lenin Peace Prize in 1967.

Toussaint Louverture
Toussaint Louverture
Toussaint Louverture
Toussaint Louverture, Louverture also spelled
L’Ouverture, original name (until c. 1793) François
Dominique Toussaint, (born c. 1743, Bréda, near
Cap-Français, Saint-Domingue [Haiti]—died April 7,
1803, Fort-de-Joux, France), leader of the Haitian
independence movement during the French
Revolution (1787–99). He emancipated the slaves and
negotiated for the French colony on Hispaniola, Saint-Domingue (later Haiti), to be
governed, briefly, by Black former slaves as a French protectorate.
Rise to power
Toussaint was the son of an educated slave. He acquired through Jesuit contacts some
knowledge of French, though he wrote and spoke it poorly, usually employing Haitian
Creole and African tribal language. Winning the favour of the plantation manager, he
became a livestock handler, healer, coachman, and finally steward. Legally freed in 1776,
he married and had two sons. Toussaint was homely, short, and small framed. He was a
fervent Roman Catholic, opposed to Vodou (Voodoo). He dressed simply and was
abstemious and a vegetarian. Although he slept little, his energy and capacity for work
were astonishing. As a leader he inspired awe and adulation.
When a sudden slave revolt began in the northern
province (August 1791) and soon spread to
encompass thousands of slaves across the colony,
Toussaint was at first uncommitted. After hesitating a
few weeks, he helped his former master escape and
then joined the Black forces who were burning
plantations and killing many Europeans and mulattoes
(people of mixed African and European ancestry). He soon discerned the ineptitude of the
rebel leaders and scorned their willingness to compromise with European radicals.
Collecting an army of his own, Toussaint trained his followers in the tactics of guerrilla
warfare. In 1793 he added to his original name the name of Louverture; the name’s exact
significance is unknown, but its meaning in French, “opening,” may have referred to his
tactical ability as a military commander.

When France and Spain went to war in 1793, the Black commanders joined the Spaniards
of Santo Domingo, the eastern two-thirds of Hispaniola (now the Dominican Republic).
Knighted and recognized as a general, Toussaint demonstrated extraordinary military
ability and attracted such renowned warriors as his nephew Moïse and two future monarchs
of Haiti, Jean-Jacques Dessalines and Henry Christophe. Toussaint’s victories in the north,
together with mulatto successes in the south and British occupation of the coasts, brought
the French close to disaster. Yet, in May 1794, Toussaint went over to the French, giving as
his reasons that the French National Convention had recently freed all slaves, while Spain
and Britain refused, and that he had become a republican. He has been criticized for the
duplicity of his dealings with his onetime allies and for a slaughter of Spaniards at a mass.
His switch was decisive: the governor of Saint-Domingue, Étienne Laveaux, made
Toussaint lieutenant governor; the British suffered severe reverses; and the Spaniards were
expelled.
By 1795 Toussaint Louverture was widely renowned. He was adored by Blacks and
appreciated by most Europeans and mulattoes, for he did much to restore the economy.
Defying French Revolutionary laws, he allowed many émigré planters to return, and he
used military discipline to force the former slaves to work. Convinced that people were
naturally corrupt, he felt that compulsion was needed to prevent idleness. Yet the labourers
were no longer whipped: they were legally free and equal, and they shared the profits of the
restored plantations. Racial tensions were eased because Toussaint preached reconciliation
and believed that Blacks, a majority of whom were African born, had to learn from
Europeans and Europeanized mulattoes.
Elimination of rivals
Though he worked well with Laveaux, Toussaint eased him out in 1796. Léger-Félicité
Sonthonax, a terrorist French commissioner, allowed Toussaint to rule and made him
governor-general. But the ascetic Black general was repelled by the proposals of the
European radical to exterminate the Europeans, and he was offended by Sonthonax’s
atheism, coarseness, and immorality. After some devious maneuvers, Toussaint forced
Sonthonax out in 1797.
Next to go were the British, whose losses caused them to negotiate secretly with Toussaint,
notwithstanding the war with France. Treaties in 1798 and 1799 secured their complete
withdrawal. Lucrative trade was begun with Britain and with the United States. In return
for arms and goods, Toussaint sold sugar and promised not to invade Jamaica or the
American South. The British offered to recognize him as king of an independent Haiti, but,

scornful of pompous titles and distrustful of the British because they maintained slavery, he
refused.
Toussaint soon rid himself of another nominal French superior, Gabriel Hédouville, who
arrived in 1798 as representative of the Directory (the French Revolutionary government).
Knowing that France had no chance of restoring colonialism as long as the war with
England continued, Hédouville attempted to pit against Toussaint the mulatto leader André
Rigaud, who ruled a semi-independent state in the south. Toussaint divined his purpose and
forced Hédouville to flee. Succeeding Hédouville was Philippe Roume, who deferred to the
Black governor. Then a bloody campaign in 1799 eliminated another potential rival to
Toussaint by driving Rigaud out and destroying his mulatto state. A purge that was carried
out by Jean-Jacques Dessalines in the south was so brutal that reconciliation with the
mulattoes was impossible.
Command of Hispaniola
Controlling all Saint-Domingue, Toussaint turned to Spanish Santo Domingo, where
slavery persisted. Ignoring commands to the contrary by Roume and by Napoleon
Bonaparte, who had become first consul of France, Toussaint overran it in January 1801,
freed the slaves, and amazed the Europeans and mulattoes with his magnanimity.
In command of the entire island, Toussaint dictated a constitution that made him governor-
general for life with near absolute powers. Catholicism was the state religion, and many
revolutionary principles received ostensible sanction. There was no provision for a French
official, however, because Toussaint professed himself a Frenchman and strove to convince
Bonaparte of his loyalty. He also described his success in restoring order and prosperity in
epistles that, like all his writings, were ungrammatical yet testify to the grasp, incisiveness,
and depth of a formidable intellect.
Bonaparte had confirmed Toussaint Louverture’s position but saw him as an obstacle to the
restoration of Saint-Domingue as a profitable colony. Toussaint knew Bonaparte despised
Blacks and planned to reinstitute slavery. He was also aware that Bonaparte would seek to
intimidate the island upon making peace with England; therefore, he drilled a huge army
and stored supplies. Yet Toussaint behaved ambiguously: venerating France, fearing
Bonaparte, aging and growing weary, he trusted no one and failed to clarify his purposes.
He desired above all to prevent a restoration of slavery while preserving the society he had
built. Europeans and mulattoes looked hopefully to France to repress the huge Black
majority; on the other hand, many Black leaders, such as Moïse, wanted to expel all

Europeans and divide the plantations. Some Blacks were alienated by Toussaint’s perfidies
and equivocations, his mysteriousness, and the occasional atrocities he thought necessary
amid such dangers.
A French invasion under Gen. Charles Leclerc began in January 1802 in far greater force
than expected. Most Europeans and mulattoes defected to him; after a few weeks of furious
fighting, the chief Black leaders, even Christophe and Dessalines, sided with Leclerc as
well. In May Toussaint formally agreed to lay down his arms in exchange for Leclerc’s
promise not to restore slavery.
Toussaint retired in honour to a plantation. A few weeks later, in June, he was invited to a
parley by a French general, Jean-Baptiste Brunet, under false pretenses. With the
cooperation of Leclerc and under orders from Napoleon, who suspected him of plotting an
uprising, Toussaint was seized at Brunet’s home and sent to Fort-de-Joux in the French Jura
Mountains, where he was confined and interrogated repeatedly and where he died in April
1803.

Fagg']","Toussaint Louverture Toussaint Louverture Toussaint Louverture, Louverture also spelled L’Ouverture, original name (until c. 1793) François Dominique Toussaint, (born c. 1743, Bréda, near Cap-Français, Saint-Domingue [Haiti]—died April 7, 1803, Fort-de-Joux, France), leader of the Haitian independence movement during the French Revolution (1787–99). He emancipated the slaves and negotiated for the French colony on Hispaniola, Saint-Domingue (later Haiti), to be governed, briefly, by Black former slaves as a French protectorate. Rise to power Toussaint was the son of an educated slave. He acquired through Jesuit contacts some knowledge of French, though he wrote and spoke it poorly, usually employing Haitian Creole and African tribal language. Winning the favour of the plantation manager, he became a livestock handler, healer, coachman, and finally steward. Legally freed in 1776, he married and had two sons. Toussaint was homely, short, and small framed. He was a fervent Roman Catholic, opposed to Vodou (Voodoo). He dressed simply and was abstemious and a vegetarian. Although he slept little, his energy and capacity for work were astonishing. As a leader he inspired awe and adulation. When a sudden slave revolt began in the northern province (August 1791) and soon spread to encompass thousands of slaves across the colony, Toussaint was at first uncommitted. After hesitating a few weeks, he helped his former master escape and then joined the Black forces who were burning plantations and killing many Europeans and mulattoes (people of mixed African and European ancestry). He soon discerned the ineptitude of the rebel leaders and scorned their willingness to compromise with European radicals. Collecting an army of his own, Toussaint trained his followers in the tactics of guerrilla warfare. In 1793 he added to his original name the name of Louverture; the name’s exact significance is unknown, but its meaning in French, “opening,” may have referred to his tactical ability as a military commander. Toussaint Louverture   When France and Spain went to war in 1793, the Black commanders joined the Spaniards of Santo Domingo, the eastern two-thirds of Hispaniola (now the Dominican Republic). Knighted and recognized as a general, Toussaint demonstrated extraordinary military ability and attracted such renowned warriors as his nephew Moïse and two future monarchs of Haiti, Jean-Jacques Dessalines and Henry Christophe. Toussaint’s victories in the north, together with mulatto successes in the south and British occupation of the coasts, brought the French close to disaster. Yet, in May 1794, Toussaint went over to the French, giving as his reasons that the French National Convention had recently freed all slaves, while Spain and Britain refused, and that he had become a republican. He has been criticized for the duplicity of his dealings with his onetime allies and for a slaughter of Spaniards at a mass. His switch was decisive: the governor of Saint-Domingue, Étienne Laveaux, made Toussaint lieutenant governor; the British suffered severe reverses; and the Spaniards were expelled. By 1795 Toussaint Louverture was widely renowned. He was adored by Blacks and appreciated by most Europeans and mulattoes, for he did much to restore the economy. Defying French Revolutionary laws, he allowed many émigré planters to return, and he used military discipline to force the former slaves to work. Convinced that people were naturally corrupt, he felt that compulsion was needed to prevent idleness. Yet the labourers were no longer whipped: they were legally free and equal, and they shared the profits of the restored plantations. Racial tensions were eased because Toussaint preached reconciliation and believed that Blacks, a majority of whom were African born, had to learn from Europeans and Europeanized mulattoes. Elimination of rivals Though he worked well with Laveaux, Toussaint eased him out in 1796. Léger-Félicité Sonthonax, a terrorist French commissioner, allowed Toussaint to rule and made him governor-general. But the ascetic Black general was repelled by the proposals of the European radical to exterminate the Europeans, and he was offended by Sonthonax’s atheism, coarseness, and immorality. After some devious maneuvers, Toussaint forced Sonthonax out in 1797. Next to go were the British, whose losses caused them to negotiate secretly with Toussaint, notwithstanding the war with France. Treaties in 1798 and 1799 secured their complete withdrawal. Lucrative trade was begun with Britain and with the United States. In return for arms and goods, Toussaint sold sugar and promised not to invade Jamaica or the American South. The British offered to recognize him as king of an independent Haiti, but,  Toussaint Louverture   scornful of pompous titles and distrustful of the British because they maintained slavery, he refused. Toussaint soon rid himself of another nominal French superior, Gabriel Hédouville, who arrived in 1798 as representative of the Directory (the French Revolutionary government). Knowing that France had no chance of restoring colonialism as long as the war with England continued, Hédouville attempted to pit against Toussaint the mulatto leader André Rigaud, who ruled a semi-independent state in the south. Toussaint divined his purpose and forced Hédouville to flee. Succeeding Hédouville was Philippe Roume, who deferred to the Black governor. Then a bloody campaign in 1799 eliminated another potential rival to Toussaint by driving Rigaud out and destroying his mulatto state. A purge that was carried out by Jean-Jacques Dessalines in the south was so brutal that reconciliation with the mulattoes was impossible. Command of Hispaniola Controlling all Saint-Domingue, Toussaint turned to Spanish Santo Domingo, where slavery persisted. Ignoring commands to the contrary by Roume and by Napoleon Bonaparte, who had become first consul of France, Toussaint overran it in January 1801, freed the slaves, and amazed the Europeans and mulattoes with his magnanimity. In command of the entire island, Toussaint dictated a constitution that made him governor- general for life with near absolute powers. Catholicism was the state religion, and many revolutionary principles received ostensible sanction. There was no provision for a French official, however, because Toussaint professed himself a Frenchman and strove to convince Bonaparte of his loyalty. He also described his success in restoring order and prosperity in epistles that, like all his writings, were ungrammatical yet testify to the grasp, incisiveness, and depth of a formidable intellect. Bonaparte had confirmed Toussaint Louverture’s position but saw him as an obstacle to the restoration of Saint-Domingue as a profitable colony. Toussaint knew Bonaparte despised Blacks and planned to reinstitute slavery. He was also aware that Bonaparte would seek to intimidate the island upon making peace with England; therefore, he drilled a huge army and stored supplies. Yet Toussaint behaved ambiguously: venerating France, fearing Bonaparte, aging and growing weary, he trusted no one and failed to clarify his purposes. He desired above all to prevent a restoration of slavery while preserving the society he had built. Europeans and mulattoes looked hopefully to France to repress the huge Black majority; on the other hand, many Black leaders, such as Moïse, wanted to expel all  Toussaint Louverture   Europeans and divide the plantations. Some Blacks were alienated by Toussaint’s perfidies and equivocations, his mysteriousness, and the occasional atrocities he thought necessary amid such dangers. A French invasion under Gen. Charles Leclerc began in January 1802 in far greater force than expected. Most Europeans and mulattoes defected to him; after a few weeks of furious fighting, the chief Black leaders, even Christophe and Dessalines, sided with Leclerc as well. In May Toussaint formally agreed to lay down his arms in exchange for Leclerc’s promise not to restore slavery. Toussaint retired in honour to a plantation. A few weeks later, in June, he was invited to a parley by a French general, Jean-Baptiste Brunet, under false pretenses. With the cooperation of Leclerc and under orders from Napoleon, who suspected him of plotting an uprising, Toussaint was seized at Brunet’s home and sent to Fort-de-Joux in the French Jura Mountains, where he was confined and interrogated repeatedly and where he died in April 1803.

Truong Chinh
Truong Chinh, original name Dang Xuan Khu, (born Feb. 9, 1907, Ha Nam Ninh
province, Vietnam—died Sept. 30, 1988, Hanoi), Vietnamese scholar and statesman, a
leading North Vietnamese communist intellectual.
While a high school student at Nam Dinh, Truong Chinh became an activist in the
anticolonialist movement; he joined Ho Chi Minh’s organization, the Vietnamese
Revolutionary Youth Association, in 1928, taking part in student demonstrations against the
French. Arrested and expelled from the local high school, he continued his education in
Hanoi, where he received his degree and supported himself as a teacher while pursuing a
political career within the recently formed Indochinese Communist Party (PCI). While
editing a Communist Party newspaper in Hanoi, he was arrested by the French in 1932 and
spent the next four years in prison. Paroled in 1936, he was a well-qualified candidate for
command in the PCI, most of whose earlier leaders had been executed or exiled. About this
time he adopted the name Truong Chinh (“Long March”), after Mao Zedong’s famous
march.
The Communist Party was banned in Indochina during World War II, and Truong Chinh
and his associates continued their work underground. In 1941 Truong Chinh became
secretary-general of the PCI, in charge of the dissemination of communist doctrine in
Vietnam. With General Vo Nguyen Giap, Truong Chinh planned the tactical strategy that
led to victory by the Vietnamese over Japanese occupation forces in August 1945 and to the
establishment of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, headed by Ho Chi Minh. Truong
Chinh described these events in his book The August Revolution. The PCI was disbanded
but reemerged as the Alliance for the Dissemination of Marxism, with Truong Chinh as its
chairman and leading theoretician. In 1951 the Vietnam Workers’ Party (Dang Lao-Dong
Viet-Nam) was born, with Truong Chinh as secretary-general.
Truong Chinh’s power was eclipsed briefly in 1956, when he was held responsible for
failures of the Central Reform Committee. He lost his post as secretary-general of the party,
but by April 1958 he had again become a public figure and was appointed vice premier of
North Vietnam and president of the Scientific Research Council. Following the death of Ho
Chi Minh in 1969, Truong Chinh, Le Duan, and Pham Van Dong formed the controlling
triumvirate of North Vietnamese politics. He was chairman of the Standing Committee of
the National Assembly from 1960 to 1981 and was president of the State Council from
1981 to 1987.

Truong Chinh sought to organize North Vietnam along lines similar to those of the People’s

he wrote The Resistance Will Win (1947), an explicit set of directives for guerrilla warfare.

appointed a deputy public prosecutor in the Malayan Federal Legal Department, a post he
resigned in 1951 to begin a political career. He became president of the United Malays

Chinese Association (1951) and with the Malayan Indian Congress (1955). His Alliance
Party won an overwhelming majority in the election of 1955, and Abdul Rahman became
chief minister and home minister of Malaya.
The mission he led to London (January 1956) to negotiate for independence secured
immediate internal self-government and the pledge of independence by August 1957. When
Malaya became independent, he became its first prime minister and foreign minister, and
he continued in that post when the federation of Malaysia was formed in 1963.
In September 1970, one year after the outbreak of riots between the Chinese and the

Ne Win, U
U Ne Win
U Ne Win, original name Shu Maung, (born May 24,
1911, Paungdale, Burma [Myanmar]—died
December 5, 2002, Yangon, Myanmar), Burmese
general who was the leader of Burma (now Myanmar)
from 1962 to 1988.
Shu Maung studied at University College, Rangoon
(now Yangon), from 1929 to 1931, and in the mid-1930s he became involved in the
struggle for Burmese independence from the British. During World War II, after the
Japanese invasion of Burma, he was one of the Thirty Comrades who, in 1941, went to
Hainan province in China to receive military training from the occupying Japanese there. It
was at that time that he adoped the name Ne Win. He subsequently served as an officer in
the Japanese-sponsored Burma National Army from 1943 to 1945, but, becoming
disillusioned with the Japanese, he helped organize the underground resistance. After
Burma gained independence from Britain on January 4, 1948, he served as the second
commander in chief of the army.
In 1958 Ne Win was asked to serve as prime minister in a caretaker government after the
administration of former prime minister U Nu proved incapable of suppressing the ethnic
insurgencies that were crippling the country. Ne Win held general elections in 1960,
stepping down that same year after U Nu’s reelection and the restoration of parliamentary
government. However, on March 2, 1962, Ne Win carried out a coup d’état, imprisoning U
Nu and establishing the Revolutionary Council of the Union of Burma, whose members
were drawn almost exclusively from the armed forces.
In his subsequent rule, Ne Win combined a repressive military dictatorship with a socialist
economic program, the cornerstone of which was the nationalization of Burma’s major
economic enterprises. His government broke the control of Indian, Chinese, and Pakistani

program of rapid industrialization. Ne Win steered a neutralist course in foreign policy and
isolated Burma from contacts with the outside world. His regime made Burma into a one-
party state in 1964; the sole party permitted to exist was the Burmese Socialist Program
Party (BSPP), which had been founded by Ne Win and which was dominated by military
officers. Ne Win and his colleagues formulated a new constitution in 1972–73 that
provided for a one-party state in Burma. A new government was elected in 1974 with Ne

Win as president (1974–81). He subsequently retained the post of chairman of the BSPP,
remaining the country’s preeminent leader.
By the late 1980s Ne Win’s socialist and isolationist policies had turned Burma into one of
the world’s poorest countries. Governmental corruption and mismanagement had driven
much of the country’s economic activity underground into the black market, and Burma,
which had once been a leading rice exporter, was beginning to experience food shortages.
In late 1987 widespread antigovernment rioting broke out in the major cities and was
followed in the spring and summer of 1988 by even larger student-led protests. In both
instances the government resorted to brutal measures to supress the uprisings that included
killing hundreds of demonstrators and jailing thousands more.
The disturbances prompted Ne Win in July 1988 to resign from the BSPP chairmanship.
The BSPP subsequently fell from power in the government and was replaced in September
by the State Law and Order Restoration Council, which was also headed by military
officers. Ne Win is largely thought to have remained active behind the scenes, at least into
the 1990s. In March 2002, however, he was placed under house arrest following the
imprisonment of several family members who were accused of plotting a coup against the
country’s military junta. Although no charges were brought against Ne Win, he remained
under house arrrest until his death.

Shu Maung studied at University College, Rangoon (now Yangon), from 1929 to 1931, and in the mid-1930s he became involved in the struggle for Burmese independence from the British. During World War II, after the Japanese invasion of Burma, he was one of the Thirty Comrades who, in 1941, went to Hainan province in China to receive military training from the occupying Japanese there. It was at that time that he adoped the name Ne Win. He subsequently served as an officer in the Japanese-sponsored Burma National Army from 1943 to 1945, but, becoming disillusioned with the Japanese, he helped organize the underground resistance. After Burma gained independence from Britain on January 4, 1948, he served as the second commander in chief of the army. In 1958 Ne Win was asked to serve as prime minister in a caretaker government after the administration of former prime minister U Nu proved incapable of suppressing the ethnic insurgencies that were crippling the country. Ne Win held general elections in 1960, stepping down that same year after U Nu’s reelection and the restoration of parliamentary government. However, on March 2, 1962, Ne Win carried out a coup d’état, imprisoning U Nu and establishing the Revolutionary Council of the Union of Burma, whose members were drawn almost exclusively from the armed forces. In his subsequent rule, Ne Win combined a repressive military dictatorship with a socialist economic program, the cornerstone of which was the nationalization of Burma’s major economic enterprises.

U Nu
U Nu, formerly Thakin Nu, (born May 25, 1907, Wakema, Burma [Myanmar]—died Feb.
14, 1995, Yangon), Burmese independence leader and prime minister of Myanmar
(formerly Burma) from 1948 to 1958 and from 1960 to 1962.
U Nu was educated at the University of Rangoon (Yangon), from which he received his
B.A. degree in 1929. For some years headmaster of the National High School in Pantanaw,
he returned to the university in 1934 to study law, becoming president of the Student Union
of Rangoon and joining student political movements. His expulsion and that of the young
leader Aung San from the university in 1936 resulted in a student strike. One of the first
confrontations between young Burmese nationalists and the British colonial authorities, it
gained Nu national prominence. The following year he joined the We-Burmans Association
and played an important part in the struggle for independence. Jailed by the British in 1940
for sedition, he was released only after the Japanese invaded Burma.
In 1943 U Nu served as foreign minister in Ba Maw’s pro-Japanese government. He soon,
however, became disillusioned with the Japanese. Following the assassination in 1947 of
Aung San, the principal nationalist leader, U Nu was asked to become head of the
government and leader of Burma’s leading political party, the Anti-Fascist People’s
Freedom League (AFPFL). When independence was declared in January 1948, U Nu
became the first prime minister of Myanmar and served for 10 years, with only a brief
interlude out of office in 1956–57. Although U Nu was an able and highly respected
statesman, his government was plagued by communist and ethnic-minority insurrections,
economic stagnation, and administrative inefficiency. His 1948 Pyidawtha (welfare)
program included a Land Nationalization Act, but his efforts to elevate the living standard
of the people were frustrated by the wide extent of war damage and by the drop in rice
exports, which had constituted one of Myanmar’s principal sources of foreign exchange.
His party retained power after winning general elections in 1952 and 1956. U Nu was one
of the founders of the Nonaligned Movement in the 1950s. In 1958 he resigned his post as
prime minister and a “caretaker” government took over, headed by General Ne Win. In
1960 parliamentary government was restored, and U Nu again became prime minister after
his party won elections. In March 1962, however, Ne Win staged a coup d’état, establishing
a military government and putting U Nu in prison.
Following his release from prison, U Nu left Myanmar (1969) and began organizing a
resistance movement against the Ne Win government. When this movement failed, he took

up residence in India, but he returned to Myanmar in 1980 at the invitation of Ne Win. In
July 1980 U Nu returned to Rangoon to become a Buddhist monk. He made an
unsuccessful bid for power after pro-democracy demonstrations toppled Ne Win’s
government in 1988.

U Saw
U Saw, also called Galon U Saw, (born 1900, Tharrawaddy, Burma—died May 8, 1948,
Rangoon), Burmese political leader who conspired in the assassination of Aung San, the
resistance leader who negotiated Burma’s independence from the British.
Unlike most other Burmese politicians, U Saw was not university-educated. He held a
license to plead some types of legal cases, however, and helped in the defense of Saya San,
the leader of the peasant rebellion of 1930–32. U Saw subsequently adopted the honorific
title Galon (a fabulous bird in Hindu mythology) from the name of Saya San’s rebel “Galon
Army.” He served for several terms in the Burma legislative council and was owner and
editor of a nationalist newspaper in Burma, Thuriya (“The Sun”).
Greatly impressed by Japan, which he visited in 1935, U Saw aspired to rebuild Burma
along similar, totalitarian lines. In 1938 he founded the Myochit (“Patriot”) Party and
organized a private Galon army, modeled on the Nazi storm troopers. U Saw helped
engineer the overthrow of prime minister Ba Maw in 1939, and, after serving as minister of
forests, he was prime minister from 1940 to 1942.
In 1941, when U Saw failed in London to obtain dominion status for Burma, he went to
Lisbon to negotiate secretly with the Japanese. Arrested by the British at Haifa in January
1942, he was interned in Uganda for the duration of the war. In 1945, however, he returned
to Burma, reestablished the Myochit Party, and became a major opponent of the Anti-
Fascist People’s Freedom League (AFPFL), which was led by Aung San. U Saw went with
Aung San to London to negotiate with British Prime Minister Clement Attlee, but he
refused to sign the agreement for Burma’s independence of Jan. 27, 1947, on the grounds
that Aung San had made too many concessions to the British. Although he urged a boycott
of the April 9 elections, the AFPFL won an overwhelming victory.
On July 19, 1947, U Saw sent gunmen to assassinate Aung San and the ministers of the
new government. Convicted of conspiracy to murder, he was executed.

Ugo Bassi
Ugo Bassi, (born Aug. 12, 1801, Cento, Cisalpine Republic [Italy]—died Aug. 8, 1849,
Bologna), Italian priest and patriot, who was a follower of Giuseppe Garibaldi in his fight
for Italian independence.
Educated at Bologna, he became a novice in the Barnabite order at age 18, and, after
studying in Rome, he entered the ministry in 1833. He gained fame as a preacher with
eloquent and genuinely enthusiastic sermons that attracted large crowds. Living chiefly at
Bologna, he traveled all over Italy aiding and tending the poor.
At the outbreak of the revolutionary movements in 1848, when Pope Pius IX still appeared
to be a liberal and a nationalist, Bassi joined, as an army chaplain, General Giovanni
Durando’s papal force protecting the frontiers. His eloquence helped draw new recruits into
the republican movement, and he exercised great influence over the soldiers and the people
generally. When Pius discarded all connection with the nationalist movement, only Bassi
was able to restrain the Bolognese in their indignation. He was wounded at Treviso in May
1848 but, on his recovery, marched unarmed at the head of the volunteers at Mestre.
After the pope’s flight from Rome in November and the proclamation of the Roman
republic in early 1849, Bassi joined the forces of Garibaldi, fighting against French troops
that were sent in to restore the temporal power. When Garibaldi was forced to leave Rome,
Bassi followed him to San Marino; when the legion broke up, Garibaldi escaped but Bassi
and a fellow patriot, Count Livraghi, were captured near Comacchio. Turned over to the
Austrian authorities and taken to Bologna, they were charged with having been found with
guns in their hands (Bassi had never borne arms) and were executed.

After the pope’s flight from Rome in November and the proclamation of the Roman republic in early 1849, Bassi joined the forces of Garibaldi, fighting against French troops that were sent in to restore the temporal power. When Garibaldi was forced to leave Rome, Bassi followed him to San Marino; when the legion broke up, Garibaldi escaped but Bassi and a fellow patriot, Count Livraghi, were captured near Comacchio. Turned over to the Austrian authorities and taken to Bologna, they were charged with having been found with guns in their hands (Bassi had never borne arms) and were executed.",

V.K. Krishna Menon, in full Vengalil Krishnan
Krishna Menon, (born May 3, 1897, Calicut [now
Kozhikode], India—died Oct. 6, 1974, New Delhi),
Indian nationalist and champion of India’s
anticolonialism and neutralism.
After studying at the London School of Economics, Menon was called to the bar at the
Middle Temple. He became an ardent socialist and served as a Labour member of the St.
Pancras Borough Council from 1934 to 1947. His primary political interest in England
centred on the struggle for freedom in India, however, and he strove tirelessly in this cause
as secretary of the India League from 1929. His long and close relationship with Jawaharlal
Nehru, nationalist and first prime minister of independent India, began during that period.
With the coming of Indian independence in 1947, Krishna Menon was appointed high
commissioner (ambassador) of India in London. He returned to India in 1952 after 27 years
of residence in England, becoming a member of the Indian Parliament in 1953, minister
without portfolio in 1956, and minister for defense in 1957. From 1952 to 1960 he
represented India in the General Assembly of the United Nations, where his vigorous
presentation of anticolonial and neutralist policies of his government won him many
admirers.
As minister of defense, he brought new vigour to his office and introduced many far-
reaching changes, but his policies and methods received heavy criticism, and the military
reverses suffered by India at the hands of the Chinese in the Himalayas in 1962 were
attributed by some to his policies. Overwhelming opposition forced him to relinquish the
Ministry of Defense in October 1962. Thereafter he devoted himself to left-wing political
activity as an independent.

Vallabhbhai Jhaverbhai Patel
Vallabhbhai Patel
Vallabhbhai Patel, in full Vallabhbhai Jhaverbhai
Patel, byname Sardar Patel (Hindi: “Leader
Patel”), (born October 31, 1875, Nadiad, Gujarat,
India—died December 15, 1950, Bombay [now
Mumbai]), Indian barrister and statesman, one of the
leaders of the Indian National Congress during the
struggle for Indian independence. During the first
three years of Indian independence after 1947, he served as deputy prime minister, minister
of home affairs, minister of information, and minister of states.
Early life and legal career
Patel was born into a self-sufficient landowning family of the Leva Patidar caste. Reared in
an atmosphere of traditional Hinduism, he attended primary school at Karamasad and high
school at Petlad but was mainly self-taught. Patel married at the age of 16, matriculated at
22, and passed the district pleader’s examination, which enabled him to practice law. In
1900 he set up an independent office of district pleader in Godhra, and two years later he
moved to Borsad.
As a lawyer, Patel distinguished himself in presenting an unassailable case in a precise
manner and in challenging police witnesses and British judges. In 1908 Patel lost his wife,
who had borne him a son and daughter, and thereafter remained a widower. Determined to
enhance his career in the legal profession, Patel traveled to London in August 1910 to study
at the Middle Temple. There he studied diligently and passed the final examinations with
high honours.
Returning to India in February 1913, he settled in Ahmadabad, rising rapidly to become the
leading barrister in criminal law at the Ahmadabad bar. Reserved and courteous, he was
noted for his superior mannerisms, his smart, English-style clothes, and his championship
in bridge at Ahmadabad’s fashionable Gujarat Club. He was, until 1917, indifferent to
Indian political activities.
In 1917 Patel found the course of his life changed after having been influenced by
Mohandas K. Gandhi. Patel adhered to Gandhi’s satyagraha (policy of nonviolence) insofar
as it furthered the Indian struggle against the British. But he did not identify himself with
Gandhi’s moral convictions and ideals, and he regarded Gandhi’s emphasis on their

universal application as irrelevant to India’s immediate political, economic, and social
problems. Nevertheless, having resolved to follow and support Gandhi, Patel changed his
style and appearance. He quit the Gujarat Club, dressed in the white cloth of the Indian
peasant, and ate in the Indian manner.
From 1917 to 1924 Patel served as the first Indian municipal commissioner of Ahmadabad
and was its elected municipal president from 1924 to 1928. Patel first made his mark in
1918, when he planned mass campaigns of peasants, farmers, and landowners of Kaira,
Gujarat, against the decision of the Bombay government to collect the full annual revenue
taxes despite crop failures caused by heavy rains.
In 1928 Patel successfully led the landowners of Bardoli in their resistance against
increased taxes. His efficient leadership of the Bardoli campaign earned him the title sardar
(“leader”), and henceforth he was acknowledged as a nationalist leader throughout India.
He was considered practical, decisive, and even ruthless, and the British recognized him as
a dangerous enemy.
Political philosophy
Patel, however, was no revolutionary. In the crucial debate over the objectives of the Indian
National Congress during the years 1928 to 1931, Patel believed (like Gandhi and Motilal
Nehru, but unlike Jawaharlal Nehru and Subhas Chandra Bose) that the goal of the Indian
National Congress should be dominion status within the British Commonwealth—not
independence. In contrast to Jawaharlal Nehru, who condoned violence in the struggle for
independence, Patel ruled out armed revolution, not on moral but on practical grounds.
Patel held that it would be abortive and would entail severe repression. Patel, like Gandhi,
saw advantages in the future participation of a free India in a British Commonwealth,
provided that India was admitted as an equal member. He emphasized the need to foster
Indian self-reliance and self-confidence, but, unlike Gandhi, he did not regard Hindu-
Muslim unity as a prerequisite for independence.
Patel disagreed with Jawaharlal Nehru on the need to bring about economic and social
changes by coercion. A conservative rooted in traditional Hindu values, Patel belittled the
usefulness of adapting socialist ideas to the Indian social and economic structure. He
believed in free enterprise, thus gaining the trust of conservative elements, and thereby
collected the funds that sustained the activities of the Indian National Congress.
Patel was the second candidate after Gandhi to the presidency of the 1929 Lahore session
of the Indian National Congress. Gandhi shunned the presidency in an attempt to prevent

the adoption of the resolution of independence and exerted pressure on Patel to withdraw,
mainly owing to Patel’s uncompromising attitude toward the Muslims; Jawaharlal Nehru
was elected. During the 1930 Salt Satyagraha (prayer and fasting movement), Patel served
three months’ imprisonment. In March 1931 Patel presided over the Karachi session of the
Indian National Congress. He was imprisoned in January 1932. Released in July 1934, he
marshaled the organization of the Congress Party in the 1937 elections and was the main
contender for the 1937–38 Congress presidency. Again, because of Gandhi’s pressure, Patel
withdrew and Jawaharlal Nehru was elected. Along with other Congress leaders, Patel was
imprisoned in October 1940, released in August 1941, and imprisoned once more from
August 1942 until June 1945.
During the war Patel rejected as impractical Gandhi’s nonviolence in the face of the then-
expected Japanese invasion of India. On the transfer of power, Patel differed with Gandhi
in realizing that the partition of the subcontinent into Hindu India and Muslim Pakistan was
inevitable, and he asserted that it was in India’s interests to part with Pakistan.
Patel was the leading candidate for the 1945–46 presidency of the Indian National
Congress, but Gandhi once again intervened for the election of Nehru. Nehru, as president
of the Congress, was invited by the British viceroy to form an interim government. Thus, in
the normal course of events, Patel would have been the first prime minister of India.
During the first three years of independence, Patel was deputy prime minister, minister of
home affairs, minister of information, and minister of states; above all, his enduring fame
rests on his achievement of the peaceful integration of the princely Indian states into the
Indian Union and the political unification of India.

Guerrero continued to lead his guerrilla forces against the Spanish until 1821, when he
joined forces with Agustín de Iturbide and with him issued the Plan of Iguala, which
became the political platform for the conservative wing of the Mexican independence
movement. The Mexican forces triumphed over the Spaniards and achieved independence
for Mexico in August 1821.
Guerrero continued to participate in the military and political struggles that followed
independence, and in March 1829 he attained the presidency of Mexico as the result of a
successful liberal revolt against the conservative candidate who had been chosen president
in the election of 1828. But the aged Guerrerro proved to be less adept at political
administration than at military command, and that same year he was unseated by General
Antonio López de Santa Anna, who replaced him in the presidency with Anastasio
Bustamante. After leading rebel forces Guerrero was captured, tried, and executed.

Vijaya Lakshmi Pandit
Vijaya Lakshmi Pandit, née Swarup Kumari Nehru,
(born Aug. 18, 1900, Allahābād, India—died Dec. 1,
1990, Dehra Dun), Indian political leader and diplomat,
one of the world’s leading women in public life in the
20th century.
She was the daughter of Motilal Nehru, a wealthy and
aristocratic nationalist leader, and sister of Jawaharlal Nehru, the first prime minister of
independent India. In 1921, after receiving a private education in India and abroad, she
married Ranjit Sitaram Pandit (d. 1944), a fellow Congress worker. (In accordance with
conservative Hindu custom, her name was wholly changed upon her marriage, to reflect
her husband’s clan.) In her family’s tradition she became an active worker in the Indian
nationalist movement and was imprisoned three times by the British authorities in India.
She entered municipal government in Allahābād (western India) before entering the
legislative assembly of the United Provinces (later Uttar Pradesh) and becoming minister
for local self-government and public health (1937–39), the first Indian woman to hold a
cabinet portfolio.
With the coming of Indian independence, Pandit entered on a distinguished diplomatic
career, leading the Indian delegation to the United Nations (1946–48, 1952–53) and serving
as India’s ambassador to Moscow (1947–49) and to Washington and Mexico (1949–51). In
1953 Pandit became the first woman to be elected president of the UN General Assembly.
From 1954 to 1961 she was Indian high commissioner (ambassador) in London and
concurrently ambassador to Dublin. She served as governor of the state of Mahārāshtra
from 1962 to 1964, and from 1964 to 1968 she was a member of the Indian Lok Sabha
(parliament), representing the constituency formerly represented by Jawaharlal Nehru.
In 1977 Pandit left the Congress Party to join the Congress for Democracy, which had
merged with the Janata Party. A year later she was appointed the Indian representative to
the UN Human Rights Commission, and in 1979 she published The Scope of Happiness: A
Personal Memoir.

Vinayak Damodar Savarkar
Vinayak Damodar Savarkar, byname Vir or Veer, (born May 28, 1883, Bhagur, India—
died Feb. 26, 1966, Bombay [now Mumbai]), Hindu and Indian nationalist and leading
figure in the Hindu Mahasabha (“Great Society of Hindus”), a Hindu nationalist
organization and political party.
While a student of law in London (1906–10), Savarkar helped to instruct a group of Indian
revolutionaries in methods of sabotage and assassination that associates of his had
apparently learned from expatriate Russian revolutionaries in Paris. During this period he
wrote The Indian War of Independence, 1857 (1909), in which he took the view that the
Indian Mutiny of 1857 was the first expression of Indian mass rebellion against British
colonial rule.
In March 1910 Savarkar was arrested on various charges relating to subversion and
incitement to war and was sent to India for trial and convicted. In a second trial he was
convicted of his alleged complicity in the assassination of a British district magistrate in
India, and, after sentencing, he was transported to the Andaman Islands for detention “for
life.” He was brought back to India in 1921 and released from detention in 1924. While
imprisoned he wrote Hinditva: Who Is a Hindu? (1923), coining the term Hindutva
(“Hinduness”), which sought to define Indian culture as a manifestation of Hindu values;
this concept grew to become a major tenet of Hindu nationalist ideology.
Savarkar resided in Ratnagiri until 1937, when he joined the Hindu Mahasabha, which
militantly defended the Hindus’ claims of religious and cultural supremacy over Indian
Muslims. He served as president of the Mahasabha for seven years. In 1943 he retired to
Bombay. When Mohandas K. Gandhi was assassinated in 1948 by a former member of the
Mahasabha, Savarkar was implicated, but he was acquitted in his subsequent trial because
of insufficient evidence.

Vincas Kudirka, (born Dec. 31, 1858, Paezeriai, Lithuania, Russian Empire—died Nov. 6,
1899, Naumiestis [now Kudirkos-Naumiestis]), Lithuanian physician, writer, and patriot
who, through an underground literary-political journal, Varpas (1889–1905; “The Bell”),
articulated a broadly representative protest against Russian attempts to submerge the
awakening national culture of its Lithuanian provinces.
Educated in medicine, as well as in history and philosophy, Kudirka was working as a
physician when, in 1889, he founded Varpas, to which he soon devoted his full energies.
Varpas, published in Tilsit, Prussia, and smuggled into the Russian Empire, offered poems
and satires by Kudirka and others, as well as vociferous attacks on tsarist Russification
policies. The journal also stirred social reform and was influential in liberal and socialist
circles.
Kudirka translated the works of the 19th-century Romantic poets Lord Byron (English),
Friedrich Schiller (German), and Adam Mickiewicz (Polish) into Lithuanian. His satires
were influenced by the Russian writers Nikolay Gogol, Nikolay Nekrasov, and Count
Mikhail Yevgrafovich Saltykov (N. Shchedrin). The first harmonizer of Lithuanian folk
songs, Kudirka was also the author of the Lithuanian national anthem. The city of his
death, Naumiestis, was later renamed for him.

Vinoba Bhave
Vinoba Bhave, byname of Vinayak Narahari Bhave, (born September 11, 1895, Gagode,
Bombay Presidency [now in Maharashtra], India—died November 15, 1982, Wardha,
Maharashtra), one of India’s best-known social reformers and a widely venerated disciple
of Mohandas K. (Mahatma) Gandhi. Bhave was the founder of the Bhoodan Yajna (“Land-
Gift Movement”).
Born of a high-caste Brahman family, he abandoned his high school studies in 1916 to join
Gandhi’s ashram (ascetic community) at Sabarmati, near Ahmadabad. Gandhi’s teachings
led Bhave to a life of austerity dedicated to improving Indian village life. Bhave was
imprisoned several times during the 1920s and ’30s and served a five-year prison sentence
in the ’40s for leading nonviolent resistance to British rule. He was given the honorific title
acharya (“teacher”).
Bhave’s idea of the land-gift movement was conceived in 1951, while he was touring
villages in the province of Andhra Pradesh, when a landholder offered him an acreage in
response to his appeal on behalf of a group of landless Dalits (members of the lowest
castes, formerly called “untouchables” and now officially named Scheduled Castes). He
then walked from village to village, appealing for gifts of land to be distributed among the
landless and relating the act of giving to the principle of ahimsa (nonviolence), which had
been adopted by Gandhi. According to Bhave, land reform should be secured by a change
of heart and not by enforced government action. His critics maintained that Bhudan Yajna
encouraged the fragmentation of land and would thus obstruct a rational approach to large-
scale agriculture, but Bhave declared that he preferred fragmented land to fragmented
hearts. Later, however, he encouraged gramdan—i.e., the system whereby villagers pooled
their land, after which the land was reorganized under a cooperative system.
Throughout 1975 Bhave took a vow of silence over the issue of the involvement of his
followers in political agitation. As a result of a fast in 1979, he secured the government’s
promise to enforce the law prohibiting the killing of cows (animals sacred to Hinduism)
throughout India. Bhave’s original project and his philosophy of life are explained in a
series of articles collected and published as Bhoodan Yajna (1953, reprinted 1957).

Vladimir Jabotinsky
Vladimir Jabotinsky, (born 1880, Odessa, Russian Empire [now in Ukraine]—died Aug.
3, 1940, near Hunter, N.Y., U.S.), Zionist leader, journalist, orator, and man of letters who
founded the militant Zionist Revisionist movement that played an important role in the
establishment of the State of Israel.
Jabotinsky began his career in 1898 as a foreign correspondent, but his popularity as a
journalist led to his recall to Odessa in 1901 as an editorial writer. By 1903 Jabotinsky
began to expound Zionist views for the restoration and creation of a Jewish national state in
Palestine both in his writings and in his oratory, of which he was a master. During the next
decade, he continued to work as a journalist while traveling in Europe and crystallizing his
Zionist views, which tended to be uncompromising and political, rather than cultural.
During World War I, he was convinced that the Ottoman Empire, then the ruling power in
Palestine, would fall and that in this vacuum the Jews could colonize Palestine if they had
demonstrated service to the Allies. He thus convinced the British government to allow
military participation by Jewish refugees from the Ottoman Empire.
In 1920 Jabotinsky organized and led a Jewish self-defense movement (Haganah) against
the Arabs in Palestine. The British, who then ruled the country, sentenced him to 15 years
at hard labour, but this action provoked such an outcry that he was soon reprieved. In the
1920s he was active in many international Zionist organizations, including the World
Union of Zionist Revisionists in 1925.
Testifying before the British Royal Commission on Palestine, Jabotinsky gave an
impassioned expression of his Revisionist views. The source of Jewish suffering was not
merely anti-Semitism, he said, but the Diaspora (dispersion) itself; the Jews were a
stateless people. Assigning cultural Zionism a relatively low priority, he advocated the
creation of a Palestinian Jewish state on both sides of the Jordan, with continued Jewish
immigration to achieve a Jewish majority there, and employment of Jewish troops for self-
defense as part of the permanent garrison. In 1940, while in the United States to visit Betar,
the youth organization of the Zionist Revisionist Party, Jabotinsky died of a heart attack.
His followers, who had already founded the Irgun Zvai Leumi terrorist group, active in
Palestine in the 1940s, later founded the Israeli Ḥerut Party.

Vo Chi Cong
Vo Chi Cong, (born 1912, Quang Nam province, Annam (now in Vietnam)—died
September 8, 2011, Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam), strongly anti-French Communist
revolutionary who was among the earliest fighters for Vietnam’s independence. He held
key positions in South Vietnam’s National Liberation Front (NLF) and the Provisional
Revolutionary Government—both political arms of the Viet Cong guerrillas—during the
Vietnam War.
Cong began an activist career in 1930 under Phan Boi Chau and Phan Chau Trinh, early
nationalist rebels against the French colonial regime. During World War II he participated
in the underground resistance against Japan and the Vichy French, who arrested him and
kept him under surveillance in 1942.
It was not until 1961 that he emerged into political significance as a founding member of
the NLF. Cong was the chief organizer of the People’s Revolutionary Party, South
Vietnam’s communist party, and became a strong opponent of Saigon’s U.S.-backed
regime. After the reunification of Vietnam in 1976, he joined the new national government,
serving as the minister of fisheries (1976–77) and of agriculture (1977–78) and as a deputy
prime minister (1976–82). He also became a full member of the Politburo of the
Vietnamese Communist Party in 1976.

Vo Nguyen Giap
Vo Nguyen Giap
Vo Nguyen Giap, (born 1912, An Xa, Vietnam—died
October 4, 2013, Hanoi), Vietnamese military and
political leader whose perfection of guerrilla as well
as conventional strategy and tactics led to the Viet
Minh victory over the French (and to the end of
French colonialism in Southeast Asia) and later to the
North Vietnamese victory over South Vietnam and the
United States.
The son of an ardent anticolonialist scholar, Giap as a youth began to work for Vietnamese
autonomy. He attended the same high school as Ho Chi Minh, the communist leader, and
while still a student in 1926 he joined the Tan Viet Cach Menh Dang, the Revolutionary
Party of Young Vietnam. In 1930, as a supporter of student strikes, he was arrested by the
French Sûreté and sentenced to three years in prison, but he was paroled after serving only
a few months. After studying at the Lycée Albert-Sarraut in Hanoi, he received a law
degree from Hanoi University in the late 1930s. Giap then became a professor of history at
the Lycée Thanh Long in Hanoi, where he converted many of his fellow teachers and
students to his political views. In 1938 he married Minh Thai, and together they worked for
the Indochinese Communist Party. When in 1939 the party was prohibited, Giap escaped to
China, but his wife and sister-in-law were captured by the French police. His sister-in-law
was guillotined; his wife received a life sentence and died in prison after three years.
In 1941 Giap formed an alliance with Chu Van Tan, guerrilla leader of the Tho, a minority
tribal group of northeastern Vietnam. Giap hoped to build an army that would drive out the
French and support the goals of the Viet Minh, Ho Chi Minh’s Vietnamese independence
movement. With Ho Chi Minh, Giap marched his forces into Hanoi in August 1945, and in
September Ho announced the independence of Vietnam, with Giap in command of all
police and internal security forces and commander in chief of the armed forces. Giap
sanctioned the execution of many non-Communist nationalists, and he censored nationalist
newspapers to conform with Communist Party directives. In the French Indochina War,
Giap’s brilliance as a military strategist and tactician led to his winning the decisive Battle
of Dien Bien Phu on May 7, 1954, which brought the French colonialist regime to an end.
On the division of the country in July, Giap became deputy prime minister, minister of
defense, and commander in chief of the armed forces of North Vietnam. He subsequently

led the military forces of the north to eventual victory in the Vietnam War, compelling the
Americans to leave the country in 1973 and bringing about the fall of South Vietnam in
1975. From 1976, when the two Vietnams were reunited, to 1980 Giap served as Vietnam’s
minister of national defense; he also became a deputy prime minister in 1976. He was a full
member of the Politburo of the Vietnamese Communist Party until 1982. Giap was the
author of People’s War, People’s Army (1961), a manual of guerrilla warfare based on his
own experience.

Willem Drees
Willem Drees, (born July 5, 1886, Amsterdam, Neth.—died May 14, 1988, The Hague),
statesman and socialist leader who was the prime minister of the Netherlands from 1948 to
1958. His four successive governments augmented his country’s comprehensive welfare
state, continued the postwar abandonment of the traditional Dutch neutrality in favour of
military and economic alliances, and unsuccessfully tried to retain the Republic of
Indonesia as an autonomous state under the Dutch crown.
Educated at Commercial School, Amsterdam, Drees was appointed stenographer to the
Netherlands States General (Parliament) in 1907. A member of the Labour (Social
Democratic) Party, he was elected to the city council of The Hague in 1913 and to the
Second (principal) Chamber of the States-General in 1933. From 1939 he was chairman of
the Labour group in the Second Chamber. When the Germans occupied his country during
World War II, Drees was imprisoned for trying to organize resistance. Released in 1941, he
rejoined the resistance movement and presided over the Fatherland Committee, which
prepared the first governmental measures after the liberation of the Netherlands in 1945.
Drees served (1945–48) as minister of social affairs in the governments of Willem
Schermerhorn and Louis Beel. In 1946 Drees and Schermerhorn, a left-wing Liberal, had
formed a new socialist party, the Partij van de Arbeid (“Party of Labour”). As prime
minister from Aug. 6, 1948, Drees formed ministries that were coalitions of his own party
and the Katholieke Volkspartij (“Catholic People’s Party”). When the latter party dissolved
the coalition in a dispute over new tax proposals, Drees resigned on Dec. 12, 1958, and
retired from politics.
Under Drees’s leadership the Netherlands joined the North Atlantic Treaty Organization
(NATO), the Western European Union (WEU), the European Economic Community
(EEC), and other international associations. In December 1948, war broke out in Indonesia
between the Dutch and the Indonesians, but in 1949 Drees’s government acknowledged the
United States of Indonesia (later the Republic of Indonesia) as a partner in a federation.
Drees was in office when, in 1954, Indonesia terminated this union.

William I
William I
William I, in full William, prince of Orange, count
of Nassau, byname William the Silent, Dutch
Willem, prins van Oranje, graaf van Nassau or
Willem de Zwijger, (born April 24, 1533,
Dillenburg, Nassau [now in Germany]—died July 10,
1584, Delft, Holland [now in the Netherlands]), first
of the hereditary stadtholders (1572–84) of the United
Provinces of the Netherlands and leader of the revolt of the Netherlands against Spanish
rule and the Catholic religion.
Family and inheritance
William, the eldest son of William, count of Nassau-Dillenburg, grew up in a cultivated
Lutheran environment. Far richer than his father’s ancestral possessions in the region of the
Lahn River in Nassau were the estates that, since 1404, another branch of the family had
obtained in Brabant and elsewhere in the Low Countries, where its main seat was at Breda.
At the time of William’s birth, the Brabant branch was represented by his father’s elder
brother Henry and by Henry’s only son, René, who in 1530 had inherited from a maternal
uncle the domains of the house of Chalon-Arlay, so becoming the greatest seigneur of the
Franche-Comté and ruler of the Provençal principality of Orange. René of Orange was
killed in 1544, leaving the combined wealth of the houses of Nassau-Breda and of Chalon-
Orange to his cousin William, then aged 11.
In view of the importance of this heritage, the lord of the Burgundian Netherlands, the
Habsburg emperor Charles V, stipulated that William’s parents should renounce his
guardianship and that the young prince should be educated in his new fatherland as a
Catholic. So William passed his formative years at Breda and Brussels, under the guidance
of suitable tutors, and was duly imbued with the principles proper to a youth of his
standing. French became his daily language, and he acquired a colloquial command of
Dutch.
In spite of his immense landed property, his financial circumstances were straitened from
the beginning. Scarcity of liquid assets continued to hamper him, even after his marriage
(July 8, 1551) to a wealthy heiress, Countess Anne of Egmond-Buren, who brought him

several additional baronies, mainly in Holland. These “structural” pecuniary straits he
shared with most of his class and with the Burgundian government itself.
A favourite with Charles V and with the court at Brussels, the prince faithfully discharged
the social, military, and diplomatic duties that were expected of him. He continued to do so
under Philip II, the emperor’s son and successor as king of Spain and lord of the
Burgundian dominions. Together with his later enemies Antoine Perrenot de Granvelle,
bishop of Arras, and the duke of Alba, he was a negotiator of the Treaty of Cateau-
Cambrésis (1559), which, in ending prolonged strife between Burgundy-Habsburg and
France, released from French occupation his princedom of Orange and made the
Netherlands accessible to Calvinist preachers from France. Philip II, at his accession in
1555, had admitted William to the Council of State, and, now before his departure to Spain,
the king appointed him his stadtholder (governor and commander in chief) in Holland,
Zeeland, and Utrecht (August 1559) and afterward in Franche-Comté (February 1561).
Loyal opposition to the king’s government
From about 1561 William, the prince of Orange, together with other great lords who felt
themselves excluded from their rightful share in the country’s government, began to protest
openly against the conduct of the Brussels administration, in which Granvelle, the principal
adviser of the regent Margaret, duchess of Parma, was the most powerful figure. At first
religious questions were not prominent among the causes of discontent, but they gradually
became so with the spread of Protestant ideas and the determination of Philip II not to
tolerate any deviation from the strictest Catholic orthodoxy. The prince and his associates,
in varying degrees influenced by the comprehensive views of the humanist Desiderius
Erasmus, shared in this respect the feelings of the majority of their countrymen, who, while
remaining conventional Roman Catholics, resented religious persecution. Besides, several
of the nobles had, as had William, friends and parents among the Protestants. On August
25, 1561, the prince, a widower since 1558, reinforced his Lutheran and German
connections by taking as his second wife Anna of Saxony.
In the mind of William, the prince of Orange, the religious issue gradually assumed
paramount importance. In a sensational speech in the Council of State, he argued that it was
not feasible to enforce religious unity and that it was not right for princes to presume to
rule over the consciences of their subjects. But the king in October 1565 gave strict orders
that the ordinances against heretics should be inexorably applied.

Consequently, the situation became increasingly dangerous. The leadership of the
opposition was now taken over by a confederation of lesser nobles and gentlemen, some of
them Calvinists, who were more desperate than the grandees and less averse to a violent
solution; they and their followers soon came to be called the Gueux (Beggars). The great
lords kept aloof, but William and a few others showed sympathy for the movement, with
which the prince was personally in touch through his brother, Count Louis of Nassau, a
Lutheran with Calvinistic leanings. Orange persuaded the confederates not to resort to
armed action but instead to petition the regent Margaret for a suspension of the decrees
against Protestants. The duchess did indeed promise a moderation of the anti-heretical
measures, but it was already too late for minor relaxations to avert trouble. Misery caused
by the economic depression contributed to the violent explosions of religious fanaticism
that shook the Low Countries in August 1566. Calvinist mobs forcibly entered churches,
smashing the images and destroying the furnishings. Besides causing irreparable damage,
these excesses had a threefold effect: peaceful coexistence of Catholics and Protestants
became more difficult; the opposition movement was weakened because its responsible
members felt it necessary to defend the church; and, finally, it caused King Philip to resort
to force in an attempt to crush heresy and rebellion at one blow. To this end, in December
1566, he appointed the duke of Alba as his captain general in the Netherlands.
Orange seems to have contemplated immediate active resistance but in the end did nothing
because the popular hero Lamoral, count of Egmond, stadtholder of Flanders and Artois,
would not support him. William allowed the Protestants, now openly rebellious, to hail him
as their defender, but he upheld public order. As hereditary viscount of Antwerp, he quelled
an insurrection of the numerous Calvinists there, and he kept the city gates closed to rebels
and government forces alike. He protested his loyalty to the king, yet he refused to take the
new oath of unconditional obedience that the regent required from all officeholders and
prudently retired in April 1567 to the family seat at Dillenburg. Many thousands followed
William’s example or had preceded him; a general exodus to England, Germany, and
France took place.
Open revolt and alliance with Calvinism
By May 1567 order was everywhere restored.
Nevertheless, in August Alba entered Brussels at the
head of a well-trained army and inaugurated a reign
of terror. In September a special court, the Council of
Troubles, was set up to try all cases of rebellion and
heresy, and more than 1,000 executions took place

(including those of the counts of Egmond and Hoorne). Orange, summoned to appear
before the court, replied with a dignified Justification of his conduct. But his possessions in
Philip’s dominions were confiscated, and his son Philip William, a student at Leuven
(Louvain), was deported to Spain.
Once again the cause of liberty, no less than that of religion, was clearly seen to be at stake.
The opposition, however secret, became much more widespread, and Orange was justified
in expecting a general rising when he should appear as a liberator. He saw his own fortunes
irrevocably bound up with those of the Netherlands, and he no longer hesitated to proceed
to military action. Though disappointed in his hopes of substantial support from the
Lutheran German princes (he himself had reverted to the creed of his childhood) or from
the emperor Maximilian II, he managed, mainly through the aid of his relatives, to raise a
number of troops. In April 1568 two invasions of the Low Countries were inaugurated, but
both badly miscarried. One of the attacking forces was destroyed by Alba on the banks of
the Ems River. The prince himself took the field in the beginning of October and marched
toward Brabant, but the expected rising did not materialize, and he was obliged to retire to
France. There he stayed for a time with the Huguenots, the Calvinist party then in rebellion
against the royal government, before returning, in October 1569, to Germany. His brother
Count Louis remained in France as his personal representative. The abortive campaigns had
at least popularized Orange as the champion against oppression. The Calvinists were ready
to forgive him for failing to take up arms in 1566, while he had come to appreciate them as
the hardcore of the resistance movement, though he disliked their Puritanism and
intolerance. Moreover, Calvinism was an “international” power, and from its adherents in
Germany and France he had hitherto received his most effective support. So a
rapprochement took place, but it was not until 1573 that he finally joined the Reformed
Church.
These were his darkest years. With Alba securely in power and his own designs frustrated,
having lost a brother (Adolph) and many of his friends, and bereft of his son, his estates,
and his offices, he was also harassed by financial difficulties and by the wayward conduct
of his wife, Anna of Saxony, whom he divorced in 1571. Orangist propaganda was active,
but military operations were mainly confined to the exploits of the Sea Beggars, who had
taken to the sea to combat the king of Spain from foreign bases. Their blockading activities
contributed to the economic malaise in the Netherlands and so to the discontent nourished
by Alba’s harsh administration. This was especially the case in the seafaring province of
Holland.

For the summer of 1572 Orange planned a number of coordinated attacks, counting on help
from France, but on April 1, well ahead of any officially planned move, a fleet of Sea
Beggars, driven from English ports, surprised and captured the port of Brielle (Den Briel)
in Zuid-Holland. Their success triggered off the desired popular rising in Holland and
Zeeland, most towns declaring themselves for the prince, so that by July only Amsterdam,
Middelburg, and two other towns in Zeeland remained in loyalist hands. On the initiative of
Orange, the provincial States of Holland met at Dordrecht (July 19–23) and recognized the
prince as still being their stadtholder, nominally on behalf of the king, and they themselves
assumed an effective share in the government. Equal rights for Catholics and Calvinists
were proclaimed, pending a decision by the States General, the joint assembly of all the
provinces.
Meanwhile, large parts of Gelderland and Friesland joined the revolt, as Alba and his army
were retained in the south to counter the main attack, which had been launched from
France. Louis of Nassau had captured Mons and was besieged there by the Spanish. Orange
himself marched into Brabant, and several towns opened their gates to him. Hopes of
French support were soon dashed, however, when the Massacre of St. Bartholomew’s Day
destroyed Huguenot influence at the French court. Louis was obliged to capitulate in
September, and Orange disbanded his mercenaries. The fighting in the south had at least
provided breathing space for the rebellious northern provinces to consolidate their position.
The prince decided to join them, landing at Enkhuizen on October 21.
For four heroic years (1572–76), William, the prince of Orange, led the desperate resistance
of the two maritime provinces (Holland and Zeeland) against the Spanish armies sent to
subdue them. Two more of his brothers—Louis and Henry—fell in a serious defeat near
Nijmegen in April 1574. Meanwhile, his agents were active in the subdued provinces, in
England, Germany, and France, and on June 12, 1575, he married Charlotte of Bourbon-
Montpensier, a former abbess who had joined the Reformed Church. The prince needed all
his authority, tact, and tenacity of purpose to hold his followers together and prevent their
pursuing divisive interests. He tried to check the excesses and mitigate the intolerance of
the Protestants but was unable to maintain the equality of the Catholic and Reformed
churches that he had previously advocated, and in 1573 Catholic worship was forbidden. In
the closer unions Orange brought about between the different parts of Holland (July 1575)
and between Holland and Zeeland (April 1576), he was recognized as “Chief and Supreme
Authority” for the duration of the war, but liberty of worship was specifically excluded,
though liberty of conscience was recognized.
The prince’s triumph

A temporary collapse of Spanish power in the Low Countries in 1576 gave the prince a
fresh chance. In the absence of a governor-general after the death of Alba’s successor, Luis
de Requesens y Zúñiga, and confronted with mutinous Spanish troops, the Council of State
ventured to convene the States General. This assembly, pretending to act in the name of the
king but in fact usurping viceregal powers, immediately opened negotiations with the
rebellious provinces. The Pacification of Ghent (November 8, 1576) was the result. It has
been supposed that Orange’s influence and agents were primarily responsible for this
achievement. Certainly this peace, supplemented by the first Union of Brussels (January
1577), heralded the realization of his ambitions and ideals: not only were his governorships
confirmed and his possessions restored to him, but the union of the so-called 17
Netherlands under a national government seemed about to be accomplished. But the idea of
a “common fatherland,” though steadily growing, was not yet strong enough to overcome
particularistic or religious divisions. Because of the Perpetual Edict of 1577, the treaty the
States General concluded with the new governor-general, Don John of Austria, specified
that the Roman Catholic religion was to be maintained all over the country, and because of
the absence of provisions for the maintenance of the Pacification, the deputies of Holland
and Zeeland left the assembly.
In July 1577, however, Don John attempted to renew hostilities, thus driving more and
more people to support the prince. Those towns of Holland and Zeeland that had always
opposed Orange or had been recovered by Spanish arms now recognized his authority; the
last to accede (February 1578) was Amsterdam. The town and province of Utrecht followed
suit, and in Flanders, Brabant, Groningen, and elsewhere, the radical Orangists, mostly
Calvinistic burghers and craftsmen, gained the upper hand. In September 1577 the States
General, to which the representatives of Holland and Zeeland had now returned, invited
Orange to come south to Brussels, where he was triumphantly received. Under his
influence a new union came into being, providing for joint action by both Roman Catholics
and Protestants against “the common enemy of the fatherland.” Meanwhile, the States
General, continuing to act with sovereign power, had formed a government headed by the
young archduke Matthias, an Austrian nephew of King Philip. Matthias agreed to
conditions laid down by the prince guaranteeing a constitutional system of government.
Moreover, in January 1578, Orange was commissioned to act as lieutenant general for
Matthias.
The prince’s failure
Orange was now at the zenith of his career, but his triumph proved as short-lived as was the
general union of the provinces. His failure to consolidate the newly won unity was

primarily due to the excesses of his Calvinist supporters who forcibly introduced popular
and intolerant regimes. Thus, the revolutionaries played into the hands of King Philip’s
new governor-general, Alessandro Farnese, duke of Parma. He was the son of the former
regent Margaret, and on October 1, 1578, he had taken office after the death of Don John.
The Catholic but still anti-Spanish reaction made itself felt first in the southern, French-
speaking provinces. Not unnaturally, when seeking for help, their thoughts turned to
France, but it was on the prince of Orange’s advice that the States General in August 1578
adopted the Catholic duc d’Anjou, brother of Henry III of France, as “Defender of the
Liberty of the Netherlands.” Soon afterward the formation of specific unions by smaller
groups of provinces began to compromise the general union, which was irrevocably
compromised in May 1579 when the prince gave qualified support to the “Union of
Utrecht,” whose main promoter was his brother John, stadtholder of Gelderland and a
staunch Calvinist. On March 15 the prince was outlawed by Philip II and a reward offered
for his assassination. He answered the charges of treason with a vehement Apologie,
written for him by his court chaplain, and he continued to put his trust in France. Against
much Protestant opposition, he persuaded the States General in 1580 to give the duc
d’Anjou the hereditary sovereignty of the Netherlands, and in 1581 they solemnly
renounced their allegiance to the king of Spain. Meanwhile, the provinces of Holland and
Zeeland, unwilling to grant the French prince any direct authority, planned to create Orange
their hereditary count.
Anjou, however, far from aiding the cause of liberty, added to the prevailing confusion.
With great difficulty, Orange effected his reconciliation with the States General. His own
continuing reliance on France is shown by his fourth marriage (1583), to Louise de
Coligny, a daughter of the murdered Huguenot leader the comte de Coligny.
As a result of the ban pronounced by Philip II, an attempt was made on the prince’s life at
Antwerp in March 1582. With Parma advancing from the south, he retired in July 1582 to
Holland, where he moved into his old quarters in a former convent at Delft. There, in 1584,
he was shot by a fanatical Catholic, the Franc-Comtois Balthasar Gérard. His last words
were a prayer for the people he had tried to lead for so long. The family seat of Breda being
then in enemy hands, he was buried in the New Church at Delft.

Family and inheritance William, the eldest son of William, count of Nassau-Dillenburg, grew up in a cultivated Lutheran environment. Far richer than his father’s ancestral possessions in the region of the Lahn River in Nassau were the estates that, since 1404, another branch of the family had obtained in Brabant and elsewhere in the Low Countries, where its main seat was at Breda. At the time of William’s birth, the Brabant branch was represented by his father’s elder brother Henry and by Henry’s only son, René, who in 1530 had inherited from a maternal uncle the domains of the house of Chalon-Arlay, so becoming the greatest seigneur of the Franche-Comté and ruler of the Provençal principality of Orange. René of Orange was killed in 1544, leaving the combined wealth of the houses of Nassau-Breda and of Chalon- Orange to his cousin William, then aged 11. In view of the importance of this heritage, the lord of the Burgundian Netherlands, the Habsburg emperor Charles V, stipulated that William’s parents should renounce his guardianship and that the young prince should be educated in his new fatherland as a Catholic. So William passed his formative years at Breda and Brussels, under the guidance of suitable tutors, and was duly imbued with the principles proper to a youth of his standing. French became his daily language, and he acquired a colloquial command of Dutch. In spite of his immense landed property, his financial circumstances were straitened from the beginning. Scarcity of liquid assets continued to hamper him, even after his marriage (July 8, 1551) to a wealthy heiress, Countess Anne of Egmond-Buren, who brought him  William I   several additional baronies, mainly in Holland. These “structural” pecuniary straits he shared with most of his class and with the Burgundian government itself. A favourite with Charles V and with the court at Brussels, the prince faithfully discharged the social, military, and diplomatic duties that were expected of him. He continued to do so under Philip II, the emperor’s son and successor as king of Spain and lord of the Burgundian dominions. Together with his later enemies Antoine Perrenot de Granvelle, bishop of Arras, and the duke of Alba, he was a negotiator of the Treaty of Cateau- Cambrésis (1559), which, in ending prolonged strife between Burgundy-Habsburg and France, released from French occupation his princedom of Orange and made the Netherlands accessible to Calvinist preachers from France. Philip II, at his accession in 1555, had admitted William to the Council of State, and, now before his departure to Spain, the king appointed him his stadtholder (governor and commander in chief) in Holland, Zeeland, and Utrecht (August 1559) and afterward in Franche-Comté (February 1561). Loyal opposition to the king’s government From about 1561 William, the prince of Orange, together with other great lords who felt themselves excluded from their rightful share in the country’s government, began to protest openly against the conduct of the Brussels administration, in which Granvelle, the principal adviser of the regent Margaret, duchess of Parma, was the most powerful figure. At first religious questions were not prominent among the causes of discontent, but they gradually became so with the spread of Protestant ideas and the determination of Philip II not to tolerate any deviation from the strictest Catholic orthodoxy. The prince and his associates, in varying degrees influenced by the comprehensive views of the humanist Desiderius Erasmus, shared in this respect the feelings of the majority of their countrymen, who, while remaining conventional Roman Catholics, resented religious persecution. Besides, several of the nobles had, as had William, friends and parents among the Protestants. On August 25, 1561, the prince, a widower since 1558, reinforced his Lutheran and German connections by taking as his second wife Anna of Saxony. In the mind of William, the prince of Orange, the religious issue gradually assumed paramount importance. In a sensational speech in the Council of State, he argued that it was not feasible to enforce religious unity and that it was not right for princes to presume to rule over the consciences of their subjects. But the king in October 1565 gave strict orders that the ordinances against heretics should be inexorably applied. William I   William I Consequently, the situation became increasingly dangerous. The leadership of the opposition was now taken over by a confederation of lesser nobles and gentlemen, some of them Calvinists, who were more desperate than the grandees and less averse to a violent solution; they and their followers soon came to be called the Gueux (Beggars). The great lords kept aloof, but William and a few others showed sympathy for the movement, with which the prince was personally in touch through his brother, Count Louis of Nassau, a Lutheran with Calvinistic leanings. Orange persuaded the confederates not to resort to armed action but instead to petition the regent Margaret for a suspension of the decrees against Protestants. The duchess did indeed promise a moderation of the anti-heretical measures, but it was already too late for minor relaxations to avert trouble. Misery caused by the economic depression contributed to the violent explosions of religious fanaticism that shook the Low Countries in August 1566. Calvinist mobs forcibly entered churches, smashing the images and destroying the furnishings. Besides causing irreparable damage, these excesses had a threefold effect: peaceful coexistence of Catholics and Protestants became more difficult; the opposition movement was weakened because its responsible members felt it necessary to defend the church; and, finally, it caused King Philip to resort to force in an attempt to crush heresy and rebellion at one blow. To this end, in December 1566, he appointed the duke of Alba as his captain general in the Netherlands. Orange seems to have contemplated immediate active resistance but in the end did nothing because the popular hero Lamoral, count of Egmond, stadtholder of Flanders and Artois, would not support him. William allowed the Protestants, now openly rebellious, to hail him as their defender, but he upheld public order. As hereditary viscount of Antwerp, he quelled an insurrection of the numerous Calvinists there, and he kept the city gates closed to rebels and government forces alike. He protested his loyalty to the king, yet he refused to take the new oath of unconditional obedience that the regent required from all officeholders and prudently retired in April 1567 to the family seat at Dillenburg. Many thousands followed William’s example or had preceded him; a general exodus to England, Germany, and France took place. Open revolt and alliance with Calvinism By May 1567 order was everywhere restored. Nevertheless, in August Alba entered Brussels at the head of a well-trained army and inaugurated a reign of terror. In September a special court, the Council of Troubles, was set up to try all cases of rebellion and heresy, and more than 1,000 executions took place  William I   (including those of the counts of Egmond and Hoorne). Orange, summoned to appear before the court, replied with a dignified Justification of his conduct. But his possessions in Philip’s dominions were confiscated, and his son Philip William, a student at Leuven (Louvain), was deported to Spain. Once again the cause of liberty, no less than that of religion, was clearly seen to be at stake. The opposition, however secret, became much more widespread, and Orange was justified in expecting a general rising when he should appear as a liberator. He saw his own fortunes irrevocably bound up with those of the Netherlands, and he no longer hesitated to proceed to military action. Though disappointed in his hopes of substantial support from the Lutheran German princes (he himself had reverted to the creed of his childhood) or from the emperor Maximilian II, he managed, mainly through the aid of his relatives, to raise a number of troops. In April 1568 two invasions of the Low Countries were inaugurated, but both badly miscarried. One of the attacking forces was destroyed by Alba on the banks of the Ems River. The prince himself took the field in the beginning of October and marched toward Brabant, but the expected rising did not materialize, and he was obliged to retire to France. There he stayed for a time with the Huguenots, the Calvinist party then in rebellion against the royal government, before returning, in October 1569, to Germany. His brother Count Louis remained in France as his personal representative. The abortive campaigns had at least popularized Orange as the champion against oppression. The Calvinists were ready to forgive him for failing to take up arms in 1566, while he had come to appreciate them as the hardcore of the resistance movement, though he disliked their Puritanism and intolerance. Moreover, Calvinism was an “international” power, and from its adherents in Germany and France he had hitherto received his most effective support. So a rapprochement took place, but it was not until 1573 that he finally joined the Reformed Church. These were his darkest years. With Alba securely in power and his own designs frustrated, having lost a brother (Adolph) and many of his friends, and bereft of his son, his estates, and his offices, he was also harassed by financial difficulties and by the wayward conduct of his wife, Anna of Saxony, whom he divorced in 1571. Orangist propaganda was active, but military operations were mainly confined to the exploits of the Sea Beggars, who had taken to the sea to combat the king of Spain from foreign bases. Their blockading activities contributed to the economic malaise in the Netherlands and so to the discontent nourished by Alba’s harsh administration. This was especially the case in the seafaring province of Holland. William I   For the summer of 1572 Orange planned a number of coordinated attacks, counting on help from France, but on April 1, well ahead of any officially planned move, a fleet of Sea Beggars, driven from English ports, surprised and captured the port of Brielle (Den Briel) in Zuid-Holland. Their success triggered off the desired popular rising in Holland and Zeeland, most towns declaring themselves for the prince, so that by July only Amsterdam, Middelburg, and two other towns in Zeeland remained in loyalist hands. On the initiative of Orange, the provincial States of Holland met at Dordrecht (July 19–23) and recognized the prince as still being their stadtholder, nominally on behalf of the king, and they themselves assumed an effective share in the government. Equal rights for Catholics and Calvinists were proclaimed, pending a decision by the States General, the joint assembly of all the provinces. Meanwhile, large parts of Gelderland and Friesland joined the revolt, as Alba and his army were retained in the south to counter the main attack, which had been launched from France. Louis of Nassau had captured Mons and was besieged there by the Spanish. Orange himself marched into Brabant, and several towns opened their gates to him. Hopes of French support were soon dashed, however, when the Massacre of St. Bartholomew’s Day destroyed Huguenot influence at the French court. Louis was obliged to capitulate in September, and Orange disbanded his mercenaries. The fighting in the south had at least provided breathing space for the rebellious northern provinces to consolidate their position. The prince decided to join them, landing at Enkhuizen on October 21. For four heroic years (1572–76), William, the prince of Orange, led the desperate resistance of the two maritime provinces (Holland and Zeeland) against the Spanish armies sent to subdue them. Two more of his brothers—Louis and Henry—fell in a serious defeat near Nijmegen in April 1574. Meanwhile, his agents were active in the subdued provinces, in England, Germany, and France, and on June 12, 1575, he married Charlotte of Bourbon- Montpensier, a former abbess who had joined the Reformed Church. The prince needed all his authority, tact, and tenacity of purpose to hold his followers together and prevent their pursuing divisive interests. He tried to check the excesses and mitigate the intolerance of the Protestants but was unable to maintain the equality of the Catholic and Reformed churches that he had previously advocated, and in 1573 Catholic worship was forbidden. In the closer unions Orange brought about between the different parts of Holland (July 1575) and between Holland and Zeeland (April 1576), he was recognized as “Chief and Supreme Authority” for the duration of the war, but liberty of worship was specifically excluded, though liberty of conscience was recognized. The prince’s triumph  William I   A temporary collapse of Spanish power in the Low Countries in 1576 gave the prince a fresh chance. In the absence of a governor-general after the death of Alba’s successor, Luis de Requesens y Zúñiga, and confronted with mutinous Spanish troops, the Council of State ventured to convene the States General. This assembly, pretending to act in the name of the king but in fact usurping viceregal powers, immediately opened negotiations with the rebellious provinces. The Pacification of Ghent (November 8, 1576) was the result. It has been supposed that Orange’s influence and agents were primarily responsible for this achievement. Certainly this peace, supplemented by the first Union of Brussels (January 1577), heralded the realization of his ambitions and ideals: not only were his governorships confirmed and his possessions restored to him, but the union of the so-called 17 Netherlands under a national government seemed about to be accomplished. But the idea of a “common fatherland,” though steadily growing, was not yet strong enough to overcome particularistic or religious divisions. Because of the Perpetual Edict of 1577, the treaty the States General concluded with the new governor-general, Don John of Austria, specified that the Roman Catholic religion was to be maintained all over the country, and because of the absence of provisions for the maintenance of the Pacification, the deputies of Holland and Zeeland left the assembly. In July 1577, however, Don John attempted to renew hostilities, thus driving more and more people to support the prince. Those towns of Holland and Zeeland that had always opposed Orange or had been recovered by Spanish arms now recognized his authority; the last to accede (February 1578) was Amsterdam. The town and province of Utrecht followed suit, and in Flanders, Brabant, Groningen, and elsewhere, the radical Orangists, mostly Calvinistic burghers and craftsmen, gained the upper hand. In September 1577 the States General, to which the representatives of Holland and Zeeland had now returned, invited Orange to come south to Brussels, where he was triumphantly received. Under his influence a new union came into being, providing for joint action by both Roman Catholics and Protestants against “the common enemy of the fatherland.” Meanwhile, the States General, continuing to act with sovereign power, had formed a government headed by the young archduke Matthias, an Austrian nephew of King Philip. Matthias agreed to conditions laid down by the prince guaranteeing a constitutional system of government. Moreover, in January 1578, Orange was commissioned to act as lieutenant general for Matthias. The prince’s failure Orange was now at the zenith of his career, but his triumph proved as short-lived as was the general union of the provinces. His failure to consolidate the newly won unity was  William I   primarily due to the excesses of his Calvinist supporters who forcibly introduced popular and intolerant regimes. Thus, the revolutionaries played into the hands of King Philip’s new governor-general, Alessandro Farnese, duke of Parma. He was the son of the former regent Margaret, and on October 1, 1578, he had taken office after the death of Don John. The Catholic but still anti-Spanish reaction made itself felt first in the southern, French- speaking provinces. Not unnaturally, when seeking for help, their thoughts turned to France, but it was on the prince of Orange’s advice that the States General in August 1578 adopted the Catholic duc d’Anjou, brother of Henry III of France, as “Defender of the Liberty of the Netherlands.” Soon afterward the formation of specific unions by smaller groups of provinces began to compromise the general union, which was irrevocably compromised in May 1579 when the prince gave qualified support to the “Union of Utrecht,” whose main promoter was his brother John, stadtholder of Gelderland and a staunch Calvinist. On March 15 the prince was outlawed by Philip II and a reward offered for his assassination. He answered the charges of treason with a vehement Apologie, written for him by his court chaplain, and he continued to put his trust in France. Against much Protestant opposition, he persuaded the States General in 1580 to give the duc d’Anjou the hereditary sovereignty of the Netherlands, and in 1581 they solemnly renounced their allegiance to the king of Spain. Meanwhile, the provinces of Holland and Zeeland, unwilling to grant the French prince any direct authority, planned to create Orange their hereditary count. Anjou, however, far from aiding the cause of liberty, added to the prevailing confusion. With great difficulty, Orange effected his reconciliation with the States General. His own continuing reliance on France is shown by his fourth marriage (1583), to Louise de Coligny, a daughter of the murdered Huguenot leader the comte de Coligny. As a result of the ban pronounced by Philip II, an attempt was made on the prince’s life at Antwerp in March 1582. With Parma advancing from the south, he retired in July 1582 to Holland, where he moved into his old quarters in a former convent at Delft. There, in 1584, he was shot by a fanatical Catholic, the Franc-Comtois Balthasar Gérard. His last words were a prayer for the people he had tried to lead for so long. The family seat of Breda being then in enemy hands, he was buried in the New Church at Delft. Adriaan G. Jongkees The Editors of Encyclopaedia Britannica  William I",

Bangor, Caernarvonshire, Wales), Irish patriot who
was a leader of the literary-political Young Ireland
movement along with Thomas Osborne Davis,
Charles Gavan Duffy, and John Dillon.
O’Brien sat in the British House of Commons from 1828 to 1848. Although he was a
Protestant, he actively favoured Roman Catholic emancipation, but he also wished to
maintain the Anglo-Irish legislative union (in force from Aug. 1, 1800). In 1828, therefore,
he opposed the parliamentary candidacy in County Clare of Daniel O’Connell, who was the
leading advocate of Catholic political rights and Irish self-government. He continued to
support the union until 1843, when he was angered by the British imprisonment of
O’Connell. In October of that year O’Brien joined the anti-union Repeal Association,
serving as deputy leader while O’Connell was in jail.
On July 27, 1846, after O’Connell had advised against the use of force, O’Brien led the
Young Irelanders in withdrawing from the association. In January 1847 they formed the
Irish Confederation to press for more effective famine relief. In May 1848, after traveling
to Paris to congratulate the leaders of the new French republic, O’Brien was tried for
sedition, but the proceedings ended in a hung jury. He then joined his political colleague
Thomas Francis Meagher in advocating a violent revolution. On July 29, 1848, he led a
futile rising of peasants against police at Ballingarry, County Tipperary. Arrested and
convicted of high treason, he received a death sentence, which was commuted to life exile
to Tasmania. Following his release in February 1854, he lived in Brussels until he was
granted a full pardon in May 1856.

William Thomas Cosgrave
William Thomas Cosgrave, (born June 5, 1880,
Dublin, Ire.—died Nov. 16, 1965, Dublin), Irish
statesman, who was the first president of the
Executive Council (prime minister; 1922–32) of the
Irish Free State.
At an early age, Cosgrave was attracted to the Irish
nationalist party Sinn Féin. He became a member of the Dublin Corporation in 1909 and
was subsequently reelected to represent Sinn Féin interests. He joined the Irish Volunteers
in 1913, and, when the group split in 1914 upon the outbreak of World War I, Cosgrave
sided with a radical Sinn Féin minority against the constitutional nationalists led by John
Redmond, who supported the British war effort.
Cosgrave took part in the Easter Rising (1916) and was afterward interned by the British
for a short time. In 1917 he was elected to Parliament for the city of Kilkenny. In the
sweeping election victory of Sinn Féin in 1918, he became a member of the first Dáil
Éireann (Irish Assembly). He was made minister for local government in the first
republican ministry, and during the Anglo-Irish War (1919–21) his task was to organize the
refusal of local bodies to cooperate with the British in Dublin.
Cosgrave was a supporter of the 1921 treaty settlement with Great Britain, and he became
minister of local government in Ireland’s provisional government of 1922. Cosgrave
replaced Michael Collins as chairman of the provisional government when the latter
became commander in chief of the army in July 1922. Cosgrave also replaced Arthur
Griffith as president of the Dáil after Griffith’s sudden death on Aug. 12, 1922. As the first
president (from December 1922) of the Executive Council of the Irish Free State, Cosgrave
—who had helped found the political party Cumann na nGaedheal (“Party of the Irish”) in
April 1923 and became its leader—represented Ireland at the Imperial Conference in
October 1923. A month earlier he had been welcomed as Ireland’s first spokesman at the
assembly of the League of Nations.
Cosgrave’s greatest achievement was to establish stable democratic government in Ireland
after the civil war of 1922–23. In the Dáil there was no serious opposition, since the party
headed by Eamon de Valera, which refused to take the oath prescribed in the treaty,
abstained from attendance. But neither Cosgrave nor his ministry enjoyed much popularity.

Order required drastic measures, and taxation was heavy and sharply collected. Cosgrave
seemed sure of a long tenure only because there was no alternative in sight.
In July 1927, shortly after a general election, the assassination of Kevin O’Higgins, the
vice president, produced a crisis. The Executive Council introduced a Public Safety Act,
which legislated severely against political associations of an unconstitutional character, and
introduced a bill declaring that no candidature for the Dáil should be accepted unless the
candidate declared willingness to take a seat in the Dáil and to take the oath of allegiance.
The result of this measure was that de Valera and his party decided to attend sessions in the
Dáil, and, since this greatly altered the parliamentary situation, Cosgrave obtained leave to
dissolve the assembly and hold a general election. The election in September 1927 left his
party numerically the largest in the Dáil but without an overall majority. He continued in
office until de Valera’s victory at the general election of 1932. Cumann na nGaedheal
joined with two smaller opposition parties in September 1933 to form a new party headed
by Cosgrave, Fine Gael (“Irish Race”), which became Ireland’s main opposition party. In
1944 Cosgrave resigned from the leadership of Fine Gael.

At an early age, Cosgrave was attracted to the Irish nationalist party Sinn Féin. He became a member of the Dublin Corporation in 1909 and was subsequently reelected to represent Sinn Féin interests. He joined the Irish Volunteers in 1913, and, when the group split in 1914 upon the outbreak of World War I, Cosgrave sided with a radical Sinn Féin minority against the constitutional nationalists led by John Redmond, who supported the British war effort. Cosgrave took part in the Easter Rising (1916) and was afterward interned by the British for a short time. In 1917 he was elected to Parliament for the city of Kilkenny. In the sweeping election victory of Sinn Féin in 1918, he became a member of the first Dáil Éireann (Irish Assembly). He was made minister for local government in the first republican ministry, and during the Anglo-Irish War (1919–21) his task was to organize the refusal of local bodies to cooperate with the British in Dublin. Cosgrave was a supporter of the 1921 treaty settlement with Great Britain, and he became minister of local government in Ireland’s provisional government of 1922. Cosgrave replaced Michael Collins as chairman of the provisional government when the latter became commander in chief of the army in July 1922. Cosgrave also replaced Arthur Griffith as president of the Dáil after Griffith’s sudden death on Aug. 12, 1922. As the first president (from December 1922) of the Executive Council of the Irish Free State, Cosgrave —who had helped found the political party Cumann na nGaedheal (“Party of the Irish”) in April 1923 and became its leader—represented Ireland at the Imperial Conference in October 1923. A month earlier he had been welcomed as Ireland’s first spokesman at the assembly of the League of Nations. Cosgrave’s greatest achievement was to establish stable democratic government in Ireland after the civil war of 1922–23. In the Dáil there was no serious opposition, since the party headed by Eamon de Valera, which refused to take the oath prescribed in the treaty, abstained from attendance. But neither Cosgrave nor his ministry enjoyed much popularity. William Thomas Cosgrave   Order required drastic measures, and taxation was heavy and sharply collected. Cosgrave seemed sure of a long tenure only because there was no alternative in sight. In July 1927, shortly after a general election, the assassination of Kevin O’Higgins, the vice president, produced a crisis. The Executive Council introduced a Public Safety Act, which legislated severely against political associations of an unconstitutional character, and introduced a bill declaring that no candidature for the Dáil should be accepted unless the candidate declared willingness to take a seat in the Dáil and to take the oath of allegiance. The result of this measure was that de Valera and his party decided to attend sessions in the Dáil, and, since this greatly altered the parliamentary situation, Cosgrave obtained leave to dissolve the assembly and hold a general election. The election in September 1927 left his party numerically the largest in the Dáil but without an overall majority. He continued in office until de Valera’s victory at the general election of 1932. Cumann na nGaedheal joined with two smaller opposition parties in September 1933 to form a new party headed by Cosgrave, Fine Gael (“Irish Race”), which became Ireland’s main opposition party. In 1944 Cosgrave resigned from the leadership of Fine Gael. This article was most recently revised and updated by Lorraine Murray.",

Wojciech Korfanty
Wojciech Korfanty, (born April 20, 1873, Siemianowice, Upper Silesia, Ger. [now in
Poland]—died Aug. 17, 1939, Warsaw), political leader who played a major role in the
national reawakening of the Poles of Upper Silesia and who led their struggle for
independence from Germany.
The son of a miner, Korfanty became a journalist and a member of the secret nationalist
society “Z,” which resisted Germany’s attempt to Germanize Upper Silesia’s Polish
population. He became Upper Silesia’s first Polish member of the Reichstag (the German
parliament) in 1903, being reelected in 1907 and 1918, and served in the Prussian Diet
from 1904 to 1918—to the dismay of the Prussian administration, the Catholic hierarchy,
and local capitalists. After World War I he led the Polish demand for an Upper Silesian
plebiscite. Although the majority of Silesian voters decided in favour of remaining part of
Germany, Korfanty’s campaign efforts resulted in a pro-Polish majority in the southeastern
industrial section of Upper Silesia (March 1921). After he had led an armed rebellion (May
1921), he induced the Allies to set the German–Polish border along a line in Silesia more
favourable to Poland than previously intended.
In the newly restored Poland, he sat in the Constituent Assembly (1919–22) and the
Parliament (1922–30) as a leader of the national bloc. Opposed to Józef Piłsudski’s
dictatorial methods, he was imprisoned in 1930 but was soon released and entered the
Senate. Having lived in Czechoslovakia from 1935, he returned to Poland on April 29,
1939, was arrested, and died soon after his release.

Wolfe Tone
Wolfe Tone, in full Theobald Wolfe Tone, (born June 20, 1763, Dublin, Ire.—died Nov.
19, 1798, Dublin), Irish republican and rebel who sought to overthrow English rule in
Ireland and who led a French military force to Ireland during the insurrection of 1798.
The son of a coach maker, Tone studied law and was called to the Irish bar (1789) but soon
gave up his practice. In October 1791 he helped found the Society of United Irishmen,
initially a predominantly Protestant organization that worked for parliamentary reforms,
such as universal suffrage and Roman Catholic emancipation. In Dublin in 1792 he
organized a Roman Catholic convention of elected delegates that forced Parliament to pass
the Catholic Relief Act of 1793. Tone himself, however, was anticlerical and hoped for a
general revolt against religious creeds in Ireland as a sequel to the attainment of Irish
political freedom.
By 1794 he and his United Irishmen friends began to seek armed aid from Revolutionary
France to help overthrow English rule. After an initial effort failed, Tone went to the United
States and obtained letters of introduction from the French minister at Philadelphia to the
Committee of Public Safety in Paris. In February 1796 Tone arrived in the French capital,
presented his plan for a French invasion of Ireland, and was favourably received. The
Directory then appointed one of the most brilliant young French generals, Lazare Hoche, to
command the expedition and made Tone an adjutant in the French army.
On Dec. 16, 1796, Tone sailed from Brest with 43 ships and nearly 14,000 men. But the
ships were badly handled and, after reaching the coast of west Cork and Kerry, were
dispersed by a storm. Tone again brought an Irish invasion plan to Paris in October 1797,
but the principal French military leader, Napoleon Bonaparte, took little interest. When
insurrection broke out in Ireland in May 1798, Tone could only obtain enough French
forces to make small raids on different parts of the Irish coast. In September he entered
Lough Swilly, Donegal, with 3,000 men and was captured there.
On November 10 at his trial in Dublin he defiantly proclaimed his undying hostility to
England and his desire “in fair and open war to produce the separation of the two
countries.” Early in the morning of November 12, the day he was to be hanged, he cut his
throat with a penknife and died seven days later.

Xanana Gusmão
Xanana Gusmão, byname of José Alexandre Gusmão, (born June 20, 1946, Manatulo,
East Timor), East Timorese independence leader and politician who served as the first
president (2002–07) and fourth prime minister (2007–15) of East Timor.
Gusmão, the son of schoolteachers, went to high school in Dili, East Timor, which at the
time was a Portuguese possession, and later attended the Jesuit seminary in nearby Dare.
He served for three years in the colonial armed forces and worked as a surveyor and as a
teacher. In August 1975, after an attempted coup by the nationalist Timorese Democratic
Union (União Democrática Timorense; UDT) was quelled by the competing group, Fretilin
(Frente Revolucionária do Timor-Leste Independente [Revolutionary Front for an
Independent East Timor]), the Portuguese administrators left East Timor. For a short period
thereafter Gusmão, a member of Fretilin, helped administer the region. Indonesia invaded
East Timor in December 1975 and annexed it as a province. Gusmão was subsequently at
the forefront of the resistance movement against the Indonesian presence, becoming head
of Falintil (Forças Armadas de Liberação Nacional de Timor-Leste [Armed Forces for the
National Liberation of East Timor]), a revolutionary group that operated from hiding places
in the mountains.
In 1992 Gusmão was captured by Indonesian forces, and the following year he was
sentenced to life in prison for plotting against the Indonesian government and for illegal
possession of arms. The sentence was later shortened to 20 years, and, as part of a
settlement brokered by the United Nations (UN), he was released to house arrest in
February 1999. Along with resistance leaders José Ramos-Horta and Bishop Carlos Belo,
who together shared the 1996 Nobel Prize for Peace, Gusmão took part in talks with the
Indonesian government, and a cease-fire was established on June 18, 1999. On August 30
the East Timorese participated in a referendum to choose between autonomy within
Indonesia and independence. By an overwhelming majority the people voted for
independence, and Indonesia began to withdraw its troops. On October 25 the UN Security
Council established a transitional government, UNTAET (United Nations Transitional
Administration of East Timor). As president of the National Council of Timorese
Resistance (Conselho Nacional de Resistência Timorense; CNRT), Gusmão was appointed
to a senior role in UNTAET.
In April 2002 East Timor held a presidential election, and Gusmão easily won. He took
office on May 20, when East Timor officially became independent. As president, he

Xanana Gusmão
oversaw the country’s admittance into the UN in 2002
and into ASEAN in 2005. He also worked to develop
East Timor’s economy, which relied heavily on the
petroleum industry. In 2006 he called for the
resignation of Prime Minister Mari Alkatiri, who was
alleged to have ordered the intimidation and
assassination of political opponents. The allegations
resulted in mass protests, and Alkatiri stepped down in June.
Gusmão chose not to seek a second term as president, instead opting to pursue the prime
ministership. In the June 2007 parliamentary elections, the CNRT—renamed (with the
same acronym) National Congress for the Reconstruction of Timor (Congresso Nacional de
Reconstrução do Timor)—placed second behind Fretilin, which failed to win a majority.
Gusmão subsequently orchestrated the formation of a governing coalition headed by his
party, and Pres. José Ramos-Horta named him prime minister. Gusmão was sworn into
office on August 8, 2007, which was met by two days of rioting in Dili.
In February 2008 President Ramos-Horta was nearly assassinated in Dili, plunging the
country into political crisis. Gusmão weathered the situation, and gradually peace returned.
East Timor’s economy grew significantly during his first term as prime minister, but many
of the country’s citizens continued to live in poverty. The CNRT won a plurality (but not a
majority) of seats in the 2012 parliamentary elections, and Gusmão returned for a second
term as prime minister of another coalition government. In 2014, however, he announced
his intention to retire. He left office on February 16, 2015, succeeded by Rui Maria de
Araújo of Fretilin, who named Gusmão the minister of planning and strategic development.

Along with resistance leaders José Ramos-Horta and Bishop Carlos Belo, who together shared the 1996 Nobel Prize for Peace, Gusmão took part in talks with the Indonesian government, and a cease-fire was established on June 18, 1999. On August 30 the East Timorese participated in a referendum to choose between autonomy within Indonesia and independence. By an overwhelming majority the people voted for independence, and Indonesia began to withdraw its troops. On October 25 the UN Security Council established a transitional government, UNTAET (United Nations Transitional Administration of East Timor). As president of the National Council of Timorese Resistance (Conselho Nacional de Resistência Timorense; CNRT), Gusmão was appointed to a senior role in UNTAET. In April 2002 East Timor held a presidential election, and Gusmão easily won. He took office on May 20, when East Timor officially became independent. As president, he  Xanana Gusmão   Xanana Gusmão oversaw the country’s admittance into the UN in 2002 and into ASEAN in 2005. He also worked to develop East Timor’s economy, which relied heavily on the petroleum industry. In 2006 he called for the resignation of Prime Minister Mari Alkatiri, who was alleged to have ordered the intimidation and assassination of political opponents. The allegations resulted in mass protests, and Alkatiri stepped down in June. Gusmão chose not to seek a second term as president, instead opting to pursue the prime ministership. In the June 2007 parliamentary elections, the CNRT—renamed (with the same acronym) National Congress for the Reconstruction of Timor (Congresso Nacional de Reconstrução do Timor)—placed second behind Fretilin, which failed to win a majority. Gusmão subsequently orchestrated the formation of a governing coalition headed by his party, and Pres. José Ramos-Horta named him prime minister. Gusmão was sworn into office on August 8, 2007, which was met by two days of rioting in Dili. In February 2008 President Ramos-Horta was nearly assassinated in Dili, plunging the country into political crisis. Gusmão weathered the situation, and gradually peace returned. East Timor’s economy grew significantly during his first term as prime minister, but many of the country’s citizens continued to live in poverty. The CNRT won a plurality (but not a majority) of seats in the 2012 parliamentary elections, and Gusmão returned for a second term as prime minister of another coalition government. In 2014, however, he announced his intention to retire. He left office on February 16, 2015, succeeded by Rui Maria de Araújo of Fretilin, who named Gusmão the minister of planning and strategic development.

Yaḥyā
Yaḥyā, in full Yaḥyā Maḥmūd al-Mutawakkil, (born 1867, Yemen—died Feb. 17, 1948,
Sanaa, Yemen), Zaydī imam of Yemen from 1904 to 1948.
When Yaḥyā was a child, Yemen was a province of the Ottoman Empire. His youth was
spent in the service of his father’s administration, and, when his father died in 1904, Yaḥyā
succeeded him as imam. The Yemenis had always resented Turkish rule, and Yaḥyā was
soon able to assemble a potent military force. Sporadic warfare lasted until 1911, when he
was able to force the Turks to recognize the autonomy of his personal rule over the Yemen.
He remained loyal to the Turks when World War I broke out but did not take an active part
in the hostilities. At the close of the war he was recognized as the independent ruler of the
Yemen, but there was no agreement on just which territories composed the country.
Yaḥyā clashed with the British, who had a military base in Aden and who considered many
of the neighbouring tribes to be under their protection. He also clashed with his Arab
neighbours along the Red Sea coast in the province of Asir. War with the Saudis broke out
in 1934, just after the conclusion of the treaty with Great Britain, and Yaḥyā suffered a
decisive defeat. King Ibn Saʿūd was generous; he forced the imam to make no territorial
concessions and permitted a reversion to the prewar status quo. Thereafter foreign affairs
ceased to be a dominant concern, and Yaḥyā directed his attention mostly to stabilization at
home.
The hallmark of his rule was isolation from the outside world. His military power was
based on the support of the Zaydī tribesmen of the interior highlands, while he
administered the country through a small class of nobles known as sayyids. Yaḥyā himself
secured what amounted to a monopoly of Yemen’s foreign trade. He was most concerned
that no foreign influences disrupt this delicate equilibrium. He received some economic
and military aid from the Italians in the 1920s and ’30s but firmly refused close contacts,
such as an exchange of diplomatic missions. During World War II he remained neutral, but
trouble began afterward, when the British strengthened their position in Aden and Yemenis
who were discontented with Yaḥyā’s isolationist autocracy looked to them for support.
Yemenis abroad also supported the domestic dissidents, but opposition did not become
active until 1946. Two years later the aged imam was assassinated.

Yitzhak Shamir
Yitzḥak Shamir
Yitzḥak Shamir, original name Yitzḥak Jazernicki,
also spelled Yezernitzky, Yizernitsky, or
Ysernitzky, (born October 15, 1915, Ruzinoy,
Poland, Russian Empire [now Ruzhany, Belarus]—
died June 30, 2012, Tel Aviv–Yafo, Israel), Polish-
born Zionist leader and prime minister of Israel in
1983–84 and 1986–90 (in alliance with Shimon Peres
of the Labour Party) and in 1990–92.
Shamir joined the Beitar Zionist youth movement as a young man and studied law in
Warsaw. He immigrated to Palestine in 1935 and enrolled at the Hebrew University in
Jerusalem. There he joined the Irgun Zvai Leumi (IZL) underground movement; and in
1940, following a policy split in the IZL, he joined the Israel Freedom Fighters (IFF), a
terrorist group later known as the Stern Gang (after its founder, Abraham Stern).
Following the death of Stern, Shamir played a central part in reorganizing the Sternist
Central Committee. Shamir was arrested by the British-mandate authorities in 1941 and
1946. After his second escape from internment, he made his way to France, where he was
granted asylum. He returned to Israel in May 1948 and then served as a Mossad secret-
service operative in Europe until 1965. After engaging in private commerce for a time, he
joined Menachem Begin’s Herut movement, which in 1973 joined with other smaller
parties to form the Likud. In March 1975 Shamir was elected chairman of the party
executive of Herut. First elected to the Knesset (Israeli parliament) in 1973, he became
speaker of the Knesset after the Likud’s electoral victory in 1977.
Begin, as prime minister, appointed Shamir to be
minister of foreign affairs in March 1980. In
September 1983 the Likud Party elected Shamir to
succeed the retiring Begin as its new leader, but he
lost the prime ministry in the indecisive elections of
July 1984. In September 1984 Shamir, the Likud
hard-liner, and Shimon Peres, head of the Labour Party, formed a makeshift coalition
government in which Peres served as prime minister for the first half of a 50-month term
and Shamir served as deputy prime minister and foreign minister; the roles were reversed
for the second 25 months, and Shamir thus assumed the office of prime minister in October

1986. After similarly indecisive elections in 1988, the Likud and Labour parties formed
another coalition government, with Shamir as prime minister. In 1990, after his government
fell, Shamir eventually succeeded in forming his own coalition government (without
Labour), including several representatives of ultraconservative groups. In the general
elections of 1992, the Likud lost and Shamir’s government fell.

ʿAbbās II
ʿAbbās II, also called ʿAbbās Ḥilmī II, (born July 14, 1874, Alexandria, Egypt—died
Dec. 20, 1944, Geneva, Switz.), last khedive (viceroy) of Egypt, from 1892 to 1914, when
British hegemony was established. His opposition to British power in Egypt made him
prominent in the nationalist movement.
ʿAbbās became khedive following the sudden death of his father, Tawfīq Pasha, in 1892,
while ʿAbbās was enrolled at the Theresianum in Vienna. At the beginning of his reign,
ʿAbbās attempted to rule independently of Lord Cromer, the British agent and consul
general in Egypt (1883–1907). Encouraged by popular discontent with the increasing
British influence over Egypt and by the enthusiastic support of the nationalists, ʿAbbās
appointed a prime minister who was well-known for his opposition to the British. When in
1894 he criticized the military efficiency of the British troops, Lord Cromer took steps to
curb the khedive’s independence of action.
After 1894, although ʿAbbās no longer headed the nationalist movement, he provided
financial assistance to the pan-Islamic and anti-British daily newspaper Al-Muʿayyad (“The
Supporter”). When in 1906 the nationalists demanded constitutional government for Egypt,
however, ʿAbbās, now reconciled with the British, rejected their demands. The following
year he agreed to the formation of the National Party, headed by Muṣṭafā Kāmil, to counter
the Ummah Party of the moderate nationalists, which was supported by the British. With
the appointment of Lord Kitchener as consul general (1912–14), the leaders of the National
Party were exiled or imprisoned, and ʿAbbās’s authority was curtailed.
At the beginning of World War I, ʿAbbās issued an appeal to the Egyptians and the
Sudanese to support the Central Powers and to fight the British. On Dec. 18, 1914, Britain
declared Egypt its protectorate and deposed ʿAbbās the following day. His uncle Ḥusayn
Kāmil (reigned 1914–17) replaced him and assumed the title of sultan. In 1922, when
Egypt was declared independent, ʿAbbās lost all rights to the throne. He passed the rest of
his life in exile, mainly in Switzerland.
